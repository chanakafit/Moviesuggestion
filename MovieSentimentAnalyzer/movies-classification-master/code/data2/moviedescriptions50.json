[{"Plot": "In this dramatic courtroom thriller, LT Daniel Kaffee, a Navy lawyer who has never seen the inside of the courtroom, defends two stubborn Marines who have been accused of murdering a colleague. Kaffee is known as being lazy and had arranged for a plea bargain. Downey's Aunt Ginny appoints Cmdr. Galloway to represent him. Also on the legal staff is LTJG Sam Weinberg. The team rounds up many facts and Kaffee is discovering that he is really cut out for trial work. The defense is originally based upon the fact that PFC Santiago, the victim, was given a \"CODE RED\". Santiago was basically a screw-up. At Gitmo, screw-ups aren't tolerated. Especially by Col. Nathan Jessup. In Cuba, Jessup and two senior officers try to give all the help they can, but Kaffee knows something's fishy. In the conclusion of the film, the fireworks are set off by a confrontation between Jessup and Kaffee.", "Rated": "R", "Response": "True", "Language": "English", "Title": "A Few Good Men", "Country": "USA", "Writer": "Aaron Sorkin (play), Aaron Sorkin (screenplay)", "Metascore": "62", "imdbRating": "7.6", "Director": "Rob Reiner", "Released": "11 Dec 1992", "Actors": "Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon", "Year": "1992", "Genre": "Drama, Thriller", "Awards": "Nominated for 4 Oscars.

Upon his return to work following a heart attack, irrepressible barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts, known as a barrister for the hopeless, takes on a murder case, much to the exasperation of his medical team, led by his overly regulated private nurse, Miss Plimsoll, who tries her hardest to ensure that he not return to his hard living ways - including excessive cigar smoking and drinking - while he takes his medication and gets his much needed rest. That case is defending American war veteran Leonard Vole, a poor, out of work, struggling inventor who is accused of murdering his fifty-six year old lonely and wealthy widowed acquaintance, Emily French. The initial evidence is circumstantial but points to Leonard as the murderer. Despite being happily married to East German former beer hall performer Christine Vole, he fostered that friendship with Mrs. French in the hopes that she would finance one of his many inventions to the tune of a few hundred pounds. It thus does not help his case when it is learned that Mrs. French changed her will prior to her murder with Leonard being the primary beneficiary of a \u00a380,000 estate. Leonard states that he knew nothing about the will. Christine is apparently the only alibi Leonard has to his whereabouts at the time of the murder. The usual methods Sir Wilfrid uses to test his clients' guilt or innocence leads to him believing that Leonard is indeed innocent. As the trial progresses, the prosecution calls a surprise witness, one that could place a nail in the coffin of Sir Wilfrid's planned line of defense. As Sir Wilfrid gets deeper and deeper into the case, something doesn't quite sit right with him, although he doesn't know what it is. The primary questions become how far Sir Wilfrid will go to obtain evidence to acquit Leonard, and if he will ever discover why he feels that there is something odd about the case.", "Rated": "APPROVED", "Response": "True", "Language": "English, German", "Title": "Witness for the Prosecution", "Country": "USA", "Writer": "Agatha Christie (in Agatha Christie's international stage success), Billy Wilder (screen play), Harry Kurnitz (screen play), Lawrence B.

Her dead body is found upstream several weeks later, consistent with the accidental death theory. Based on incidents around him, her grieving husband, architect Jonathan Rivers, decides several months later to visit with Raymond Price, who approached John prior to Anna's body being found with news that she was trying to contact him from beyond. At that time, John was skeptical of Raymond's claims of electronic voice phenomena (EVP): that he is contacted from the beyond through electronic means - radio, television - which he is able to record. Along with Sarah Tate, another of Raymond's \"clients\" whose fianc\u00e9 passed away, John becomes obsessed with EVP as he gets more and more audio and video messages, however fuzzy, from Anna from beyond. That obsession takes a slight change in focus when John believes that Anna is trying to pass along information to help others. But the nature of those messages and their connection to Raymond in combination with John learning that not all good comes through EVP leads to the possible belief that he dabbling in EVP in and of itself may be dangerous and the cause of those potentially deadly issues in which he is supposed to assist in helping. John has to decide whether or not to continue with his work in EVP, not continuing which means that he may actually prevent bad things from happening, and continuing which means that he gets his much wanted connection with Anna.", "Rated": "PG-13", "Response": "True", "Language": "English", "Title": "White Noise", "Country": "UK, Canada, USA", "Writer": "Niall Johnson", "Metascore": "30", "imdbRating": "5.5", "Director": "Geoffrey Sax", "Released": "07 Jan 2005", "Actors": "Michael Keaton, Chandra West, Deborah Kara Unger, Ian McNeice", "Year": "2005", "Genre": "Drama, Horror, Mystery", "Awards": "1 win & 2 nominations.", "Runtime": "101 min", "Type": "movie", "Poster": "http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzNjA2MDk0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjkwODcyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "imdbVotes": "39,447", "imdbID": "tt0375210"}, {"Plot": "A paranormal investigator uses technology and mysticism to bring messages from the deceased.", "Rated": "N/A", "Response": "True", "Language": "English", "Title": "Is There Anything Else?", "Country": "USA", "Writer": "Sean G.
