A company called Zomcon has been able to control the zombie population. Zombies can be temporarily neutralized by being shot, but can only be permanently neutralized by their brain being destroyed. Their ultimate disposal is through cremation, or burial, the latter which requires decapitation with the head being buried separately from the body. Conversely, Zomcon has created the domestication collar, when activated and placed on a zombie makes the zombie controllable and thus an eternally productive creature within society. Because all dead initially become zombies, the elderly are viewed negatively and suspectly. And all people, adult or child, learn to shoot to kill to protect society. Zomcon is the go to organization for all things zombie. In the town of Willard, the Robinsons - father Bill, mother Helen, and adolescent son Timmy - are one family who don't own a zombie as a domestic since Bill is afraid of zombies, as, when he was a child, he had to shoot his own zombie father, who tried to eat him. Bill has thus become fascinated with funerals to see zombies put away permanently. But Helen feels pressured to get a zombie when Zomcon's new head of security in Willard, the officious Jonathan Bottoms, moves into the neighborhood with his family. Never having had to deal with a zombie directly, Timmy is initially wary of their zombie. But as a lonely child who has no friends and is often bullied, Timmy eventually befriends their zombie, who he names Fido, as he treats the zombie much like a faithful pet dog. Timmy protects Fido at all cost, even after Fido, due to no fault of its own, is implicated in some deaths, which creates a mini-wave of loose zombies unknown to Zomcon. But Fido may play a larger role within the family as a companion for Helen, who is largely neglected by Bill, since he sees human affection as ultimately resulting in such difficult issues as what happened between him and his own father. With Timmy and Helen treating Fido with kindness, Fido, in turn, may prove that not all zombies, even when without their domestication collar, are out to kill anyone and everyone in their path.", "Rated": "R", "Response": "True", "Language": "English", "Title": "Fido", "Country": "Canada", "Writer": "Robert Chomiak, Andrew Currie, Dennis Heaton, Dennis Heaton (original story)", "Metascore": "70", "imdbRating": "6.8", "Director": "Andrew Currie", "Released": "16 Mar 2007", "Actors": "David Kaye, Jan Skorzewski, Kevin Tyell, Andy Parkin", "Year": "2006", "Genre": "Comedy, Drama, Horror", "Awards": "13 wins & 15 nominations.", "Runtime": "93 min", "Type": "movie", "Poster": "http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzNjQ4OTYxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY5MDEwNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "imdbVotes": "23,528", "imdbID": "tt0457572"}, {"Plot": "Single father Dan Burns dedicates his life to his children, but one day he meets Marie at a bookstore.
