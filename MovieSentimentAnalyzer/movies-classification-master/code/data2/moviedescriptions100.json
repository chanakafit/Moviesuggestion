[{"Plot": "In this dramatic courtroom thriller, LT Daniel Kaffee, a Navy lawyer who has never seen the inside of the courtroom, defends two stubborn Marines who have been accused of murdering a colleague. Kaffee is known as being lazy and had arranged for a plea bargain. Downey's Aunt Ginny appoints Cmdr. Galloway to represent him. Also on the legal staff is LTJG Sam Weinberg. The team rounds up many facts and Kaffee is discovering that he is really cut out for trial work. The defense is originally based upon the fact that PFC Santiago, the victim, was given a \"CODE RED\". Santiago was basically a screw-up. At Gitmo, screw-ups aren't tolerated. Especially by Col. Nathan Jessup. In Cuba, Jessup and two senior officers try to give all the help they can, but Kaffee knows something's fishy. In the conclusion of the film, the fireworks are set off by a confrontation between Jessup and Kaffee.", "Rated": "R", "Response": "True", "Language": "English", "Title": "A Few Good Men", "Country": "USA", "Writer": "Aaron Sorkin (play), Aaron Sorkin (screenplay)", "Metascore": "62", "imdbRating": "7.6", "Director": "Rob Reiner", "Released": "11 Dec 1992", "Actors": "Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon", "Year": "1992", "Genre": "Drama, Thriller", "Awards": "Nominated for 4 Oscars.

Upon his return to work following a heart attack, irrepressible barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts, known as a barrister for the hopeless, takes on a murder case, much to the exasperation of his medical team, led by his overly regulated private nurse, Miss Plimsoll, who tries her hardest to ensure that he not return to his hard living ways - including excessive cigar smoking and drinking - while he takes his medication and gets his much needed rest. That case is defending American war veteran Leonard Vole, a poor, out of work, struggling inventor who is accused of murdering his fifty-six year old lonely and wealthy widowed acquaintance, Emily French. The initial evidence is circumstantial but points to Leonard as the murderer. Despite being happily married to East German former beer hall performer Christine Vole, he fostered that friendship with Mrs. French in the hopes that she would finance one of his many inventions to the tune of a few hundred pounds. It thus does not help his case when it is learned that Mrs. French changed her will prior to her murder with Leonard being the primary beneficiary of a \u00a380,000 estate. Leonard states that he knew nothing about the will. Christine is apparently the only alibi Leonard has to his whereabouts at the time of the murder. The usual methods Sir Wilfrid uses to test his clients' guilt or innocence leads to him believing that Leonard is indeed innocent. As the trial progresses, the prosecution calls a surprise witness, one that could place a nail in the coffin of Sir Wilfrid's planned line of defense. As Sir Wilfrid gets deeper and deeper into the case, something doesn't quite sit right with him, although he doesn't know what it is. The primary questions become how far Sir Wilfrid will go to obtain evidence to acquit Leonard, and if he will ever discover why he feels that there is something odd about the case.", "Rated": "APPROVED", "Response": "True", "Language": "English, German", "Title": "Witness for the Prosecution", "Country": "USA", "Writer": "Agatha Christie (in Agatha Christie's international stage success), Billy Wilder (screen play), Harry Kurnitz (screen play), Lawrence B.

A company called Zomcon has been able to control the zombie population. Zombies can be temporarily neutralized by being shot, but can only be permanently neutralized by their brain being destroyed. Their ultimate disposal is through cremation, or burial, the latter which requires decapitation with the head being buried separately from the body. Conversely, Zomcon has created the domestication collar, when activated and placed on a zombie makes the zombie controllable and thus an eternally productive creature within society. Because all dead initially become zombies, the elderly are viewed negatively and suspectly. And all people, adult or child, learn to shoot to kill to protect society. Zomcon is the go to organization for all things zombie. In the town of Willard, the Robinsons - father Bill, mother Helen, and adolescent son Timmy - are one family who don't own a zombie as a domestic since Bill is afraid of zombies, as, when he was a child, he had to shoot his own zombie father, who tried to eat him. Bill has thus become fascinated with funerals to see zombies put away permanently. But Helen feels pressured to get a zombie when Zomcon's new head of security in Willard, the officious Jonathan Bottoms, moves into the neighborhood with his family. Never having had to deal with a zombie directly, Timmy is initially wary of their zombie. But as a lonely child who has no friends and is often bullied, Timmy eventually befriends their zombie, who he names Fido, as he treats the zombie much like a faithful pet dog. Timmy protects Fido at all cost, even after Fido, due to no fault of its own, is implicated in some deaths, which creates a mini-wave of loose zombies unknown to Zomcon. But Fido may play a larger role within the family as a companion for Helen, who is largely neglected by Bill, since he sees human affection as ultimately resulting in such difficult issues as what happened between him and his own father. With Timmy and Helen treating Fido with kindness, Fido, in turn, may prove that not all zombies, even when without their domestication collar, are out to kill anyone and everyone in their path.", "Rated": "R", "Response": "True", "Language": "English", "Title": "Fido", "Country": "Canada", "Writer": "Robert Chomiak, Andrew Currie, Dennis Heaton, Dennis Heaton (original story)", "Metascore": "70", "imdbRating": "6.8", "Director": "Andrew Currie", "Released": "16 Mar 2007", "Actors": "David Kaye, Jan Skorzewski, Kevin Tyell, Andy Parkin", "Year": "2006", "Genre": "Comedy, Drama, Horror", "Awards": "13 wins & 15 nominations.", "Runtime": "93 min", "Type": "movie", "Poster": "http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzNjQ4OTYxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY5MDEwNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "imdbVotes": "23,528", "imdbID": "tt0457572"}, {"Plot": "Single father Dan Burns dedicates his life to his children, but one day he meets Marie at a bookstore.
