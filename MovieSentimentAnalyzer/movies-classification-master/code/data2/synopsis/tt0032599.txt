A newspaper editor played by Cary Grant meets his ex-wife/ex-star reporter's fiancee the day before they are set to be married. She says she will be happy to live a life where she will be treated like a real woman, not a newsman. Grant spends the rest of the movie, which all takes place in one day, trying to lure Hildy back into the life they shared. Most of the movie takes place in the press room of a police station.
