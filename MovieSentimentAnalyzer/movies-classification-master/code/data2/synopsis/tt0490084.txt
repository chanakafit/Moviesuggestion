Daphne (Diane Keaton), a single mother with three grown daughters, becomes overly concerned and almost obsessed over her youngest daughter's, Milly (Mandy Moore), love life, after Milly's latest boyfriend dumps her. Afraid that Milly seems unable to find a good man on her own, Daphne places an ad in the personals to find her a man and engineer a chance meeting. The plan seems foolproof until Milly meets someone on her own, who turns out to be a candidate that Mom had already rejected. Daphne has her own handsome, successful choice for her daughter and tries to keep Milly from spending time with this other man. In the course of all her scheming and planning, Daphne finds someone who just might take her mind off her daughters for a while.
