Cousins Bo (Seann William Scott), Luke (Johnny Knoxville), and Daisy Duke (Jessica Simpson) have returned with the General Lee (1969 Dodge Charger) to the big screen. Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson) is still making the best moonshine in Hazzard County, Georgia, with Bo and Luke making deliveries. Sheriff Roscoe P. Coltrane (M.C. Gainey) is still trying to catch Bo and Luke running moonshine in the General Lee. Bo and Luke discover that the crooked county commissioner, Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds) has illegally been taking their neighbors land, and the Dukes family farm is next. The Dukes have a plan to save their farm and the town of Hazzard from becoming a coal strip-mine. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)
