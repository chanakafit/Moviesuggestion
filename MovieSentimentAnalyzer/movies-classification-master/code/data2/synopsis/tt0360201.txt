Peter is about to retire from the tennis circuit, when he is granted a wild card to play in his final Wimbledon tournament. He meets the American tennis star Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst) at the hotel. They meet again on the tennis practice court and make a date. Peter is losing his first match when he sees Lizzie in the stands. Her presents inspire him to win his first match. Lizzie easily wins her first match, and they begin to have an affair during the tournament.
