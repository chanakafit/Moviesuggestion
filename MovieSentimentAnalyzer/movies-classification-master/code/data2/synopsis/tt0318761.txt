Justin is a semi-nerdy teenager who still sucks his thumb, is in love with a classmate, and feeling uneasy. His dentist hypnotizes him for his thumbsucking habit, then he's diagnosed with attention disorder. After taking a prescribed drug, he becomes focused, clear, and aware, thinks fast, reads insatiably, wins debate tournaments, ...and thinks he knows everything, advising his parents on their lives, etc.About awareness, power, and maturity, in the form of a fable. Vincent d'Onofrio and Tilda Swinton are good as the parents, and Lou Taylor Pucci (playing Justin) does a great job.
