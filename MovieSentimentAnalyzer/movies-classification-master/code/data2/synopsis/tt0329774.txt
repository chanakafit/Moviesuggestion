Unknown assassins penetrate a secret National Security Agency underground facility in Virginia, and kill 16 NSA agents. Agent Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) escapes, and must find out who broke security and why. Gibbons must recruit a new XXX agent to do his dirty work. Gibbons has just the man, a former Navy Seal and member of his old military unit. However, Darius Stone (Ice Cube) was put in a military prison for 20 years, because he disobeyed a direct order from General George Deckert (Willem Dafoe), and he also broke the general's jaw. Just the man Gibbons needs to do the job. Gibbons gets Stone out of prison, and puts him to work. Stone discovers that Deckert, who is now the secretary of defense, is the mastermind of a conspiracy to stage a coup, and become President of the United States. Deckert has been training and placing his old military unit in the right places to stage his coup. Deckert wants the President killed and anybody above him in the line of secession.
