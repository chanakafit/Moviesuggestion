Daniel Hillard is doing voices for a cat and mouse cartoon (similar to Tom and Jerry), and has objections to the mouse smoking a cigarette. He says it teaches kids that it's cool to smoke and he will not do it. The producers tell him to either follow the script or lose his job. Daniel chooses to quit, and walks out.
