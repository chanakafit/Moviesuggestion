Sellers plays Hrundi V. Bakshi a bumbling, yet lovable actor from India who tries endlessly to cope with the high-tech, high society around him from 1960's Hollywood and yet makes a shambles of everything.The movie defines and is defined by the 1960's, as Blake Edwards uses every gimmick from the drunken server to pot-smoking musicians to set the mood. Bakshi continues about the party where he is mistakenly found, and explores the gadgets and gimmicks while making friends with several wonderful (albeit stereotyped) characters.Notably, he alienates the director from his earlier acting attempt when he rescues a lady from the director's unwanted amorous approaches. Our unsung hero also makes allies with the children and the household pets while continuing to &quot;tear down the house.&quot;The film starts slowly, almost yawningly, but bulids towards the climax at the end with the following ingredients: Soap, Russians, a swimming pool and an elephant. Throw in a little peace, love and plenty of booze and you get the picture!A riotous film, one of my all time favorites. It brought Sellers and Edwards together for their best (IMHO) collaboration.PS watch out for the classic 3 wheeler Morgan sports car at the end - fits Peter Sellers' persona perfectly.
