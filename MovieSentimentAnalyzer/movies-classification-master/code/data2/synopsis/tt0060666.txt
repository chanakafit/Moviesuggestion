A man and woman and their daughter, while driving across West Texas in search of a vacation lodge, stumble upon a remote house occupied by a sinister &quot;Master,&quot; his servant &quot;Torgo,&quot; and the Master's several wives (it is revealed that all are worshippers of a mysterious deity known as &quot;Manos,&quot; and yes they are practitioners of human sacrifice). Predictably, the family of travelers find their lives endangered, although Torgo secretly promises to assist them. When the Master discovers Torgo's betrayal, he amputates one of Torgo's hands, and Torgo flees into the night. Thereafter, the Master confronts the family of travelers and works his &quot;hypnotic&quot; magic on them: The father then replaces Torgo as the Master's servant, and the mother and daughter become the Master's latest &quot;brides&quot;... The End?
