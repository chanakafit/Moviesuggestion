when a new kid by the name of chase collins, tranfers into the elite Spencer Accademy, 4 boys get suspious. the four boys are what people call the sons of ipswitch. they were 4 of the origional 5 families to coloinize ipswitch. the 5th, is said to have been killed during the salem witch hunts. when the 4 boys, caleb, pogue, reid and, tyler, befriend chase, weird things start to happen. it turns out that chase is a desentant of the 5th blood line, and &quot;one of them&quot;. we find out that the reason that chase is here, it to get the other members of the covenant's powers. by having them &quot;will it&quot; to him. on caleb's birthday, caleb and chase get into a fight to the death. caleb ends up killing chase (or so we think). chase gets thrown into a fire and his body is never found, so the boys assume that he is dead, saving himself, the covenant, and all of their loved ones.
