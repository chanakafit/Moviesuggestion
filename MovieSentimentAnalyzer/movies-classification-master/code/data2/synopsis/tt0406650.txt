Dean's best friend Troy is the point where it all starts. He has connections to happy pills. But when Troy kills himself, bored with the meaninglessness of life in a materialistic, completely fabricated California suburb, his usual buyers don't stop wanting the drugs.The school bullies (who don't really know what they're doing) kidnap a kid, thinking it's Dean's younger brother, in an attempt to convince Dean to hand over the last of Troy's stash. But they kidnap the wrong kid. The child, who rather enjoys the goofiness of the stupid bullies, is the son of the town sheriff who is recently divorced from an interior designer who is remarrying the very strange mayor of the town. But she's so concerned about making sure her wedding day goes off without a hitch, she doesn't even notice Charlie is missing for a full day.Everything comes together at a crashing climax on the Sunday of the designer's wedding which coincides with Troy's memorial service.
