This is a comedy that includes a heck of a lot of other movies and seeks to rip them
off in the most rediculious and hilariously over the top waysNick Rivers is a '50's rock 'n roll heart throb, young, dumb and full of fun. He's Elvis, The
Beach Boys, The Big Bopper, Buddy Holly and any other rocker from that period you can
think of.He goes on tour in Germany, featuring in the musical festival there, but is unaware that
evil Nazi's are only using this as a cover to disguise their true dream of world domination.
And they use this festive bit to draw the attention of the other countries away from this fact.Nick gets involved with a pretty young woman, Hilary. She is infact part of the French Resistance and part of a very oddly and obviously named crew of French freedom
fighters. Including Chocolate Mouse and many others.He gets into a heap of trouble, lands up in jail and then escapes in a very slap stick
sort of way.Will his heart be broken by Hilary when her ex, Nigel, who she spent time on an island
with as a child and then felt stricken when he vanished, comes back into her life with an oiled six pack and a loin cloth?And will he decide to help the resistance with a couple of tunes and moving of his pelvis? Save the day in a manner that is completely side splitting? Win the love
of Hilary and still sing Tuttie Fruttie?
