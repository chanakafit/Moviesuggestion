President Staton (Dennis Quaid) hasn't looked at a newspaper since he was elected to office. Then on the morning after his re-election, he decides to read the newspaper. He locks himself in his bedroom for several weeks, and begins to examine his view of the world. Vice President Sutter (Willem Dafoe) believes the President is having a nervous breakdown. To snap the President out of it, the Vice President gives him happy pills and books him as a guest judge on the American Dreamz television show. The weekly talent show contest is hosted by America's most hated/loved judge, Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant). The show makes celebrities out of everybody who makes it to the finals. Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore) and Omer (Sam Golzari) make it to the final round where the President will be judging with Martin. Get ready for all the fireworks, because this show will be seen by millions of people and be the highest rated show in the country. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)
