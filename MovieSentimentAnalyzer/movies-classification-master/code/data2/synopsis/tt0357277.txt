The storyline is based on a character from the Marvel Comics. Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) is killed and brought back to life by Stick (Terence Stamp), a blind martial arts master. Stick trains Elektra in the martial art of ninjitsu, and after several years of intense training, she becomes his best student. Stick sends Elektra on her own, and she becomes a hired assassin. Elektra dresses in all red and only uses her martial arts when she goes after a target. Elektra is so skilled as an assassin that nobody can stop her from her assignment, no matter how many bodyguards with guns you have around you. The Order of the Hand, a ninja collective of assassins, is looking for Mark Miller (Goran Visnjic) and his daughter Abby (Kirsten Prout). In the meantime, Elektra receives a contract for $2 million to kill Mark and Abby. Elektra goes to a small island for a few days and gets to know Mark and Abby before she finds out that they are her targets. Elektra must make a choice between good or evil in carrying out her deadly mission. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)
