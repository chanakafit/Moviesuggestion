Mike Myers stars in the title role as the mischievous feline with the red-and-white striped magical stovepipe hat, a film adaptation of the beloved Dr. Seuss book, `The Cat in the Hat'. The Cat stirs up mischief wherever he goes, especially for Conrad and Sally Walden, (Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning) two children who are home alone with their pet fish. With nothing to do, Conrad begins to mess-up the house by riding a board down the stairs. Their single mom (Kelly Preston) is having the company party that night, and the house must be neat and clean or her germ-o-phobic boss will fire her. She orders the children not to take one step into the living room. Of course, when the Cat arrives, he is part of a wrecking crew that destroys the house. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)
