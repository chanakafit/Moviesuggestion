This is a tale of 'angst' based in 'hicks'ville America with many resident colourful and amusing characters.In essence, a girl-meets-boy story, or rather disillusioned and cynical girl meets socially inept man - a sort of coming of age tale - where the main protagonist - Enid - finds actions have consequences!A refreshingly, (for once) non-lefty story of a teenager's voyage into adulthood and the inevitable emotional/relationship mishaps that occur on the way.A dark story indeed, but nonetheless very much on the nail!!!
