Frank Morris(Clint Eastwood) is a cunning bank robber who determines to be the first to escape from Alcatraz prison which is supposedly escape-proof. He arrives at Alcatraz on a rainy night, gets locked in his cell naked, and told, &quot;Welcome to Alcatraz&quot;. The next morning at breakfast, he sits across from Litmus(Frank Ronzio), and quickly befriends him. At his interview with the warden(Patrick McGoohan), he's told that no one escapes from Alcatraz. After Frank leaves his office, the warden notices on his report that Frank's IQ is superior. Frank then reports for his first job at the library, and meets his new boss, English(Paul Benjamin). They exchange insults and racial slurs, which are prevalent throughout the film. There is also a lot of prison slang, of course. Frank gets in a fight with another inmate, Wolf(Bruce M. Fischer), in the showers one day. Eventually, he meets up with two brothers and shares his plan for escape with them. They agree to participate. The movie climaxes with the escape attempt, and goes into detail as to how they did it.
