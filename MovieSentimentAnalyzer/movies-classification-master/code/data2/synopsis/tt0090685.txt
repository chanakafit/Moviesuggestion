Rodney Dangerfield plays Thornton Melon, a mega rich retail magnate who decides to drop everything and go to university to show support for his son, played by Keith Gordon. Along the way, he rubs a business professor the wrong way, tries to rub a sexy literature professor (Sally Kellerman) the right way and meets a post traumatically stressed history instructor played by the late and loud Sam Kinison. When he is not pursuing a higher education, he is encouraging his son to follow in his footsteps as a competitive diver and making a few changes to the party lifestyle at the college.
