'Religulous' is a 2008 American documentary film directed by Larry Charles and starring political comedian Bill Maher. According to Maher, the title of the film is a portmanteau derived from the words &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;ridiculous,&quot; implying the satirical nature of the documentary that is meant to mock the concept of religion and the problems it brings about.
