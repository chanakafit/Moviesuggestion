This is the third movie of this series. The premise of the movie is one that Alexa Vega (Carmen Cortez) is caught in a virtual reality game and Daryl Sabara (Juni Cortez) her brother must get her out. The spy kids go into this video game to fight the Toymaker played by Sylvester Stallone. If you remember the movie `Tron', you will see about the same thing in this one. The characters in the game have a certain number of lives, and they must fight to get to the fifth level to win. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)
