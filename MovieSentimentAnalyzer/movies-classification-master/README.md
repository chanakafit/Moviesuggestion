# Movies Classification

Project made for the MLBD (Machine Learning on Big Data) lecture of the MSE Master.

### Goal

Use unsupervised learning algorithms to classify movies. We used Self-Organizing Maps (Kohonen) to do this.

### Data

The sysnopsis of different movies were fetched from the IMDb website. The classification is based on the occurrence of the relevant words in each synopsis.

### Python libraries used

- requests : for HTTP requests
- BeautifulSoup : for HTML parsing
- json : to store and format datas
- numpy : for matrices computation
- nltk : to remove the stopwords
- re : to extract words from the texts
- kohonen : unsupervised learning algorithms
- hcluster : for hierarchical clustering and visualization
- matplotlib : for visualization

### Keywords

Self-Organizing Maps, SOM, Kohonen, U-matrix, machine learning, TF-IDF, Python, clustering, classification, neural network.
