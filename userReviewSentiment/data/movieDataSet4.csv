LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts where he studied Drama.Personal Quotes (21)      I\'m one with New York and New York is one with me. I grew up there; there\'s no escaping it. We\'re like Siamese twins, if you separate us, I\'ll die.      Certainly, if it had been anything other than an HBO show I\'d probably still be in Mexico now with a Mexican wife and kids.      Celebrities become divas because they get pampered so much, babied so much - then they get used to it.      Being performers, that\'s what we do: We put on shows and want people to watch.      My only ambition when I came to Hollywood was to pay my rent.      It\'s enough to indulge and to be selfish but true happiness is really when you start giving back.      I was rebellious.      I want to show people that environmentalism can be fun!      I think, in a lot of ways, celebrities represent the American dream. They have financial fluidity and options at their disposal.      I have always chosen roles that I believed in - not ones that I thought might further my career.      I don\'t shop. I haven\'t shopped in about four years.      You ask any actor - they\'ll tell you they\'d rather shoot on location because you don\'t have to invent the energy, the energy is there.      What is important is family, friends, giving back to your community and finding meaning in life.      Tabloids can be fun. I see stuff sometimes and have a good laugh.      Secondly, love and relationships are complicated. No one could ever get it right in a four-line sentence.      Once you get into the habit of work, you can be more productive in the things you want to do.      Well, obviously I\'m not Mark Wahlberg - I have much better abs and I look much better in a pair of Calvin Kleins but when I saw Mark Wahlberg interacting with the world, I realised that his stardom was sort of a result of the movies he had done and the publicity that he had got and the work that he did.      I think winter wear is communal. You get some gloves and a scarf from a lost-and-found box, wash them, wear them for a while until you lose them. Then somebody else does the same thing.      I think anybody who\'s famous has to deal with their fame in their own way, and I dealt with it by making a film about a kid who\'s looking out into the world of celebrity obsession.      I have a bunch of concepts and ideas that I want to do but I have also been growing my production company in general and looking to branch out of projects that I am directing and producing.      Because when you go out, and you have fun, basically you\'re performing for these tabloid outlets and the paparazzi. And when you perform and create this story, they\'re chuffed - they get excited, they capture it, and they put it out.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nSarah Michelle Gellar ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 165 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(2)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(91)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(61)\xa0|Salary\xa0(6)  Overview (3)Date of Birth14\xa0April1977,\xa0New York City, New York, USA NicknamesSassySMG    Height5\'\xa04""\xa0(1.63\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Emmy Award-winning Sarah Michelle Gellar was born on April 14, 1977 in New York City, the daughter of Rosellen (Greenfield), who taught at a nursery school, and Arthur Gellar, who worked in the garment industry.

I don\'t have a father. I would never give him the credit or acknowledge him as my father.      [on being a teen idol] This is what I\'ve waited for my whole life.      [High school] My biggest complaint is school when it\'s Send-the-roses day. Somebody\'s always left out. I always got roses, but I would give them to someone who hadn\'t gotten any.      [Horror Movies] I\'m always the one who gets killed. And I want it to be really gory. Body parts all over the place. Mangled!      [on Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon]: ""They\'re unbelievable. They\'re an inspiration to young love.""      [on job pressures] There\'s so much pressure on all of us right now. On Katie Holmes, on James Van Der Beek and myself, to do these movies, and do as much as you can because there is the slight feeling that one day your phone will stop ringing. It\'s not about the craft, per se. It\'s so easy to fall for it all because people remind you constantly that as fast as it comes, it can go. And I think there is this sort of paranoia, this need to keep working. And I know that I felt it, and for the first three years of the show, I never had more than a week off, except for Christmas. That was it.      [on being \'skinny\'] How can women be as thin as we are? We have personal trainers to work us out. We have specially prepared meals.      [on the Internet] I got a computer and I\'m learning how to use it. I collect antique books, so I used it to get my copy of \'Les Liaisons Dangereuses,\' and I use it for travel, to look up customs. I went to Fiji, and I looked up all this stuff before I went, like \'Don\'t wear a hat in someone\'s house because it\'s rude, and don\'t wear shoes.\' You\'ve got to think there\'s something better I can do with my time than log on to the Internet and say, \'Ooo, let\'s find out about me!\' I think that would frighten me a little bit.      [on what the word ""feminist"" means] I don\'t call myself a feminist because feminism has a negative connotation. It makes you think of women who don\'t shave their legs. But feminism is not just about not being weak. It\'s about being able to take care of yourself. Just because you might care about what you look like or what the opposite sex thinks of you, it doesn\'t make you not a feminist, although it\'s a word I hate. Do I consider myself a strong female individual? Uh-huh. Can I take care of myself? Yes.      [on her kissing scene with Selma Blair in Cruel Intentions (1999)] It was a great kiss. It even had a saliva trail.      One of the greatest gifts my job has given me is that my mother, who gave up her entire life for me, doesn\'t have to work any more. I\'m now in a position to repay her for her devotion.      I am militant about drugs. You want to do \'em? You\'re out of my life.      [on posing nude] Right now I can\'t picture posing, but I don\'t believe in saying never... There might be a time when I got pregnant and felt really beautiful and wanted to have a nude picture.      [on what she would do if she wasn\'t acting] I would go to college to be a journalist. I always wanted to write for Time or Newsweek.      You\'ll never know what you\'re capable of if you don\'t try.      I don\'t understand why James Bond has to be a man all the time. When Pierce Brosnan retires, why not one of us?      [on why she was happy to get married:] I\'m so grateful I don\'t have to go looking for a man on a Saturday night. I was always terrible at chatting up men. [December 10, 2003]      [about Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997)] To me, the scariest elements of horror films are the things that could really happen. And what is more scary than high school? ... What I like about the show is that it reminds you it\'s O.K. to be different. What people think isn\'t necessarily true. If people walk away with half of that, we\'ve done our job. [New York Times, April 27, 1997]      [on playing Kendall Hart on All My Children (1970)] I seduced my stepfather, and when he wouldn\'t sleep with me, I slept with the stable boy, cried rape, and my mother stabbed him with a letter opener. Then I went to jail for perjury, burned my parents\' divorce papers, and locked up my little sister. I think that was all in the first week. [New York Times, April 27, 1997]      [on attending the Professional Children\'s High School in Manhattan] Everybody there had a talent, and everyone was respected. If somebody didn\'t like you -- they didn\'t talk to you! They didn\'t make fun of you, punish you. You could, you know, mess around with how you dress. You really had that chance to find yourself, and I thank God for that school. I went to that school feeling amazingly untalented. That school was my lifeline. Let me tell you something -- talent night at our school? There was nothing like it.      Horror films are where women can shine and have a chance to lead. They always save the day in these films.      [on gay marriage] I have good friends, gay couples, who\'ve been together for 18 years. It drives me crazy that in the eyes of the law, their love isn\'t acknowledged when I have girlfriends who have married four times by the age of 25.      [on religion] I don\'t believe in organized religion and I never have.      No, that\'s what bothers me. That\'s how they think. Okay, this is a summer...I remember that it used to be you could see great movies any time. Now it\'s like summer is for blockbusters, fall is for the movies that they can\'t fit into any other time, that\'s like September. Then Oscar movies start, it used to be post Thanksgiving. Now the awards are earlier so it starts earlier. January is when they dump movies. And it\'s just so... it seems to me so obvious that wouldn\'t it be better for the marketplace to have these movies spread out? Not just people don\'t only go to the movies in summer time. If that was the truth, then in the summer time they would count the whole week\'s worth of the box office but it\'s still only a weekend. So why does it matter...sorry, I get a little upset. It\'s just frustrating.      Basically I only like to choose films that I don\'t understand. As long as they\'re greater than my mental capacity, I figure I gotta be doing something artful, right? Isn\'t that what makes something art when you don\'t understand it?      I wish, and I wish so much for the film industry right now. I wish so much for originality and I wish so much and I think that we\'re caught in this difficult cycle right now because our studios are corporations now. I keep talking about the old 1940s, where one guy with a cigar and a scotch made decisions for a studio and now, because there are all these computer corporations basically, technology companies and there\'s so much else that goes into a decision that it\'s very difficult to get films that are different, that are off the beaten path, made. It\'s much easier to get something unoriginal made than to get something original.      ""Simply Irresistible (1999) was just a bad choice - and for that it was a great learning experience. I wasn\'t ready to make that movie. I was too young. The script was not ready. I knew in my heart before I left to make it that I should back out"".      [on how she would like Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997) and her work on it to be remembered] I hope positively. One thing about the show was it was never categorized. It was drama, comedy, action, horror, all of those things combined. And I just want people to remember it as a fabulous run, a fabulous seven years.      In this day and age, everything is so cross-marketed that the lines have blurred, in my opinion, between what is an actor and what is a celebrity. What is reality? All you have to do is pick up a magazine or turn on the television and you can get ideas from places that five years ago you couldn\'t.      [Working in LA filming Southland Tales (2006)] That\'s so weird. It\'s one of those things that\'s like you go on location and you\'re there for a week getting ready. Here it\'s like you\'re walking the dog, you\'re paying the bills and then 10 minutes later, you have to go to work. It\'s a very sort of odd- - I\'m grateful for it and so glad to actually film a movie in Hollywood. Although some of these locations are pretty far. I could probably fly to some of them.      [on her doing movies and Freddie Prinze Jr. doing his show] It\'s funny in the sense of he\'ll say to me, \'You don\'t understand. You\'re doing a movie. I\'ve been on my feet all day.\' I\'m like, \'For real? For real I don\'t understand?\' So that\'s kind of odd. And the times are funny because I\'m on nights and he\'s more organized in terms of...or last week he was getting out of the house at like 3:30 in the morning.      [Her advice for her husband, Freddie Prinze Jr. on his sitcom Freddie (2005)] Do a sitcom. Don\'t do a one hour. That was actually my advice. He was going to do a one hour. I was like, \'Are you crazy? You know what people make for sitcoms and how little they work, right? You see all of our friends on sitcoms.      You know what? I only see myself doing films that interest me and that are a little bit off the beaten path. I will go wherever that takes me. I just - - I always say it just can\'t be generic. I can\'t be the girlfriend or the wife or the - - you can\'t play the characters that I\'ve been blessed to play and then do that. I can\'t be the girl in the film.      I think the best piece of advice I\'ve ever gotten is to trust myself and go for my dreams. I got that from my mom.      Being sexy is being confident. It\'s important to know you don\'t have to have silicone breasts falling out and a thigh-high skirt. Sometimes you meet people and they think, \'Another cute little blonde actress.\' That\'s not who I am. - on rather being known as clever than sexy.      [on not wanting children at this point] You can\'t be selfish and have a child. Right now I want to live my life and have fun. I want to go sit in my Jacuzzi and drink wine all night. [December 2007]      I had to twist his [Freddie\'s] arm and leg to see Moulin Rouge! (2001) Although he enjoyed it once we were there. In fact, there was a moment during the evening when I swear I thought he was going to leave me for Nicole Kidman but then, who could blame him? I\'d probably leave him for Nicole if she asked. She\'s hot!      It sounds clichéd, but when women turn 30 they find themselves. You become more comfortable in your own skin. Last night on Letterman I wore this skintight Herve Ledger dress. Two years ago, three years ago? I would never have worn it. - Gothman Magazine.      [on her character Buffy Summers] For eight years I had the pleasure of portraying a character that was the very definition of a powerful woman. In my opinion, one of the greatest examples in the history of entertainment. [2007]      As an actor, you constantly play these other characters. You\'re always pretending to be somebody else, but at the same time you have to keep a handle on who you are. I think that\'s where a lot of actresses get lost sometimes, because that\'s tough. I can only imagine it has to be the same as a pop star because you\'re not even playing a character. You\'re a persona.      [After having her baby girl Charlotte] I\'m not going back to work anytime soon. I\'ll only have my first child once and see these milestones once. I can\'t imagine not being there. We\'re (she and husband Freddie Prinze Jr.) just taking it one day at a time. I\'m such a cliché right now, but she is the greatest gift that anyone has ever given me, and I will spend the rest of my life doing everything I can to do right by her. What still overwhelms me is the reality that we created this life together, and now we are responsible for her. She is here; she is ours. I\'d say that makes us pretty lucky, indeed. [November 2009]      [on the suggestion of a \'Buffy\' film, 2004] \'My concern with a film is, how can we do it justice? We went out on top, and I like staying there. That doesn\'t mean I won\'t change my mind. I\'m a woman. It\'s my prerogative to change my mind as often as I like!\'      [on working with Seth Green] \'If I had my way, I\'d work with Seth on every project. I think the world of him...he\'s an amazingly gifted comedian and he\'s also a very giving comedian.\'      [on a possible Buffy reboot movie] It was a movie! It\'s been made. It stars Kristy Swanson, they made it! They don\'t need to make another one. I think it\'s a horrible idea to try to do a Buffy without Joss Whedon, I mean that\'s like honestly...to be incredibly non-eloquent, that\'s the dumbest idea I ever heard.      [on the importance of reading] I love books. I\'m constantly afraid we\'re moving into this digital era where books are going to go away, and to me books are the basis to everything in life. Reading is how we function. It\'s not just creative imagination and creative play, it\'s how we function as human beings, as human adults, and if you can instill that at a young age then that\'s a skill they\'ll have for life.      [looking back on Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997)] I think it\'s gotten me to this point now where I don\'t have this burning desire to accomplish anything. That was so fulfilling for me in every way that everything I do now is the cherry on top. I don\'t feel the pressure to do this or have to do this or go here or do that because I feel like I\'ve already won.      [on enjoying working, but not letting it take over her life] I was 18 years old when I started ""Buffy,"" and work was my everything. Back then, no actor had worse hours than I did. Now I don\'t work on weekends anymore. Everybody knows you can\'t sway me on that point, so nobody even tries. Plus, my perspective on work has changed: Work doesn\'t define who I am. I love what I do, but I don\'t feel a burning pressure anymore. And because I\'m working for fun, I get to enjoy it. I\'d watch Ringer (2011) if I wasn\'t on it! Of course, it\'s not as much fun when you know what\'s going to happen. It takes some of the excitement away.      [on how having a child has changed her perspective on work] I would never fault anyone\'s decisions and choices, but being a parent was so important to me. I just couldn\'t be the parent who goes from country to country and leaves their child, or schleps their child with them.      [on finding it difficult to understand people who view returning to TV after strictly working in film is a step down career-wise] I don\'t feel like I didn\'t succeed - The Grudge (2004) is still the second-highest female opening ever. And Ringer (2011) doesn\'t feel like a retrograde step, not to me. That is the weird perception, but I think it\'s slowly changing.      [on whether or not she is fed up with looking back and talking about Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997)] Fed up with it? No! No, no, no! I\'m so proud of it, and I actually like talking about it more now than I did then. Because I was 19, 20. Sometimes I think, to get true perspective, you have to step away, to realize the impact that something had.      [on how Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997) affected the course of television] ""Buffy"" came at the right time ... Now you see these great roles on television all the time. Glenn Close in Damages (2007)? One of the greatest actresses of all time. Sally Field in Brothers & Sisters (2006)? TV is where the roles are. Without wishing to sound obnoxious, I do think it changed the course of television. It certainly changed genre television. It just came at the right time for that.      I clip coupons all the time. Why should you pay more for something that someone else is paying less for?      Relationships are like flowers: They need attention to grow and develop. You have to make time to be there for the other person.      I kiss other girls, sure, but that doesn\'t make me a lesbian. Does it? I mean, I read \'\'Playgirl\'\'.      [on quitting Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997)] You always worry about being the show that\'s been on too long especially when you\'re a cult hit. Last year, a lot of people were ready to tear us down. So when we started to have such a strong year this year, I thought, \'\'This is how I want to go out on top, at our best.\'\' I was 18 when I started the show; I\'m 26. I\'m married. I never see my husband. This has been the longest span of my life in one place. There\'ve been times where that\'s been difficult, you want to pick up and go, try other things, live in different places. It feels right, and you have to listen to that. The show, as we know it, is over. I love this job, I love the fans. I love telling the stories we tell. This isn\'t about leaving for a career in movies, or in theater, it\'s more of a personal decision. I need a rest. Teachers get sabbaticals. Actors don\'t.      [on The Crazy Ones (2013)] James Wolk is a star. Like I said to Robin, \'Its great that you\'re Robin Williams and you\'re great and you\'re funny, but Jimmy Wolk is stealing this entire show from you. Like, watch out      [on being called Buffy] Back then, if you\'d called me Buffy I would probably have been really annoyed. Now, of course, I get it and I\'m appreciative of it. But that\'s something that comes with maturity, which most people don\'t have when they\'re 24 years old.      I\'ve definitely smoked cigarettes, and I\'ve partied plenty. I just got it out of my system early. I was lucky enough to have had my experiences when I was younger - and out of the public eye. When I was younger, I was very careful not to... I just didn\'t want to be seen with a drink in my hand. People looked up to Buffy, and she was a character that girls respected.      [on motherhood] For me, having a child was that cliched, life-altering experience where everything took on a different meaning. Things that had once been priorities had no meaning to me anymore, and things that I\'d never thought about suddenly became things that were on my mind. If I\'d known how happy having a child would make me, I probably would have had one a long time ago.      I got locked out of our new house a few days ago without any shoes on and ended up bloodying and scraping the bottom of my feet. I kind of scaled a wall thinking I was still a 22-year-old superhero.

Is a fan of country music and wrote the song she sings in Chasing Amy (1997).      Won the Chicago Film Critics ""Most Promising Actress"" award in 1997 for her performance in Chasing Amy (1997).      Moved to Hollywood in 1988.      Often mistaken for Renée Zellweger. During her appearance on Dinner for Five (2001) she said the person who most-often makes that mistake is Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein.      When her brother was in a coma from an automobile accident, he would only show a response from her very distinctive voice.      She has worked with both of the London twins. She starred in Dazed and Confused (1993) with Jason London and two years later in Mallrats (1995) with Jeremy London.      Good friend of Ashley Judd.      Moved after 19 years from Los Angeles to Oxford, Mississippi.

Coincidentally, Ben Affleck appeared in both films.      She appeared in four films with Ben Affleck: Dazed and Confused (1993), Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997) and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001). The first of these, which was directed by Richard Linklater, was the only one of the four not directed by Kevin Smith.Personal Quotes (19)      [on her distinctive voice] It\'s not a normal voice. It doesn\'t fit into people\'s preconceptions about what a woman\'s voice should sound like. My mom doesn\'t think I have an unusual voice, though. I\'m sure it\'s helped me get some roles. But Chasing Amy (1997), I almost didn\'t get. There was concern the voice would grate on some people -- which some critics said it did.      \'Chasing Amy\' was an amazing role, but then after that, I went and did \'Big Daddy\' and you\'re the girlfriend or you\'re the best friend. I wasn\'t getting the Nicole Kidman roles.      There were days that I literally had no reason to get out of bed. It just was so destructive for me.      The last person they expected to connect with a screenplay was the comedic, blonde actress with the funny voice.      It\'s not like you can wake up and realize, \'Oh, I want intimacy,\' and then it happens that day.      I was never one of those people who thought, \'What I really want to do is direct.\' It never occurred to me.      I think, ultimately, looking back now, acting wasn\'t satisfying me 100%.      I like decorative, functional things that I feel comfortable in.      I am one of the few actresses who isn\'t recognized by the way she looks. I\'m recognized by the way I talk.      For women in their 30s, it\'s so hard to get good parts.      Definition of an independent film is torture with less money and time.      A bonus: You don\'t have to diet to direct.      My relationship with my father is pretty non-existent.      I don\'t think I was fully satisfied acting. You know, the girlfriend role or the best friend role, and that wasn\'t enough for me.      A genius is one who can do anything except make a living.      I want to feel passion, I want to feel pain. I want to weep at the sound of your name. Come make me laugh, come make me cry... just make me feel alive.      No one was jumping up and saying, \'Yeah, let me give you money.\' I had never held a camera in my hand - a home video camera, nothing. I had not directed.      My life isn\'t that dramatic. My dad really loves me, he just can\'t talk on the phone. He\'s too crippled and shy, and that\'s almost harder. He\'s there and he loves me, and I try and try and try, it\'s just impossible to have a relationship.      It just gets frustrating playing the girlfriend, It\'s just this awful feeling, sitting in your house, waiting for a script to come.

He was cast as Marty McFly in Back to the Future (1985) after Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale were unable to get Michael J. Fox, their first choice for the part due to scheduling conflicts. After only five weeks of filming, he was let go from the film because Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale felt he was ""too intense"" for the character. Michael J.

According to a 1992 Movieline Interview, the casting agents for Mask (1985) had refused to let him in to read for the part. When he had finally finagled his way into an audition via a sympathetic receptionist, he arrived for his big chance before the casting people wearing a stocking over his face. And he got the part. Now he really put the technique to work. Reportedly he also insisted on being called Rocky, never Eric. But he went further than that. ""I walked around town with the mask on. It was important to get people\'s reactions in grocery stores and post offices and see what they would say when they saw me strolling down the street. I just wanted to get an idea of how Rocky may have felt, which was horrible. People were generally cruel and mean. They would make snide comments. Kids threw things at me. People took pictures and asked, \'Hey, are you in the circus?\'"".

It\'s kind of strange, but not unpleasant.      I\'m interested in doing movies I wouldn\'t normally be interested in doing.      I realize I\'m a very lucky man. I love what I do, I love films, tv and theater, and the fact that I\'m able to make a living at it staggers me.      There\'s a strange sense of accomplishment in making an independent film. Everything\'s against you; there\'s no time, and even less money- you bring a bottle of glue, chip in twenty bucks, and hope you all make it through the day. If you manage to finish it and it actually turns out to be pretty good, it\'s thrilling.      I find that there are two kinds of actors (or actresses) that you work with constantly: (1) The Respectful Actor. This person is kind and giving and talented and fun to work with and respectful of your relationship. (2) The Predatory Actor. This person is kind and giving and talented and fun to work with but feels that because they are famous they don\'t have to function within society\'s rules, i.e., if they are hungry, they eat; if they are attracted to their co-star, they act on it, married or not, no matter what destruction may ensue. These people obviously should be in therapy.      To go from trying to steer a scene to trying to bring it to life from within is a big difference. Directing has only increased my admiration and respect for what it is that actors do. (On going from directing to acting on \'Grey\'s Anatomy\'.)      (1992, on Memphis Belle (1990)) Michael Caton-Jones was a little twisted. He had us spend three weeks running five miles a day with packs on our back and sleeping with 20 other smelly, grumpy guys. I think he wanted to see spoiled Hollywood actors tortured and beaten down so he could come in and direct. After boot camp we were putty in his hands. He wore a general\'s cap on the set and occasionally walked around with a riding crop. He\'s a good director, but his sense of humor is obviously strange.      (1992, on Haunted Summer (1988)) Actually, Laura Dern got me that role. She brought me the script and told me that I should meet the director. Ivan Passer took us to dinner and offered me the role. Some directors just want to hire you after getting a sense of who you are and others want you to read a million times. Either way is fine with me. Although it\'s a lot more fun to just go out to dinner...We lived this sort of bohemian existence during that film. We thought of those people as the rock and roll stars of their day, young, hedonistic people pursuing anarchic lifestyles, shocking society. We were all passionate about it. I already had a knowledge of the Romantic poets, but I didn\'t know much about (my character) Shelley. So I read every book about his life. I read this man\'s mail. I went to the places he went. I had a great time. I remember one night on Lake Como when there was an incredible thunderstorm. All the power went out in our hotel. I went out on the balcony and saw Laura and Philip Anglim on a balcony, and Alex Winter on the balcony next to them, watching the lightning. And I thought, this was what life should be like.      (1992, on his preparation for The Wild Life (1984)) I got a job at a bowling alley, moved into Oakwood Apartments in Burbank and tried to live that life. It was awful. I had to clean other people\'s shoes, deal with women\'s bowling day. The time really dragged. On one level, it was no fun at all but, on another level, it was real interesting. I had the opportunity to hang out in the apartment complex\'s clubhouse and down by the pool. The place was filled with recently divorced people who were licking their wounds. I did that for two months. And, ultimately, it did make it easier to do the character.      (1992, on his early love with Ally Sheedy. Source: Movieline) We met in history class. Neither of us were acting [in films] at the time. We were just kids in college. We lived together in a commune on Hollywood Boulevard. It was a huge old Victorian house called the Harris Hollywood House, and there were four or five rooms filled with ex-patriots from England, a handful of homeless people, lots of young, aspiring actors. It was cheap and the atmosphere was exciting. It was a wonderful, messy, fervent time filled with crazy people starting their careers and very excited about what might happen. (http://movieline.com/1992/06/01/eric-stoltz-true-confessions-of-a-faux-paraplegic/)      (1992) My parents moved to American Samoa when I was three or four years old. My dad was principal of a high school there. It was idyllic for a kid. I had a whole island for a backyard. I lived there until I was eight years old and we moved to Santa Barbara. That was a rough transition to make. I remember being the only kid in second grade who couldn\'t tie his shoelaces, because I had never worn shoes on the island.      (1992, on The Waterdance (1992)) The role required a lot of research. I spent every day for three or four months at the hospital, never getting out of the wheelchair. I would have lived there, but there aren\'t enough beds as it is.      (1992, on being private) I\'m in one of the most public professions in existence. But I\'ve always felt that the less you know about an actor\'s personal life, the more you can get involved in the story in which he\'s playing a character. And I don\'t like to see movies where you know about everything that happens behind the scenes. I can\'t engage in the story if I know what\'s going on in the actor\'s head. I don\'t want to see the zipper in the back of the monster suit. Like everybody else who goes to the movies, I want to believe the monster is real.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['Cindy Bandolini', '""Cindy is a Massachusetts mobster\'s daughter.""']","['Kelly Morgan', '""""']","[[<bound method Tag.get_text of <p>

This movie had so many chances to be comedic, dramatic and even
interesting, but just failed on so many levels. In some instances the
actors were so ""acting"" that it was just unbelievable. Nothing good
here. Joey Lauren Adams is just good to listen to because she is a bit
sexy. Hell it is so bad that I just saw the end and I can't remember
how it ended... I had to make this comment at least 10 lines for it to
be posted. Now, you have to know that I am just writing to get it
posted. This is how bad this movie was. If you get stoned or do some
LSD, it just might be your cup of tea. If you have the brain power to

If I were to express my true views of this film, it would not be

just can't understand what possibly possessed this guy to make this

Evidently, black people don't go to harvard, but if they do, rest

blacks in the film were a gun toting roommate and a nymphomaniac

missing was to have them eat some fried chicken and have grills. I am
lost for words. Let me use some pseudo-deep philosophy to ponder it,
similarly to Kirkegaard, as would be said in the film. I really hope

The beginning of this movie is weak, and overly simplistic, especially the

However, it gets better. You feel the guy's confusion in his head, his

The biggest disappointment is it ends abruptly. The plot could have been

I am a fan of the offbeat independent genre of filmmaking and I found this
to be a rather interesting entry into it. I really like morality tales but I
feel a bit ripped when the ending doesn't end with a crash and burn (much
like Risky Business or The Graduate). What does save this movie is the first
ninety percent of it. Here are my reasons (some spoilers contained within):
(1) I loved the sharp dialogue in this movie. Some of the lines that I heard
throughout the film I will probably remember for quite sometime. (2) Adrien
Grenier's performance was excellent and the best in the film. Seeing him go
through that acid trip was enough for me to recommend him for an acting
award. The words ""Oscar Clip"" should have been blinking at the bottom of the
screen. (3) Sarah Michelle Gellar was enticingly evil as Grenier's
boyfriend. Even her alter-ego would probably want to stab a stake in her
heart. (4) The acid trip sequence is about as messed up as any sequence I
have ever seen in a movie. As I saw Eric Stoltz's face become visually
distorted, I felt like I had dropped acid myself. (5) The philosophical
value in this movie is about as heavy as gold. I love it when movies inject
philosophy into the plot of a film because the film is then acknowledging
that something is supposed to be learned by watching it and therefore it
isn't stupid. Most mass-produced movies don't have this phenomenon. (6) The
most surprising aspect of the movie goes to Al Franken. He is the last
person that I would ever expect to do a cameo in the movie and I don't think
his talent was wasted or misplaced. (7) This is the second movie I have ever
seen by James Toback and I found his style of filmmaking to be an acquired
taste (much like that of Paul Thomas Anderson). He did a splendid job
directing this movie however. (8) I found the choppy cinematography to a
blessing. If the cinematography hadn't matched the somewhat choppy story to

score of eight.<br><br>The downers I thought were (1) the choppy editing and (2) that sad excuse

manner but the job was unfit anyway. I blame the denouement for that, if
there had been a nice crash and burn at the end (much like Donnie Darko and
The Dangerous Lives Of Altar Boys) the film wouldn't have been so choppy to
begin with. All movies that are made to send a strong moral should have the
character suffer a big loss in his or her life that they have to live with
forever. Granted the ending does have some of that, it didn't really pay off

I love Sarah Michelle Gellar, she is capable of fantastic acting as
made clear in the Buffy series. She has, unfortunately, been given no
opportunities to show her considerable talent in film. While Cruel
Intentions is a bad movie, Harvard Man is one of the worst - if not the
worst - movie I have ever forced myself to sit through. The writing is
practically non-existent. There are many scenes of back and forth
dialogue with little purpose but to fill time. There are several
simultaneous plots (gambling, drug addiction, sexual cheating, dealing
with the mob), none of them interesting in their execution. There is no
coherence - each plot thread seems forced in to fill time and is not
interwoven with a big theme. One soon gets the feeling that the movie
was started with little passion from the director, then finished in a
hurry to meet a deadline. Harvard Man is transparently what it is: a
quickly-made attempt to capitalize on Gellar's fame. To watch it is to
wait for its end, amazed that such a thing actually made it as a major
motion picture. I CAN'T believe the average rating here is close to 5.
Anyone who says this movie is anything but awful is either mentally
deficient or has an agenda. The only reason to watch this movie is to
gawk at its atrociousness.

The ""troublesome teen"" years proved just that for Jeff and his parents were compelled at one point to intervene when problems with drugs and marijuana got out of hand.He recovered and began shaping his nascent young adult career appearing on TV as a younger version of his father in the acclaimed TV- movie Silent Night, Lonely Night (1969), and in the strange Burgess Meredith film The Yin and the Yang of Mr. Go (1970). Following fine notices for his portrayal of a white student caught up in the racially-themed Halls of Anger (1970), his career-maker arrived just a year later when he earned a coming-of-age role in the critically-acclaimed ensemble film The Last Picture Show (1971). The Peter Bogdanovich- directed film made stars out off its young leads (Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shepherd) and Oscar winners out of its older cast (Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman). The part of Duane Jackson, for which Jeff received his first Oscar-nomination (for ""best supporting actor""), set the tone for the types of roles Jeff would acquaint himself with his fans -- rambling, reckless, rascally and usually unpredictable).Owning a casual carefree handsomeness and armed with a perpetual grin and sly charm, he started immediately on an intriguing 70s sojourn into offbeat filming. Chief among them were his boxer on his way up opposite a declining Stacy Keach in Fat City (1972); his Civil War-era conman in the western Bad Company (1972); his redneck stock car racer in The Last American Hero (1973); his young student anarchist opposite a stellar veteran cast in Eugene O\'Neill\'s The Iceman Cometh (1973); his bank-robbing (also Oscar-nominated) sidekick to Clint Eastwood in Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974); his aimless cattle rustler in Rancho Deluxe (1975); his low-level western writer who wants to be a real-life cowboy in Hearts of the West (1975); and his brother of an assassinated President who pursues leads to the crime in Winter Kills (1979). All are simply marvelous characters that should have propelled him to the very top rungs of stardom...but strangely didn\'t.Perhaps it was his trademark ease and naturalistic approach that made him somewhat under appreciated at that time when Hollywood was run by a Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino-like intensity. Neverthless, Jeff continued to be a scene-stealing favorite into the next decade, notably as the video game programmer in the 1982 science-fiction cult classic TRON (1982), and the struggling musician brother vying with brother Beau Bridges over the attentions of sexy singer Michelle Pfeiffer in The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989). Jeff became a third-time Oscar nominee with his highly intriguing (and strangely sexy) portrayal of a blank-faced alien in Starman (1984), and earned even higher regard as the ever-optimistic inventor Preston Tucker in Tucker: The Man and His Dream (1988).Since then Jeff has continued to pour on the Bridges magic on film. Few enjoy such an enduring popularity while maintaining equal respect with the critics. The Fisher King (1991), American Heart (1992), Fearless (1993), The Big Lebowski (1998) (now a cult phenomenon) and The Contender (2000) (which gave him a fourth Oscar nomination) are prime examples. More recently he seized the moment as a bald-pated villain as Robert Downey Jr.\'s nemesis in Iron Man (2008) and then, at age 60, he capped his rewarding career by winning the elusive Oscar, plus the Golden Globe and Screen Actor Guild awards (among many others), for his down-and-out country singer Bad Blake in Crazy Heart (2009). Bridges next starred in Tron (2010), reprising one of his more famous roles, and received another Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his role in the Western remake True Grit (2010). In 2014, he co-produced and starred in an adaptation of the Lois Lowry science fiction drama The Giver (2014).Jeff has been married since 1977 to non-professional Susan Geston (they met on the set of Rancho Deluxe (1975)). The couple have three daughters, Isabelle (born 1981), Jessica (born 1983), and Hayley (born 1985). He hobbies as a photographer on and off his film sets, and has been known to play around as a cartoonist and pop musician. His ancestry is English, and smaller amounts of Scots-Irish (Northern Irish), Irish, Swiss-German, and German.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net          Spouse (1) Susan Bridges (5 June\xa01977            - present)\xa0(3 children)          Trade Mark (4)        Gregarious demeanor        Often plays very relaxed and mellow characters        Regularly has played ""everyman"" type roles up against considerable adversity, especially in his more dramatic roles        In his early years, often played very handsome but obstinate, idealistic or even rude young men who desire to buck authorityTrivia (78)      Met his wife, Susan Bridges, in 1975 while filming Rancho Deluxe (1975) - she was working as a maid on a dude ranch.

When a Freshman at Brentwood Academy in 1964, he was on the High School Football ""A"" Team.

In 2010, both he and Colin Firth were nominated for the Academy Award in the category \'Best Leading Actor\' (for Crazy Heart (2009) and A Single Man (2009) respectively). Bridges won the award. The next year, both men were again contending in the same category (for True Grit (2010) and The King\'s Speech (2010) respectively), with Firth winning this time.      Before asking out wife-to-be Susan Geston while shooting Rancho Deluxe (1975) on location in Montana, Jeff snapped a photo of her just before having his proposal abruptly declined. Thereafter, the happily married man carried the photo as a reminder of that brush-off.      Refers to the art of acting as using his ""pretend-muscle"".      The longest he has gone without an Oscar nomination is 16 years, between Starman (1984) and The Contender (2000).      Became a father for the 1st time at age 31 when his wife Susan Bridges gave birth to their daughter Isabelle Annie Bridges, aka Isabelle Bridges, on August 6, 1981.

Jeff\'s father was from a family that had long lived in the United States (since the 1600s on many lines), and had English, and some Scots-Irish (Northern Irish), ancestry.

Is an avid fan of the TV series Peaky Blinders (2013) which he binge-watched.Personal Quotes (31)      As far as the lack of hits goes, I think perhaps it\'s because I\'ve played a lot of different roles and have not created a persona that the public can latch on to. I have played everything from psychopathic killers to romantic leading men, and in picking such diverse roles I have avoided typecasting.      I don\'t think I ever went down that movie star path. I always enjoy taking a 90-degree turn from the last thing I did.      A large part of acting is just pretending. You get to work with these other great make-believers, all making believe as hard as they can. What I learned most from my father wasn\'t anything he said; it was just the way he behaved. He loved his work so much that, whenever he came on set, he brought that with him, and other people rose to it.      Basically, one of the hardest things about being an actor is getting your first break. I\'m a product of nepotism. The doors were open to me. I\'d done several movies before I decided what I wanted to do. There was a certain amount of guilt and worry about whether I really had what it takes. I thought I\'d spare my girls that.      My father [Lloyd Bridges] encouraged his kids to go into showbiz, not because he wanted to live vicariously through them, but because he dug it so much. Growing up there was like a mild competition with my father and my brother, not so much maybe in reality, but in my own mind.      Most cynics are really crushed romantics: they\'ve been hurt, they\'re sensitive, and their cynicism is a shell that\'s protecting this tiny, dear part in them that\'s still alive.      When you start to engage with your creative processes, it shakes up all your impulses, and they all kind of inform one another.      I kind of rebelled against it. I resisted it. I didn\'t know what I wanted to do when I was a kid and was reluctant to go into, y\'know, Dad\'s line of business.      I had years of partying, and I was kind of surprised and happy I survived it all. Now, being a parent, I look back on it thinking, Oh God, the things you did!      (on working with Kevin Spacey on K-PAX (2001) and their similarities in working] I\'ve been a big fan of his work -- The Usual Suspects (1995), American Beauty (1999), L.A. Confidential (1997). He\'s a really good actor and he turns out to be a wonderful guy as well. We approach acting in the same way in that we both enjoy the process. We both like rehearsals and we understand the value of them. There are some actors who don\'t like to engage with other actors; they just like to relate to each other between ""Action!"" and ""Cut!"" But I\'ve always felt that getting to know the people you\'re working with can inform and enrich the work. The closer you get, even if you\'re playing opposites, the better the work. Some actors are afraid of leaving it all off-camera or getting the characters confused, but I don\'t see it that way. I often feel that the actual movie is like the skin sloughed off the snake; it\'s the by-product of the real valuable stuff, which is the real-life experience of doing it.      [on his father, actor Lloyd Bridges] My father, unlike his father, was very supportive of all his kids getting involved in movies and acting in general. He loved what he did and wanted to turn his kids onto it. He thought it was a great way of meeting people, being creative, and traveling around the world and doing what you love to do.      I went from high school -- bang! -- into the movies. I did spend a few weeks in acting classes in New York when my father was there doing ""Cactus Flower"". But most of my training really came from my parents and my brother [Beau Bridges].      For a long while I wasn\'t sure I was going to make acting my main focus professionally. I was interested in music, painting and other creative pursuits. I did the movies with a little more capricious an attitude; I wasn\'t so seriously minded as a total professional. Then came The Iceman Cometh (1973) We had eight weeks of rehearsals and then we shot for two weeks. So it was almost the reverse of how most movies are made. During those eight weeks, I was sitting around with these great actors and this great director, just shooting the breeze and, of course, going over the material. I was also getting to know how other actors of that caliber work on things like this. It was very enlightening. After that experience, I decided, ""Hey, I can do this. And I can do this for the rest of my life in a professional way"".      When I was offered the part of The Dude in The Big Lebowski (1998), I went through a big thing in my head worrying if this was going to be a bad example for my girls. The guy was kind of an anti-hero, a pot-smoking, slacker kind of guy, and I was really racking my brain about it. I always want to feel free to play any role, a despicable guy or a good guy -- the full range of human experience. But this one was really giving me problems. So I assembled the family and told them my problem. After a long pause, my middle girl said, ""Dad, you\'re an actor. We know that it\'s all pretend what you do. We know that when you kiss some lady on the screen that you still love Mom. We know you\'re an actor"". So I had their permission, their blessing, to go play a character like The Dude. That was great that they understood that. And I count on the audiences to understand that what I do in my personal life and what I do on the screen are not some kind of example for them to base their lives on. Hopefully, when people see a movie, they know it\'s a movie.      I\'m very proud of The Last Picture Show (1971). It was absolutely thrilling when I got that part. Peter Bogdanovich was just great, and the whole ensemble was too - Cloris Leachman and Ellen Burstyn and Tim Bottoms and Cybill. When we were doing it, we all had the feeling that we were doing something unique and special. For me, that film stands alone. It\'s not like any other movie I can think of. It just hangs there by itself. It\'s still and slow and quiet.      I\'m glad I survived the \'60s. They were dangerous. Fun, too. Everything in your life teaches you something.      I\'ve been involved with two big flop Westerns [Heaven\'s Gate (1980) and Wild Bill (1995)]. I don\'t know if Americans still care about Westerns. I hope they do. There are some wonderful ones still to be made. - 2001.      Acting is tough some times. It can be a complicated case. A lot of ins, a lot of outs, a lot of what-have-yous, a lot of strands to keep in your head, man. But, you know, you manage.      [on Heaven\'s Gate (1980)] I remember going to the New York premiere. I\'m not sure he (Michael Cimino) had seen the movie complete; he was scrambling to put it together. Afterward we heard that terrible stuttering applause, and it was that sinking feeling. We tried to tell ourselves, ""Well, maybe they liked it so much that they are stunned into silence.""      Probably 150 less movies are going to be made next year (2010), and that\'s very concerning to all actors. It\'s hard enough finding a great script, but now it\'s going to be tougher. -- on how the economy is affecting the film industry.      To get a good script at any age is kind of a rare thing. The movie-going audience is mainly young guys, and (producers) want to target them. It kind of makes sense from their standpoint, but an interesting story is an interesting story. I remember being a younger guy liking to see movies with older folks in them, so that never deterred me. -- on ageism in the film industry.      The hardest thing about acting is getting a foot in the door and that was all handled by my dad. The fact is, I\'m a product of nepotism. And that took some getting used to. Life will supply you with gutters. Having a famous father. Feeling that stench of nepotism. That\'s a gutter right there.      [on what advice he\'d give to himself as a young actor starting out] Have fun. Don\'t take it too seriously. Don\'t mistake this for reality. Be sincere, but don\'t get too serious. But that\'s a life direction too, it doesn\'t just apply to movies.      (On The Big Lebowski (1998) It\'s kind of a masterpiece, man. It\'s like The Godfather (1972) - I see it on the tube and I think I\'m just going to watch a couple of scenes, but I end up watching the whole thing.      [on Crazy Heart (2009)] This one was kind of a challenge - I find I\'m most challenged by things I really care about, because I really want to do them well. It causes quite a bit of anxiety. But that very thing you\'re afraid of is kind of like a blessing in disguise. If you didn\'t have that fear, you wouldn\'t have the other side - courage and bravery, positive emotions. As an actor, you get used to those fears, and you\'re almost happy when they show up. It makes you learn your lines and prepare. Then when it\'s finally time to pull the trigger on the thing, you relax and let it come out.      I like to think of myself as a character actor, though there\'s some redundancy in that... I\'m very pleased with my career, the stories I\'ve told. I consider myself very lucky as to how it all came down. I don\'t really care about having more fame than I have. [2010]      [on incorporating digitized images of deceased actors in current films] I don\'t know quite how I feel about that. I guess it\'s progress. You can\'t slow that thing down. I imagine they\'ll soon be able to - if they don\'t do this already - take a little De Niro, a little Brando, a little Bridges and just a drop of Julie Andrews and shake that up. It\'s gonna get weird.      [on releasing his first album of songs] People like to put things in a box - and they do that with their own lives too, they limit things - but it\'s all art to me. To me, all art is truth. People try to define things and make it easier for their mind to digest things, I guess. But music has been part of my life since I was a kid. Music meant more to me when I was young, but I went into acting because of family and because because it was the path of least resistance.      On Michelle Pfeiffer: I bet her a thousand dollars after that movie (The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989)) came out that she\'d be offered a recording deal, and she still owes me.      On Michelle Pfeiffer: She\'s a wonderful combination of beauty, mystery and funk. The funk factor is her ordinariness, the surfer girl from Orange County. These elements are mixed with her courage to do things she is frightened of and the talent to make us believe.      [remembering director Michael Cimino] In 1973, Mike Cimino cast me as Lightfoot in the first movie he directed - Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974). I was just starting out, just a kid. I remember being up in Montana wondering why he had picked me. I didn\'t feeling anything like the character I had been hired to play. I felt inadequate, undeserving, confused. The day before shooting began I confessed this all to Mike. This was Mike\'s first movie, one he had written as well. He\'d been given this opportunity by Clint Eastwood, the movie\'s producer and star. I felt sorry for Mike. This was a big break for him, and here he was the day before his movie was to start shooting, and this frightened young actor who had a major roll in it was telling him he didn\'t know if he could do it. After not too long a pause, Mike looked at me, and said, ""You know that game Tag?"" ""Yeah,"" I said. ""Well... You\'re it,"" Mike told me. He went on to say that this guy, Lightfoot, was no one other than me, that I couldn\'t make a mistake, or a false move, even if I wanted to. I\'ve never forgotten that bit of direction that that young director gave me on his first movie, that gift of confidence. I\'ll often bring it to mind when that feeling of inadequateness, that feeling of not deserving what I\'ve been given comes to me. I\'ll remember to enjoy the game, this game of \'Tag.\' A few years later, after Mike won an Academy Award for directing The Deer Hunter (1978), he cast me again in another movie. Now he was an award winner, and along with Coppola, Bogdanovich, & Scorsese, a \'Hollywood Darling\', encouraged to make whatever movie he wanted to make. Heaven\'s Gate (1980) is what he had in mind. A movie about a particularly fascinating time in American History when Cattle Barons, sanctioned by the United States government, waged war on emigrants - the Johnson County Wars. I was cast to play John Bridges, a character Mike loosely based on one of my relatives. The many months of shooting in Montana were a one of a kind movie making experience. When ""Heaven\'s Gate"" came out, many critics called it a flop, a disaster. Well...that\'s just their opinion, man. To me, and many others, it\'s a masterpiece, and grows in beauty each time it\'s seen. Michael Cimino was a splendid filmmaker.

He was an actor, known for Bad Company (1972), Piranha (1978) and Daisy Miller (1974). He died on June 27, 1978 in Silver Lake, California.Trivia (4)      Brother of actress Marilyn Brown.      Shot himself to death.      In August of 2003 his brother, James Brown, published ""The Los Angeles Diaries,"" a memoir of growing up in a dysfunctional family troubled by crime, alcoholism, drug abuse and the ultimate suicides of his two siblings, Barry Brown and Marilyn Brown, the latter having killed herself by jumping from a bridge into a concrete Los Angeles river bed.      Barry Brown\'s first film appearance was a bit, walk-on role in 1958\'s In Love and War; his last film was 1978\'s Piranha - both of which starred Bradford Dillman.Personal Quotes (5)      I usually do get typecast for my sensitivity and my soft looks, my gentle looks -- I very rarely get cast as a villain.      The only time I\'m not unhappy is when I\'m acting.      An overdeveloped imagination is necessary to being a good actor. But left to itself alone in a room, it can take over. It\'s like a demon that somehow leaps out of you and starts to do things to you.      The most important thing in the world is being in the spotlight. I don\'t know why.

The Missouri-born and -raised Davis\' relaxed, easygoing manner and Southern drawl easily fit most moviegoers\' image of the cowboy, and Republic put him in a ton of them over the years (the fact that, unlike a lot of movie cowboys, he looked right at home on a horse didn\'t hurt, either). He alternated between good-guy and villain roles, one of his better ones being that of the devious, murderous fur trapper working for Kirk Douglas\' competition in The Big Sky (1952). He is best known, however, for his role as Ewing family patriarch Jock in the long-running TV series Dallas (1978).- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       frankfob2@yahoo.com          Spouse (1)               Blanche Hammerer          (1945            - 26 April\xa01981)\xa0(his death)\xa0(1 child)          Trade Mark (2)        Deep, gravelly voice.        The role of Jock Ewing on Dallas (1978).Trivia (11)      Only child Tara Diane (15 January 1953 - 9 February 1970) died in a car crash at age 17.      He was very close to Dallas (1978) co-star Victoria Principal, who bore a strong resemblance to his late daughter, and he had Principal\'s picture along with his daughter\'s in his pocket when he was buried.      In April 1981 the writers of Dallas (1978) decided not to write his death into the storyline right away. They initially thought about replacing him with another actor, but out of respect decided that only Davis should play Jock Ewing. Jock was kept alive on the show (he was down in South America drilling for oil) until early 1982 when it was learned that he died in a plane crash.      Best remembered by the public for his role as Jock Ewing on the 1980s soap opera Dallas (1978).      Survived by his mother, Ethyl O. Davis, who died on January 10, 1984 in Overland Park, Kansas.      His parents owned and operated the Davis Funeral Home in Dearborn, Missouri from 1914 to 1948.      His maternal grandparents were Otho Dock Offutt (1831-1912) and Elizabeth Rogers Hughes Offutt (1864-1937).      He was the son of Lucian Davis (1878-1954) and Ethyl Offutt Davis (1890-1984). They are buried in Camden Point Cemetery, Camden Point, Platte County, Missouri.      For many years, Davis suffered a series of migraine headaches, which led to his terminal brain cancer that eventually claimed his life.      Didn\'t have to walk too far, in between scenes, while doing Dallas (1978), prior to suffering his own health problems, but was determined to keep working, until he was unable to. He had to leave the show, when the cast (and himself) knew that he was dying in 1981 (though he almost appeared in every episode of the 1980-81 season).

2500 movies I've viewed so far. Indeed, it falls right into that
category of ""one of the great films you most likely haven't seen."" Why
movies like this go unrecognized like they have is beyond me. If you've
seen it, you already know what I'm talking about, so I wonder if I'm
preaching to the converted here. I doubt I have much to say beyond what
any other reviewers have already covered. This is a gritty and real,

Gordon Willis of the Godfather movies - enough said) and littered with
dark comedy, not of the laugh-out-loud variety, but of the ""these guys

with both Jeff Bridges and David Huddleston, some 25 or so years prior

Best movie ever, best western ever. It's so superb, it's art. I first
saw it over ten years ago and had an actual moving experience. No movie

the hit single comes directly from the film itself. Filmed in and
around Emporia, Ks. it features a young Jeff Bridges perfectly suited
for the role as patsy/predator Jake and the equally suited for his role
of Drew Dixon is the elegant Barry Brown. Friends off screen, this was
their second pairing in a film, and it just goes to show in their
complete dissimilar partnership as they end up the two sole survivors
of an initial runaway gang of young boys, most of them fit for the
Civil War draft, echoing the Vietnam crisis. John Savage is the perfect
brutish snake and all the actors seemed just as born into their parts
as the two leads. If for no other reason, watch it for Barry Brown(Drew
Dixon) and be prepared to be entranced. But,be careful, he was also too
beautiful for words. Don't fall in love like me.

People who put down westerns have probably never seen Barbarosa, McCabe
and Mrs. Miller, One-eyed Jacks, or this fine film. Released in 1972,
Bad Company reflects some of the values of its day (thus proving the
value of the western genre). Our heroes begin by dodging the draft in
the Civil War, then proceed across the plains in a manner true to
history if not to romance. But the basic theme is that of parentless
youths set adrift to discover their own values. Superb acting
throughout -- veteran Jim Davis, for instance -- and excellent
production on a small budget. My favorite quote: an outlaw about to be
hanged demonstrates some fancy gun-work with an unloaded revolver. He
wows the audience, hands the gun back to Jim Davis, and mutters,""Hell,
I'm the oldest whore on the block.""

Underrated and often overlooked, BAD COMPANY remains one of the top five
westerns ever produced. Its realistic depiction of life in The Old West
predates the far less realistic but highly-touted ""down to earth""  approach
in Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN. [Not that I'm knocking UNFORGIVEN; it's
another of only a handful of truly great westerns.] Jeff Bridges steals the
show (as is his wont), but it's the overall effect the film has that makes
it so memorable. Neither the subject nor the filmmaker's approach is
cliched; BAD COMPANY is an original in every sense of the word. Poignant
and
funny, it's ultimately bittersweet- and one great movie.

Overlooked little gem from the counter-cultural era (1972). It's about
as unromantic a view of the Old West as you're likely to find this side
of a hog wallow. Nice Christian boy Bruce Brown flees the Civil War and
a Union press-gang only to head west and fall in with a youthful gang
of petty thieves. The story is really about his gradual corruption from
innocent survivor to hardened stickup man. But more than a morality
tale, the movie debunks about every glamorized cliché you've ever seen
about life on the frontier. <br><br>Consider the following-- a homesteader escapes from frontier poverty
prostituting his wife along the way; hungry kids get their heads
splattered for stealing a pie; companions steal from strangers and even
from each other ; and worst of all are the six-guns that don't even
shoot straight. I expect there's more truth packed into these 90
minutes than in a ton of traditional Westerns. But who wants reality
when myth is so much more comforting. Just look at these guys, scruffy,
dirty, and dressed like they're wearing every garment they've ever
owned-- even the Black Hole of Calcutta would consider them a health
hazard. Then there's the pitiful hovels of the settlers that stick up
like ugly warts on a sea of futility. It's really the visuals that tell
the story and with scarcely an ounce of romanticism.<br><br>Jeff Bridges is terrific as Jake, the sort-of-charming but ""he'd steal
your shoes"" gang leader. Ditto, David Huddleston as the philosophical
prairie king-pin, and Jim Davis as the ice-cold marshal (I really did
expect the camera to turn away from the hanging). Brown's okay, but I'm
not sure how well his more complex role and concept is written. All in
all, this so-called anti-Western is a logical reaction to decades of
prior Hollywood myth-making, which may have been entertaining but was
also profoundly misleading in its conventions. Nonetheless, Bad Company
is also highly entertaining, and despite the obscurity, a major
revisionist film from a rebellious time period.

They unabashedly emulate and hold up western, and adult, behavior, for
all to see and as boys they have a lot to learn, and as moviegoers, so
do we. In this perfect film the boys hold up a mirror to the world, and
our preconceived notions, about the west, what it is to be a man, and
in doing so, truly show us the way as they try to find their's. They
practically play at cowboys for us, until the real big bad world comes
along and smashes in, with violence, a stark world around them and for
us the viewers, our ideas about our past. And this is where the real
story is. The lead actor Barry Brown as Drew Dixon brought this film to
what most consider it's art-like appeal. His performance is haunting,
beautiful, and unforgettable. Without him, there's no film, in my
opinion. His foil is aggravating, oafish, Jeff Bridges who a fan of
his, will appreciate, as he gets the boys time and time again into
trouble none of them asked for. Young John Savage is there, rightly
brilliant as usual, playing an evil snake in the grass. None of the
characters are without pathos, redeeming factors, and a likability. The
entire cast, named and unmentioned here, are perfectly cast and no bit
routines are allowed, each with private identities enriching the story.
This movie leaves me haunted and it is still the finest, and best of
it's kind.

all, this so-called anti-Western is a logical reaction to decades of
prior Hollywood myth-making, which may have been entertaining but was
also profoundly misleading in its conventions. Nonetheless, Bad Company
is also highly entertaining, and despite the obscurity, a major
revisionist film from a rebellious time period.

They unabashedly emulate and hold up western, and adult, behavior, for
all to see and as boys they have a lot to learn, and as moviegoers, so
do we. In this perfect film the boys hold up a mirror to the world, and
our preconceived notions, about the west, what it is to be a man, and
in doing so, truly show us the way as they try to find their's. They
practically play at cowboys for us, until the real big bad world comes
along and smashes in, with violence, a stark world around them and for
us the viewers, our ideas about our past. And this is where the real
story is. The lead actor Barry Brown as Drew Dixon brought this film to
what most consider it's art-like appeal. His performance is haunting,
beautiful, and unforgettable. Without him, there's no film, in my
opinion. His foil is aggravating, oafish, Jeff Bridges who a fan of
his, will appreciate, as he gets the boys time and time again into
trouble none of them asked for. Young John Savage is there, rightly
brilliant as usual, playing an evil snake in the grass. None of the
characters are without pathos, redeeming factors, and a likability. The
entire cast, named and unmentioned here, are perfectly cast and no bit
routines are allowed, each with private identities enriching the story.
This movie leaves me haunted and it is still the finest, and best of
it's kind.

His father, Richard Starkey, was a former dockworker turned baker; his mother, Elsie (Gleave) Starkey, was a bakery worker. His parents divorced when he was three and he and his mother, Elsie, moved to another home in Liverpool. While attending Silas Infants\' Schools he suffered from many afflictions that basically ruined his education: he had constant abdominal pains, was once diagnosed with a ruptured appendix that led to an inflamed peritoneum, which also led to one of his first surgeries. Ringo was in a coma, and his recovery took a couple of months, during which more operations were performed, and he was known to be accident-prone. Shortly after he came out of the coma, he was trying to offer a toy bus to another boy in an adjoining bed, but fell and suffered from a concussion. When he finally was able to go back to school, he learned that he was far behind in his studies. At age 13 he caught a cold that turned into chronic pleurisy, causing him another stay at a hospital in Liverpool. A few lung complications followed, which resulted in a treatment in yet another children\'s hospital, this time until 1955. Meanwhile, Richard\'s mother Elsie had married Harry Graves, the man who her son referred to as a ""step-ladder"".At the age of 15 he could barely read or write, although he had aptitude for practical subjects such as woodwork and mechanics. At that time he dropped out of school and got his first job was as a delivery boy for British Rail. His second job was a barman on a ferry to New Brighton, and his next was as a trainee joiner at Henry Hunt & Sons. Ringo injured his finger on the first day of his new job, and then he decided to become a drummer. His dream came true, when his stepfather bought him a new drum kit, and Richard promised to be the best drummer ever.In 1957, together with Eddie Miles, he started his own band called \'Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group\'. At that time he became known as Ritchie, and eventually became caught in the Liverpool\'s Skiffle craze. Although he was self-taught, he was a good time-keeper, and developed an original beat with his signature accentuations, due to his left-handed manner of playing on the right-handed drum set. He traveled from band to band, but he eventually landed a spot with ""Raving Texans"", which was a backing band for Rory Storm, later known as ""Rory Storm & The Hurricanes"", a popular band at that time Liverpool. Rory Storm encouraged Richard to enhance his career by legally changing his name to Ringo Starr. The Hurricanes topped the bill at one of Liverpool\'s clubs, where The Beatles also had a gig. Ringo\'s group was at times sharing popularity with The Beatles and Gerry and the Pacemakers. He wanted to leave The Hurricanes to join another group called ""The Seniors.""Before Ringo, The Beatles tried several other drummers. At one point they were so desperate, that they even invited strangers from the audience to fill the position. Then came Pete Best who was not considered by the other band members to be the greatest drummer, and they were keen to recruit Ringo as his replacement. On June 6, 1962, at the Abbey Road studios, The Beatles passed Martin\'s audition with the exception of Pete Best. George Martin liked them, but recommended the change of a drummer. Being asked by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison; Epstein fired Pete Best. After a mutual decision the band was completed with Ringo Starr. Ringo contributed to their first hit in September of 1962, when The Beatles recorded Love Me Do, which charted in UK, and reached the top of the US singles chart.Ringo\'s steady and reliable drumming became essential in their studio sessions, as well as in their numerous and exhausting live performances across the world. Ringo\'s positive disposition as well as his drumming style played the pivotal role in shaping the famous image and music style of The Beatles as they are now known to the world, under the management of Brian Epstein and music producer George Martin. Ringo filled the position of a drummer for The Beatles in the most critical time of the band\'s formation. He quickly connected with the other three members of The Beatles, and contributed to their music and creativity with his easy-going personality, light humour, reliable drumming and inventive musicianship. All four members were charismatic and individually talented artists, they sparked each other from the beginning. Eventually they made a much better group effort under the thorough management by Brian Epstein whose coaching helped consolidate their talents and mutual stimulation into beautiful teamwork.Starr had dreamed of becoming a professional actor since his younger years. He wanted to be in movies probably more so than the other members of The Beatles. In 1964, during the first months of Beatlemania, Ringo coined the phrase \'A Hard Day\'s Night\' which soon became the official title of the Beatles\' first movie, in replacement for the working title \'Beatlemania\'. Ringo received great reviews for his performance in A Hard Day\'s Night (1964) and Help! (1965). At first, Ringo did not have a songwriting career, although he had no problem with his name recognition, however, he had a problem with getting his songs noticed. At that time he got help from his friends; John and Paul wrote a song or two for him to sing on their albums, such as ""Boys"", ""I Wanna Be Your Man"", ""Honey Don\'t"", and ""Yellow Submarine"". During his eight-year career with The Beatles, Ringo wrote two original songs: ""Don\'t Pass Me By"" and ""Octopus\' Garden"" for which he also sang the lead vocals. Besides his drumming, Ringo\'s voice was recorded on many of the most popular Beatle\'s songs, contributing to their unique sound and tight harmonies.He had a hectic solo career during the 1970s, after the breakup of The Beatles. However, Ringo eventually emerged as a steady performer, and sustained a very popular solo career, turning out a dozen chart-topping hit songs and eight best-selling albums. He made a famous appearance together with George Harrison, Ravi Shankar, and other popular musicians in the landmark \'Concert for Bangladesh\' in 1971. His 1973 solo release ""Ringo"" was the last album to feature all four living Beatles, although not on the same song. He also appeared in various TV shows, including his own special, Ringo (1978), and a TV mini-series, Princess Daisy (1983), with his wife Barbara. In 1984 he did narration for the children\'s series Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends (1984). During the 1980s, after having a long period of troubles with alcohol, Ringo and his wife attended a rehabilitation clinic, and came back to the scene sober. He made the All-Starr Band tour of America and Japan. The tour was so popular that he formed another All-Starr Band lineup in 1992, and began an American and European tour in June of that year. Since then Ringo Starr has been enjoying a continuous career as the leader of the All-Starr Band. In 1994, along with George Harrison and Paul McCartney, the three surviving members of The Beatles, reunited and produced Lennon\'s previously unknown song \'Free as a Bird\'. It was preserved by \'Yoko Ono\' on a tape recording made by John Lennon in 1977. The song was re-arranged and re-mixed with the voices of three surviving members, and became an international hit. \'Free as a Bird\' was also included in The Beatles Anthology TV documentary which was watched by 420 million people in 1995. Ringo, Paul and George sang their new songs, in addition to mixing their voices and music arrangements to John Lennon demos.Ringo\'s old friend and band-mate George Harrison passed away on November 29, 2001, after a long battle against lung cancer. The following year, on the anniversary of Harrison\'s death, Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton appeared in a Concert For George, to raise money for the support of Harrison\'s legacy in exploration of alternative lifestyles, views and philosophies. Starr also supported charitable organizations with consideration to those who have special needs.Ringo Starr updated the role of a drummer in popular music, he made drummer an equal partner to the lead musicians, thus changing the whole paradigm in how the public saw drummers. His original performing style evolved from adjusting his natural left-handed manner of playing to the right-handed drum set, and allowing his left hand lead in weaving a pattern tightly intertwined with the music of other players, and adding such enhancements as unusual accents and stops. Ringo\'s musical originality as well as his inventive drumming patterns, time signatures and accentuations became essential to the sound of The Beatles. His on-stage presence and acting talent as well as his humor and musicianship was the essential part in formation and remarkable career of The Beatles.He was married to his long-time girlfriend, Maureen Cox, from 1965 - 1975, and they had three children: Zak Starkey, Jason, and Lee. The couple broke up in July of 1975, and he married actress Barbara Bach. Ringo Starr divides his time between his residences in England, in Switzerland and his home in Los Angeles, California.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Steve Shelokhonov          Spouse (2) Barbara Bach (27 April\xa01981            - present)           Maureen Starkey (11 February\xa01965            - 17 July\xa01975)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(3 children)          Trade Mark (5)        Has worn sunglasses in and out since the 1980s        More often than not sports a beard        Peace sign        Complicated, individualistic drum fills, such as phrasing just slightly after the beat        Unique sound and style that influenced successful drummers from Phil Collins to Dave Grohl.Trivia (51)      Drummer with The Beatles (1962-1970).      Leader of ""Ringo Starr\'s All Starr Band"".      Had three children with Maureen Starkey: Sons Zak Starkey (a featured drummer with The Who) and Jason (born August 19, 1967) and daughter Lee (born November 17, 1970).      Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Beatles on January 20, 1988.The Beatles had several drummers before Starr joined. Pete Best had been with them for two years, when he was fired after failing the band\'s audition for George Martin at EMI.      He is three months older than John Lennon, who founded The Beatles, and the last to join the group, technically making him both the oldest and youngest Beatle.      Is naturally left-handed but his grandmother corrected him and now writes right-handed. However, he plays left-handed with a right-handed drum set and makes unusual accents and stops.      He and the other members of The Beatles were awarded MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) in the 1965 Queen\'s Birthday Honours List for their services to music. John Lennon returned his MBE in protest in 1969 over the Vietnam War. Paul McCartney was awarded Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire in the 1997 Queen\'s New Years Honours List for his services to music.      Though Paul McCartney is the most successful former member of The Beatles, Ringo actually had more solo U.S. Top Ten hits (McCartney performed most of his Top Ten hits with Wings).      Born and grew up in the Dingles section of Liverpool, England. Attended St. Silas School and Dingles Secondary Modern School.      Before becoming an official member of The Beatles in 1962, he played many gigs with them, guesting when Pete Best was not available. Also made one recording with them, backing a singer named Wally, before he joined.      A single of his, ""The No-No Song"", was a song against drug abuse. But in a darkly ironic note, the song was banned from several radio stations because of the drug references.      Wrote the song ""Octopus\'s Garden"" while on vacation. He claims to have got the idea for the song after conversing with a chef about octopi.      In the mid-1970s, he was involved with British singer-songwriter Lynsey de Paul and appeared on a single she wrote for Dame Vera Lynn.      Got the last name ""Starr"" from his birth name, Starkey. He got ""Ringo"" because he liked to wear rings on all his fingers.      ""Ringo Starr"" was a natural stage name for a young man who had grown up loving Western movies (he particularly admired Gene Autry, the ""singing cowboy""). Considered moving to Texas before joining The Beatles.      Bought Tittenhurst Park estate from John Lennon (Lennon\'s last English home), when John and Yoko Ono decided to move to America; the deal came complete with Ascot Sound Studios, located on the grounds, and home of several albums (""Plastic Ono Band"", ""Imagine"" and ""Fly""). He renamed the facility Startling Studios. Judas Priest planned to record their album ""British Steel"" there, but preferred the acoustics of the house itself (which they had leased).      Got his first set of drums as a present from his stepfather, who brought them back from London. Was able to turn professional with a £25 loan from his grandfather Starkey to make a deposit on a better drum set.      Missed several years of school, because of illness growing up. Learned to read and write with the help of a neighbor girl, who became his babysitter.      Was the only member of The Beatles to willingly accept Yoko Ono in John\'s life (and consequently theirs); he offered them the use of his London apartment, while John and Cynthia Lennon settled their divorce. Yoko tried to return Ringo\'s kindness over the years, and years later, when John was murdered, Ringo and future wife Barbara Bach flew to New York, to keep Yoko company.      Is a strict vegetarian, as is former bandmate Paul McCartney.      According to George Harrison, Starr unintentionally inspired a number of songs by his witty off-the-cuff remarks. For example, after a long session on The Beatles first film, he was heard to say, ""It\'s been a hard day\'s night."" That was approved by the studio as the title of the film and subsequently the song, ""A Hard Day\'s Night"". John Lennon affirmed this in his 1980 Playboy interview, mentioning that ""Ringo-isms"" had supplied the titles of ""A Hard Day\'s Night"" and ""Tomorrow Never Knows"".      Is a longtime fan of the comedy troupe Monty Python and even appeared on an episode of Monty Python\'s Flying Circus (1969).      In 1985, he accepted the role of Locke Walls on The Guiding Light (1952) but pulled out at the last minute. The role was recast with Jeremy Slate.      Was the first member of The Beatles to ""drop out"" of their visit to India in the spring of 1968, to study with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Despite packing some home comforts (like cans of baked beans), he could not handle the spicy cooking the camp offered, and was missing his family.      Played drums on several songs by Paul McCartney on the album ""Pipes of Peace"" (1983).      (November 11, 2004) The Beatles were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame for their outstanding contribution to British music and integral part of British music culture.      The first song he sang with The Beatles, as far as actual album cuts go, was a cover of The Shirelles\' classic ""Boys"".      The first song he had a hand in writing for an album by The Beatles was ""What Goes On"", from the album ""Rubber Soul"" (1965) (which he co-wrote with John Lennon and Paul McCartney). He began his own first song ""Don\'t Pass Me By"" years earlier, but it did not appear until the ""White Album"" (1968).      Two of his biggest solo hits, ""It Don\'t Come Easy"" and ""Photograph"", featured ex-bandmate George Harrison on guitar and backing vocals.      ""Stop and Smell the Roses"" was engineered and mixed by Bruce Robb in association with Bruce Robb Productions.      He and The Beatles were awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Recording at 7080 Hollywood Boulevard.      In April 1963, Ringo purchased a slightly used drum kit at Drum City, a local outlet. In exchange for payment, their manager Brian Epstein agreed to paste the distributor\'s ""dropped T"" logo as well as the manufacturer\'s name, ""Ludwig"", on the drum. The logo, the ""large T"" in Beatles, was adopted into their trademark in 1969.      While recording ""Stop and Smell the Roses"" at Cherokee Studios, he was joined by two former members of The Beatles and their wives. John Lennon and Yoko Ono, as well as Paul McCartney and Linda McCartney, came into Cherokee to collaborate with Ringo on the solo album. Ronnie Wood from The Rolling Stones also collaborated, adding guitar, bass, saxophone, keyboards and back-up vocals.      First of The Beatles to become a grandfather upon the birth of son Zak Starkey\'s daughter, Tatia Jayne Starkey, in 1985.      The 2009 Sunday Times List estimated his net worth at $196 million.      Was originally hired as a member of The Beatles for a salary of £25 a week, with the promise of a full partnership in the band in time. The promise was kept, and after the band began to have hit records, Starr\'s mother discovered the top of his dresser covered with money (wondering at first if it was all come by honestly), and opened a savings account for him. Nonetheless, Starr\'s initial £25 salary was never discontinued, and he would pick it up every week from NEMS (Brian Epstein\'s management company). He used it for pocket money.      Inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 2002.      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Recording at 1975 North Vine Street in Hollywood, California on February 8, 2010.      In his time as a member of The Beatles, Starr single-handedly consolidated ""Ludwig"" as the drum set of choice among popular bands of his era.      Starr mystified many of his contemporaries with his practice of draping light towels over his snare drum in order to deaden the characteristic timbre of his instrument. He famously removed the front skin of his bass drum and stuffed the cavity with cushions to deepen the punch of the bass sound.      Starr cites drummers Jim Keltner and Cozy Cole as major influences on his career as The Beatles\' drummer. Starr and Keltner performed as a team at The Concert for Bangladesh (1972), and Keltner played drums on Starr\'s ""Rotogravure"" album.      Friends with Keith Moon. The two shared a house in California in the mid-1970s with John Lennon and Harry Nilsson, while they worked on each other\'s records.Phil Collins states Ringo as his biggest influence as a drummer and songs such as ""That\'s All"" (by Genesis), ""Thru\' These Walls"" and ""We Said Hello Goodbye"" deliberately copied Ringo\'s style of drumming. Collins said he particularly admired Starr\'s ""great rolls"" and ""unbelievably individualistic fills"" in ""Ticket to Ride"", his ""complicated"" fills in ""A Day in the Life"" and ""the drags and his way of phrasing just slightly after the beat on the toms"" in ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".      His brother-in-law is Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh.      While he owns property in several countries, he is officially a British citizen residing in Monaco (2001).      ""Yellow Submarine"" was The Beatles\' only #1 single with Starr as lead vocalist.      Sixteen years before they met and married, his wife Barbara Bach was in the audience at The Beatles\' 1965 Shea Stadium concert.      Author Neil Gaiman is a huge fan of Starr.      Profiled in the book ""The Big Beat--Conversations with Rock\'s Great Drummers"" (1991), edited by Max Weinberg.      In a curious coincidence, Ringo is the actual Japanese word for apple. ""Apple"" was also The Beatles\' record label founded in 1968.Personal Quotes (32)      [on his early drumming years with The Beatles] I started to be an engineer but I banged me thumb on the first day. I became a drummer because it was the only thing I could do. But whenever I hear another drummer I know I\'m no good. [John Lennon] taught me the song I sing. I can only play on the off beat because John can\'t keep up on the rhythm guitar. I\'m no good on the technical things but I\'m good with all the motions, swinging my head, like. That\'s because I love to dance but you can\'t do that on the drums. I figure we\'re good for another four years. I don\'t want to invest me money in stocks or anything. I just want to have it and draw 20 or 30 quid a week. The main thing is, I don\'t ever want to go back to work.      [on meeting Elvis Presley in 1965] The saddest part is that, years and years later, we found out that he tried to have us banished from America, because he was very big with the FBI. That\'s very sad to me, that he felt so threatened that he thought, like a lot of people, that we were bad for American youth. This is Mr. Hips, the man, and he felt we were a danger. I think that the danger was mainly to him and his career.      I\'d like to end up sort of unforgettable.      I don\'t like talking. It\'s how I\'m built. Some people gab all day and some play it smogo. I don\'t mind talking or smiling, it\'s just I don\'t do it very much. I haven\'t got a smiling face or a talking mouth.      [on is marriage to Maureen Cox [aka Maureen Starkey] She\'s just sort of ordinary, she\'s from Liverpool. And the genuine fans wrote in saying, you know, ""If you are going with her, good luck and I hope you\'re happy."".      I remember the day [son Zak Starkey] was born. It was the first time I\'d felt totally useless. There was [Maureen Starkey] having our baby. She kept on crying ""Help!"" and I kept asking ""How?"".      I\'ve never been able to sit round on my own and play drums, practice in the back room, never been able to. I\'ve always played with other musicians. It\'s how I play, there\'s no joy for me in playing on my own, bashing away. I need a bass, a piano, guitar, whatever, and then I can play.      I think the most exciting thing is that you expect people our age to know the music, but actually a lot of kids know the music, and if anything is left, we have left really good music, and that\'s the important part, not the mop-tops or whatever.      I never studied anything, really. I didn\'t study the drums. I joined bands and made all the mistakes onstage.      We were the first generation that didn\'t go into the army. I missed the call up by, like, 10 months, and so we were allowed, as these teenagers, not to be regimented and turn into these musicians.      I\'m probably the best rock \'n\' roll drummer on earth. I say that now because I used to be embarrassed to speak up for myself.      ... [Beatlemania]\'s always on. There\'s nothing we can do about that. What\'s more interesting to me is that our records are still coming out. And they\'re the same records and the new generation gets to hear them, and as far as that\'s concerned, that\'s the most important thing to me. The music we make, it\'s still going on.      ... it\'s well-documented, in 1964 that old Bill Ludwig, he presented it to me. I bought these Ludwig drums, and in the shop in England, the guy wanted to take the sign out, but I love everything American, the music and the instruments. So I made him leave the sign on. So I was a running commercial--on Sullivan [Ed Sullivan\'s Toast of the Town (1948)], and all that touring of America, it said ""Ludwig"" drums.      [on reaching age 70] As far as I\'m concerned, in my head, I\'m 24. That\'s just how it is. The number, yeah, it\'s high. But I just felt I\'ve got to celebrate it. I\'m on my feet and I\'m doing what I love to do, and I\'m in a profession, as a musician, where we can go on for as long as we can go on. I\'m not hiding from it, you know.      Now I\'ve realized to make the music I like there\'s no real reason to go to a studio. The other day, we were downloading an Echoplex machine and you just download the damn thing! I\'ve been through quite a lot of technology, you know, but... I have two bits of wood in my hand and I hit those buggers and I love it!      My stepdad was great, he taught me about Sarah Vaughan, Billy Eckstine, people like that. I learnt all the music I had from Bill Haley in 1954, Frankie Laine and on.      [2011] When I started, there was rock, there was pop, there was country. That was about all. And now it\'s divided into 30 categories. Now I don\'t know one from the other.      The \'70s wasn\'t bad. I thought the \'80s was all synthesised, even the drums, and there were weird people playing the drums.      We\'ve known Bob [Bob Dylan] since the early \'60s and if he\'s playing L.A., I go and see him. It\'s just one of those things. He is a giant in my mind.      I bought one record once because of the drums, and that was Cozy Cole doing ""Topsy"". But all the records I bought were for the whole record. It\'s not like I was searching out drummers and that. Al Jackson was great, of course. It\'s always been the whole band and the singer that\'s really excited me.      I had this dream at 13 to play drums, nothing else, play drums. And when I got to play the drums, when I finally got a set when I was nearly 18, I wanted to play with good people and I started playing with the best band at the time, and then the next best band and then the biggest band, the best band of all. That\'s how it\'s always worked for me. I just wanna play, I wanna support the band. I love the band mentality. I love playing with other musicians. I\'m not the one who can sit in the back room and practise, but if you can play piano and guitar I\'ll play with you all night. I don\'t like it as a solo gig, where you\'re just banging away. That\'s why I never did drum solos, there\'s really no need for them.      I don\'t want to go back anywhere. I want to deal with what\'s in front of me now to the best of my abilities, and sometimes that\'s not very good. But a lot of the days it is really great.      I love the modern technology now. I was a little opposed to it - ""Oh, in my day, we used to have a donkey turning the wheel, and two guys chewing tape to make it soft."".      [on downloading individual songs] It\'s a different time, and I\'m afraid to say that\'s what I do. If you made a record, I\'d probably pick out tracks that I like and download that. That\'s just how it is. We have to go with that because it\'s changed.      Peace and love, peace and love. It\'s up to you. I\'m always doing it.      [on filming Let It Be (1970)] The police came to stop us, and I was on the roof: ""Come on, drag me off!"". It would be so dramatic, and the damn cop wouldn\'t drag me off!      [2012] I\'ve been asked to write an autobiography of myself, but they really only want those eight years. And I say, ""But there are 10 volumes before we get to that, and 20 afterwards."".      I was blessed with great timing. The other blessing that makes my drumming individual is that I was born left-handed. But my grandmother turned me into a right-handed person, so I\'m ambidextrous. If I throw anything - play cricket or golf - it\'s done left-handed. But I write and cut with my left hand. I\'m a weird handy guy.      The music industry is still musicians playing music. If it has changed in any way, it is that nobody who really cares about music is running the industry. In the \'80s, accountants ended up running it, and they still are. The record industry has fallen apart. But we are on to the new age, a digital one.      When we came out, we were this big crazy pop band with these weird haircuts - which weren\'t really that weird. But that is what they said. We got lucky.      Everything the government touches turns to crap.      [at a celebration in his honor on January 20, 2014] It\'s a weird place to be this evening.

I could never hold a job for more than three months, which works out well because that\'s how long a movie shoots.      [2004] Being a celebrity couple is not so easy - it\'s double the publicity, and it\'s hard to have a private life...I have to tell you that I am happier with my life now then ever: I have a great son and a great career. I\'m not only here, but here stronger than I\'ve ever been - I have absolutely no regrets about the ups and downs of my career.      [on his recovery from cocaine addiction] Well, a couple of times I had people come have a talk with me, but I was operating, for the most part, on two hours of sleep a night, and I realized, ""I can\'t do this and last very long."" So I cleaned up (in the early \'90s) and then the jobs stopped coming. You clean up your life and think you\'re supposed to be rewarded for it, but things actually got worse. On the other hand, if I hadn\'t sobered up, I probably wouldn\'t be alive today.      There are three things being a celebrity is good for: raising money for charity, dinner reservations and tee times.      I was a guy back in the \'80s who was one movie away from a huge career, which at that time didn\'t happen. In the \'90s, I worked a lot, but it was kind of, ""get out there and dig and find things"". Then I guess The Rookie (2002) and Far from Heaven (2002) were referred to as my comeback. I look around and a lot of the people I started in the business with, I have no clue where they are right now. So much of it has to do with luck and I have been extremely lucky, but a large part of it is also just hanging in there.      Movies seem to be happening to me rather than me going out there and saying, ""Well, I\'m going to play this."".      [on The Express (2008)] At its core, it\'s about living your life with grace. If God bestows grace upon you, that you should live your life to its full effect. You know, Ernie Davis embodied that in his short life. He touched everybody around him.      I love being a dad. Basically it\'s the most gratifying, rewarding relationship in life. But at the same time, it certainly is the most challenging.      [observation, 2013] What\'s going on in television reminds me of what was going on in movies in the \'70s, where the inmates had kind of taken over the asylum. And they\'re doing a lot of interesting things that I myself want to watch. The studios are just giving more of their tent-pole remakes of, you know, what\'s been successful before. I really don\'t find it all that interesting.      [2008 interview] I have no regrets. There\'s only one real regret that I have, and that\'s that David Lean, who is my favorite director of all time, gave me the role of Nostromo in ""Nostromo"". And I went over there to Nice and met with him and got to ask him every question there was, spent an afternoon with him. Unfortunately, he wound up dying of cancer before we could shoot the film.

If somebody had pointed out to me the odds of my being a working actress getting paid for what she does, I probably would have quit early in the game.      If it\'s not some daring, dangerous affair, it\'s just not interesting, or so it seems. So, here you have two people - a famous American iconic couple - who actually like each other sexually, in marriage. Imagine.      Did you know that, if you visualize, you can actually hug on the phone?      I\'m not perfect, but I\'d like to be perfect. I\'m working on it.      I don\'t believe in predestination, even though I was raised a Presbyterian.      Not everyone can be trusted. I think we all have to be very selective about the people we trust.      There was always a feeling for me that it would work. That\'s what keeps me going. You go in with a positive attitude and stay there, and that\'s a big part of what does make it work.      I like men to be men and I like them to care about me and to take care of me. I\'m willing to let them do that.      If you don\'t quit, and don\'t cheat, and don\'t run home when trouble arrives, you can only win.      I\'ve helped people get rid of headaches by placing my hand on their forehead, and backaches by placing my hand on their back. It\'s a powerful example of love that really works.      I think, head up and shoulders back. Not only does it make you look taller and thinner but it gives you confidence and boosts your self-esteem.      I\'m a real \'go, go\' person...

Like airline disaster movies, one staple of 1970's cinema that was ripe for
spoofing was the sub-genre of pre-historic melodrama influenced by ""Korg:
1,000,000 B.C.""(1966). Enter, ""Caveman,"" a movie as willing to stick it to
this genre as ""Airplane!""(1980) was willing to do so to the Airport series,
and countlessly similar movies and made-for-TV movies. You won't exactly
find humor on the level of Monty Python's Flying Circus, The Young Ones, or
Daria here, but it's still good for some laughs.<br><br>Atouk(Ringo Starr) has a huge crush on his tribal leader's wife Lana(Barbara
Bach), but even if he didn't he's severely mistreated by Tonda(John
Matousak), just because he can do so. Tonda is a huge thug who'd rather
allow his fellow tribe-members to get eaten by numerous dinosaurs(which they
call ""Machas""), than try to save them. After he tries to ""zug-zug"" with
Lana, he's kicked out of the tribe, and on the way finds Lar(Dennis Quaid)
who was previously left to die after being injured fleeing a
Macha.<br><br>Along the way they run into Tala(Shelly Long) and her blind father, Gog(Jack
Gilford) who nearly drowns in a tar pit until Atouk and Lar save him. Tala
immediately falls for Atouk, but he's not interested, which is a shame
because she was gorgeous. Shelley Long has never looked as good as she does
here. If I were in Atouk's position, I'd dump my aloonda for Lana and
zug-zug Tala till she screamed like a Macha, and perhaps even afterwards.
Evan Kim is interesting as Nook, the leader of the much more articulate
cavemen, who are NOT all WASP heterosexuals of normal size, and and decides
to join Atouk and his growing clan as they team up to eventually battle
Tonda and his clan for both Ool(food) and pride. Atouk is admired by many
other primitive people he comes across, partially because he discovers fire,
chiropractic medicine, hallucinogenic plants, and rhythm, which is why Starr
is perfect for the role.<br><br>The big disappointment here is the fact that the DVD has no translation card
of the primitive language, which was originally offered to patrons of the
movie when it was first released. At least they could've made a translation
section as one of the special features. Other than that it was as silly as
hell, and well worth seeing.<br><br>

Very few films have the capacity to change the way we think and feel about
the world around us. This is one of them.<br><br>This touching film is about daring caveman Atouk and his brave companion
Lar, who are expelled from their tribes, journey through exotic, precambrian
lands, learning about the people and world around them. Ultimately they form
their own tribe and, more importantly, learn cameraderie, the heart of what
it means to be human and to have love. Caught up in the chaos of a savage,
ancient world, Atouk and Lar eventually have to struggle just to stay alive.<br><br>This movie lost the Best Picture Oscar in 1981, but history will likely
remember ""Caveman"" for much longer. And with more fondness. The
cinematography is excellent. Alan Hume's prehistoric world is photographed
as a mystical paradise. Then, we see the horror of human greed, lust and
cruelty, also stunningly photographed. There is also a nice scene with a
bunch of people thrashing about in a large pile of dung. It looked so
realistic, that for a moment, I felt like it wasn't a movie, but a
documentary.<br><br>The acting is top notch, especially early performances from Dennis Quaid,
who exposes his buttocks and Barbara Bach, who should have. In one scene,
Dennis Quaid makes impressive use of method acting, urinating against a
glacier. And Ringo Starr deserved the Oscar he unfairly lost to Dudley Moore
that year.<br><br>Everyone needs to see this movie at least once. Although it might be a
little disturbing, the violence is not gratuitous, the love affairs wistful
and heartbreaking. Despite the tragic elements, however, the movie is
inspirational. One of the best films to come out of the 80s!<br><br>It's underrated films like this that don't get any publicity and the
over-rated, pointless films do. I guess that's just the way Hollywood
operates. This is one of the saddest, most touching, most unsettling, most
moving films I've ever seen. It's one of the best. It nakedly shows the
rudimentary nature of humanity, by showing our primal origins, when a fire,
meat and the warmth of a lover and support of friends was all that kept us
from the brink of death. ""Caveman"" captures and horrifies the viewer. There
is something
classical about the plot of ""Caveman."" If Aeschylus was alive today and

I just had a look at the new DVD of one of my all-time favorite comedies
(and I don't watch a lot of comedies), `Caveman.'  It's one of the VERY few
comedies that I can watch more than once.  The rudimentary nature of much
of
the humor doesn't, in my opinion, make it a kid's film, although I think
lots of kids would enjoy it.  Bumping your head or falling on your arse has
been funny since the Jurassic period.  That's one of the great constants of
human culture.  Mix in some stop-motion rubber dinosaurs and a huge bug,
and
I think you'd have to have a stick permanently implanted up the bum not to
at least get some laughs.<br><br>After reading some of the other comments, I'd like to make a point or two
about this film: Yes, the stop-motion dinosaurs are not realistic.  It's a
comedy (duh!), and they're supposed to be funny, not realistically
frightening a la Jurassic Park.  The language spoken isn't Swedish (are you
putting us on, dude from Toronto?), but a prehistoric language fabricated
for this film.  Caveman flicks have been doing that at least since the 1940
version of `One Million B.C.,' and these made-up caveman languages always
sound to me a bit like Esperanto, another fabricated language.  The
language
in `Caveman' may have been intended to parody that old film
cliché.<br><br>The menu of the new DVD offers multiple soundtracks in English, French and
Spanish.  Be sure to check them out, suckers.  There's really no extras on
the DVD (some commentary from Ringo might have been fun), but it has an
excellent anamorphic picture, which is enough for me.  It never looked
quite
as good as it does here.  It's just a good-natured comedy that's executed
with style and artistry.  It looks great, has some superb comedic actors
that hit just the right note, and gets maximum effect from the simple gags
it presents without in the least belaboring them (Mel Brooks fanatics, take
note).

I remember seeing this film at the Drive-in way back in '81. Back then
I thought it was great. Very funny film with a good solid cast, and the
best Dinasores ever. And to see Bull (Richard Moll) as the snow monster
is wonderful. With one great joke after another, you don't need to
speak cave talk to understand this gem. They just do not know how to
make movies like this anymore. Now do not get me wrong, all that CGI
stuff is great and all, but I really like these movies with the stop
animation, it takes me back to the days of Ray Harryhausen. I recommend
this film to watch when ever you need a good laugh.<br><br>Four stars.

Some have been a bit harsh with this little film and
totally missed the point.
We all know that dinosaurs and man didn't coexist
but that is beside the point.
This film refuses to take itself seriously and why
should it?
What I found charming was the language the cave
folk used,not until a man from the land of the rising sun,seemed to help
us
viewers with some of the more obscure words.
Like the difference between""Aloonda and Zugg-Zugg"".
(There's a difference?).
It figures that the Japanese man would offer the translation,but he gives
up
and goes along with
their slang.
John Matuszak,former NFL player,was a perfect casting as
Tonda.
Some of their very important ""discoveries"" are a real hoot
too.
Look for a surprise actor playing the Snowman!

I had pretty low expectations when I first saw this movie.  I then found it
hilariously funny.  Some of the humor is a little juvenile, but the
""caveman"" language (developed by Ringo Starr himself ... I think he claimed
once on the Tonight Show that his favorite word was ""zug-zug,"" which meant
""having sex"") was great; also an amusing scene where the cavemen who speak
this language meet a caveman who speaks English and tries to teach it to

Caveman is one of those movies which, like Airplane, is funniest at it's
first viewing. Subsequent viewings don't really stand the test of

the film. They're all animated by stop-motion and have the most ridiculously

decorations.<br><br>This movie is also almost entirely dialogued in ""Caveman-ish"" Apart from one
scene, there's no English spoken at all. However, it takes almost no time to
pick up the entire caveman vocabulary and you'll find caveman words creeping

In the Stone Age, the strong caveman Tonda (John Matuszak) is the
leader of a hostile tribe and the outcast Atouk (Ringo Starr) feels
unrequited desire for Tonda's mate Lana (Barbara Bach). One day, Atouk
is walking with his best friend Lar (Dennis Quaid) and they meet the
cavewoman Tala (Shelley Long). They save her blind father Gog (Jack
Gilford) from a tar pit and Tala fells unrequited affection for Atouk.
Soon the smart Atouk becomes the leader of the misfit tribe and dispute

the leader needs a worthwhile mate.<br><br>""Caveman"" is a hilarious silliness and is among the silliest movies

introduced Ringo Starr to Barbara Bach that married each other in the

Like airline disaster movies, one staple of 1970's cinema that was ripe for
spoofing was the sub-genre of pre-historic melodrama influenced by ""Korg:
1,000,000 B.C.""(1966). Enter, ""Caveman,"" a movie as willing to stick it to
this genre as ""Airplane!""(1980) was willing to do so to the Airport series,
and countlessly similar movies and made-for-TV movies. You won't exactly
find humor on the level of Monty Python's Flying Circus, The Young Ones, or
Daria here, but it's still good for some laughs.<br><br>Atouk(Ringo Starr) has a huge crush on his tribal leader's wife Lana(Barbara
Bach), but even if he didn't he's severely mistreated by Tonda(John
Matousak), just because he can do so. Tonda is a huge thug who'd rather
allow his fellow tribe-members to get eaten by numerous dinosaurs(which they
call ""Machas""), than try to save them. After he tries to ""zug-zug"" with
Lana, he's kicked out of the tribe, and on the way finds Lar(Dennis Quaid)
who was previously left to die after being injured fleeing a
Macha.<br><br>Along the way they run into Tala(Shelly Long) and her blind father, Gog(Jack
Gilford) who nearly drowns in a tar pit until Atouk and Lar save him. Tala
immediately falls for Atouk, but he's not interested, which is a shame
because she was gorgeous. Shelley Long has never looked as good as she does
here. If I were in Atouk's position, I'd dump my aloonda for Lana and
zug-zug Tala till she screamed like a Macha, and perhaps even afterwards.
Evan Kim is interesting as Nook, the leader of the much more articulate
cavemen, who are NOT all WASP heterosexuals of normal size, and and decides
to join Atouk and his growing clan as they team up to eventually battle
Tonda and his clan for both Ool(food) and pride. Atouk is admired by many
other primitive people he comes across, partially because he discovers fire,
chiropractic medicine, hallucinogenic plants, and rhythm, which is why Starr
is perfect for the role.<br><br>The big disappointment here is the fact that the DVD has no translation card
of the primitive language, which was originally offered to patrons of the
movie when it was first released. At least they could've made a translation
section as one of the special features. Other than that it was as silly as
hell, and well worth seeing.<br><br>

Very few films have the capacity to change the way we think and feel about
the world around us. This is one of them.<br><br>This touching film is about daring caveman Atouk and his brave companion
Lar, who are expelled from their tribes, journey through exotic, precambrian
lands, learning about the people and world around them. Ultimately they form
their own tribe and, more importantly, learn cameraderie, the heart of what
it means to be human and to have love. Caught up in the chaos of a savage,
ancient world, Atouk and Lar eventually have to struggle just to stay alive.<br><br>This movie lost the Best Picture Oscar in 1981, but history will likely
remember ""Caveman"" for much longer. And with more fondness. The
cinematography is excellent. Alan Hume's prehistoric world is photographed
as a mystical paradise. Then, we see the horror of human greed, lust and
cruelty, also stunningly photographed. There is also a nice scene with a
bunch of people thrashing about in a large pile of dung. It looked so
realistic, that for a moment, I felt like it wasn't a movie, but a
documentary.<br><br>The acting is top notch, especially early performances from Dennis Quaid,
who exposes his buttocks and Barbara Bach, who should have. In one scene,
Dennis Quaid makes impressive use of method acting, urinating against a
glacier. And Ringo Starr deserved the Oscar he unfairly lost to Dudley Moore
that year.<br><br>Everyone needs to see this movie at least once. Although it might be a
little disturbing, the violence is not gratuitous, the love affairs wistful
and heartbreaking. Despite the tragic elements, however, the movie is
inspirational. One of the best films to come out of the 80s!<br><br>It's underrated films like this that don't get any publicity and the
over-rated, pointless films do. I guess that's just the way Hollywood
operates. This is one of the saddest, most touching, most unsettling, most
moving films I've ever seen. It's one of the best. It nakedly shows the
rudimentary nature of humanity, by showing our primal origins, when a fire,
meat and the warmth of a lover and support of friends was all that kept us
from the brink of death. ""Caveman"" captures and horrifies the viewer. There
is something
classical about the plot of ""Caveman."" If Aeschylus was alive today and
making films, he would have made ""Caveman.""<br><br>The vivid imagery and music is outstanding, but the acting and intensity
shown is very realistic. This is one of the most harrowing, gripping films
I've ever seen, reminding me of so many other films of the era. ""Quest for
Fire"" being one, but ""The Killing Fields"" being another. ""The Killing

They\'ve remained friends ever since.Personal Quotes (4)      [on guitarist Gaye Delorme] When people used to see Coltrane play, sax players would run out of the clubs going \'I quit! I\'ll never play again! I can\'t take it!. On a quieter scale, that\'s exactly how Gaye mad me feel. He had a neat little trick. All good musicians do. He said, \'Can I sit in, and do you mind if if I can borrow your guitar?\' And then he took the same instrument that I\'d been struggling with and make it sound like Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton, all rolled in one.      I\'ve met a lot of jazz musicians in my day, and they\'re all funny. Cannonball Adderley was a riot, Miles [Miles Davis] had the most dry sense of humor ever, always had something clever to say. I think what is is is jazz musicians - they\'re so careful about what notes they play, everything they do is to impress the listener. And that\'s what comedy is. Comedy is the ultimate truth. Jazz is hitting the notes that that no one else would hit, and comedy is saying words that no one else would say. And Gaye was the master. He was really just a special guy.      [on his mother] She really helped me. The thing about her, she was a white woman and she was married to my dad who was Chinese, and she said ""Remember this: you\'re mixed so people are always going to look at you, they\'re going to notice you. So it\'s up to you how you conduct yourself, but you\'re going to be noticed.""      The trouble when you\'re doing something illegal is that you know what you\'re doing. You\'re lying to your parents, you\'re lying to your kids.

He was the first-born child of Louis and Neva Dotrice who prospered as bakers. The Germans occupied the island in 1940 and he and his mother and brother escaped to England.Advancing his real age, Roy joined the Royal Air Force at age 16 and was trained as a wireless operator and air gunner. In 1942 his plane was shot down and he was captured where he served out the remainder of WWII (over three years) as a prisoner of war in Germany. He was introduced to the idea of performing when he took part in various makeshift concerts in order to raise the spirits of his fellow captives.Following WWII and his release, Roy decided to pursue his acting ambitions. After studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, he began appearing in English repertory where he met and married (1947) actress Kay Dotrice who at the time was performing under her given name of Katherine (Kay) Newman. Throughout the early post-war years, the couple performed together in repertory with Charles Denville and the Denville Players. At different times he was a member of the Liverpool, Manchester and Oldham repertory theatres. Also during this great time of productivity, Roy produced and directed some three hundred stage plays. He formed his own troupe, the Guernsey Theatre Company, in 1955. The highlight of his theatrical career, however, began in 1957 when Roy became a member of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford, England, (later the Royal Shakespeare Company). For the next nine years he performed in a lengthy succession of the Bard\'s works, first in small parts as various players, officers and gentlemen. He subsequently went on to become a notable Iago, Falstaff and Julius Caesar, among others. A popular performer, he had an uncanny ability to play much older than he was. He later went on to perform with the American Shakespearean Festival.The notoriety he received from his abundant classical theatre experience led directly to radio, film, television and Broadway offers. Roy has appeared in a number of Broadway productions over the years, receiving a Tony nomination for his work in ""A Life"" and finally winning the trophy for his heralded performance in the 2000 revival of ""A Moon for the Misbegotten"" starring Cherry Jones and Gabriel Byrne. Known for his considerable success in one-man shows such as Abraham Lincoln, Charles Dickens, Will Rogers and Winston Churchill, his superb one-person show ""Brief Lives"", drawn from the Elizabethan diaries of John Aubrey, played for over 1,700 performances over a period of nearly a decade. At one time this set a record for a solo performance and was listed in the ""Guinness Book of World Records"".Dotrice made his credited feature movie debut supporting Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris in The Heroes of Telemark (1965), and has since lent class and distinction to a spattering of films. Among his list of credits include the bawdy comedy Lock Up Your Daughters! (1969); the sumptuous biopic Nicholas and Alexandra (1971); the Oscar-winning Amadeus (1984), Milos Forman\'s adaptation of composer Mozart\'s life in which Roy portrayed Mozart\'s stern and domineering father Leopold; and The Cutting Edge (1992) as an Olympic skating coach.Perhaps better remembered on the small screen, he appeared magnanimously as a host of monarchs including his Edward IV in The Wars of the Roses (1965) and King George IV in the syndicated miniseries Shaka Zulu (1986). To American audiences he is probably best known as Jacob Wells, the Beast\'s surrogate father, in the dramatic series Beauty and the Beast (1987). Dotrice was also cast in the recurring role of Father Barrett, a Catholic priest and confidante of Judge Henry Bone (played by Ray Walston), on the acclaimed Emmy-winning drama Picket Fences (1992).Since the end of the 1970s he has lived and worked primarily in America. More recently he appeared on stage reviving his outstanding 1993 role as George Bernard Shaw in ""The Best of Friends"" in 2006. His devoted wife Kay died on August 2, 2007, after 60 years of marriage. The couple has three daughters (Michele, Karen, Yvette), all whom at one time or another were actresses. Karen, who is now primarily out of the business, became the best known perhaps for her childhood Disney portrayals, notably in Mary Poppins (1964). Combined, his daughters have presented him with seven grandchildren.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net          Spouse (1) Kay Dotrice (8 August\xa01947            - 2 August\xa02007)\xa0(her death)\xa0(3 children)          Trivia (21)      Began acting when he was a Prisoner of War in World War II.

Cheech &amp; Chong's The Corsican Brothers (1984) was a re-telling of the

had to market their comedy towards a different audience. There hard

they change their style of humor, they toned it down dramatically.
Sadly, no one wanted to see a period piece starring Cheech and Chong.
The movie is not horrible but it's not a laugh riot. Not wanting to end
the partnership, the duo made another comedy album and a video that
went along with it called GET OUT OF MY ROOM. The video was a tad under

would become Cheech's stepping stone towards mainstream acceptance.<br><br>Recommended for Cheech and Chong fans. Others will want to stay away

I enjoyed this movie more than ""Yellow Beard"", but both movies are kind
of similar as they are both period pieces and departures for the two
guys best known for their marijuana humor. Nothing of that sort is in
this movie, but I still found it relatively humorous in places. I found
it a bit funny that the hero of this one was Tommy Chong who was always
the more stoned one in the other movies. I liked the humor where if
pain is inflicted on one of the twins the other feels the pain, this
was especially good in a torture scene involving Cheech. Still, it is a
movie that probably would have been better with two other actors in the
lead roles. Nothing against Cheech and Chong, but they really do not
look like they belong in this movie. For the most part the rest of the
cast are not A-list starts, and a lot of them seem to be related to two
leads. The story is about a couple of twins that feel the others pain
going against a French ruler. Not much else to it than that. Most of
the jokes are about the shared pain, there are other jokes, but a lot
of the other jokes not related to their shared pain miss the mark.
Still the movie was mildly amusing and I thought it was better than
""Yellow Beard"" because that one had a plot that was kind of all over
the place.

If you are looking for deep plots which will draw you in and capture
your attention for an evening, and potentially leave you thinking after
the movie... this (along with everything by these two) is not your
flick. I personally enjoy and appreciate it for what it is, along with
the others. It is not a work of art or a fantastic story... but instead
an ironic view of the world.<br><br>Well... as for the movie. It (as I am sure that everyone has read)
provides two brothers of noble birth raised for some portion of their
lives as peasants and separated in youth by coincidence. The brothers
later unite 21 years later in a heartfelt moment (NOT) and assume each
other's company for the remainder of the movie. Beyond this point,
Chong utilizes his inept belligerence and desire for revolution to lead
him and his brother (Cheech) through a series of perils and near misses
which (as destiny would have it) leads to the unloading of a very
strange guy who wields the queen's power... and thus the renewal of
happiness in France in centuries past. As this alone is not enough,
each brother (from day one) carries a strange connection which enables
them to experience each other's feelings (both emotional and physical)
and not their own... a nifty sub-plot which brings about some fun irony
throughout the movie.<br><br>This is not a movie that you would wish to watch to challenge your
mind... but it is wonderful when the rigors of reality tug at you and
you wish to escape for a moment. I believe this to be true about all of
Cheech and Chong's movies... but this slight bend of taste provides new
humor not found in their all too famous stoner movies.<br><br>One final note... this (unlike others) is a decent movie to watch with
kids, although I am not sure that they will understand or appreciate
the humor as would an adult.

I just can't believe that I will ever disagree with another persons
review of a movie more than the previous persons review of The Corsican
Brothers. This movie is so hilarious that I own it, and have had the
pleasure of watching it dozens of times. In their last good movie
together, Cheech and Chong depart from the usual drug humor, and will
have you rolling (pun intended!) with laughter! Set during the French
Revolution, The Corsican Brothers is a laugh fest form beginning to
end, and is a movie that I have and will continue to recommend to
everyone that enjoys a good laugh. Anyone that could write a review
stating ""I didn't even smile once"" had to have not understood some of
the humor. Please watch this movie. You won't be disappointed.

I have seen this movie many times, and every time I finish watching it,t
he
same commentary comes into mind. Cheech and Chong are trying very hard to
make this movie funny, but they fall short of achieving that goal. The two
basically have the only funny moments in the whole movie. Besides there
Corsican Brothers, I could not get into any other character. Watch this
only
if your a big Cheech and Chong fan, or, stick to their earlier movies like
Up In Smoke, Next Movie, and Nice Dreams.

In March, 2002, after my parents and I had seen the disturbing - but
very well done - ""In the Bedroom"", we felt like we needed something
really light, so we rented ""Cheech &amp; Chong's The Corsican Brothers""; I
mean, what could be more easygoing than a movie starring filmdom's
favorite goof-ball stoners? This one turned out to be probably their
lowest movie ever. For starters, no drug humor. It features them as
siblings in pre-revolutionary France (despite the fact that they talk
like 20th century Americans) making a mess of the status quo. Much of
the little humor that the movie provides derives from the fact that if
one of them gets injured, the other feels it.<br><br>So, this is definitely not the Cheech &amp; Chong movie that I recommend.
Their other movies are far better. Also starring Edie McClurg and Rae
Dawn Chong, and they probably prefer to omit this from their
filmographies.

In modern France, Los Guys (Cheech and Chong) is a rock band playing
horribly which forces the locals to pay them to stop. A fortune teller
(Rae Dawn Chong) tells them a story about revolutionary France. Louis
(Cheech Marin) and Lucian Corsican (Tommy Chong) are twins born to two
aristocratic fathers. Their fathers duel and both end up killed. They
are raised as peasants and find that they feel the other's pain. Louis
is raised in Mexico. He returns and the brothers run afoul of The Evil
Fuckaire. Fuckaire tries to execute the brothers but they end up
escaping while the princesses fall for them.<br><br>This is mostly unfunny. There are a couple of funny jokes but they are
not enough. Cheech and Chong work best as dumb and dumber bros. Cheech
is able to keep some of his idiocy by making his character Mexican and
dealing with societal differences. Chong is playing straight and mostly
unfunny. It would be a lot funny with the Los Guys traveling back in
time and thereby becoming fish out of water. This writing is simply not
good enough.

I enjoyed this movie more than ""Yellow Beard"", but both movies are kind
of similar as they are both period pieces and departures for the two
guys best known for their marijuana humor. Nothing of that sort is in
this movie, but I still found it relatively humorous in places. I found
it a bit funny that the hero of this one was Tommy Chong who was always
the more stoned one in the other movies. I liked the humor where if
pain is inflicted on one of the twins the other feels the pain, this
was especially good in a torture scene involving Cheech. Still, it is a
movie that probably would have been better with two other actors in the
lead roles. Nothing against Cheech and Chong, but they really do not
look like they belong in this movie. For the most part the rest of the
cast are not A-list starts, and a lot of them seem to be related to two
leads. The story is about a couple of twins that feel the others pain
going against a French ruler. Not much else to it than that. Most of
the jokes are about the shared pain, there are other jokes, but a lot
of the other jokes not related to their shared pain miss the mark.
Still the movie was mildly amusing and I thought it was better than
""Yellow Beard"" because that one had a plot that was kind of all over
the place.

If you are looking for deep plots which will draw you in and capture
your attention for an evening, and potentially leave you thinking after
the movie... this (along with everything by these two) is not your
flick. I personally enjoy and appreciate it for what it is, along with
the others. It is not a work of art or a fantastic story... but instead
an ironic view of the world.<br><br>Well... as for the movie. It (as I am sure that everyone has read)
provides two brothers of noble birth raised for some portion of their
lives as peasants and separated in youth by coincidence. The brothers
later unite 21 years later in a heartfelt moment (NOT) and assume each
other's company for the remainder of the movie. Beyond this point,
Chong utilizes his inept belligerence and desire for revolution to lead
him and his brother (Cheech) through a series of perils and near misses
which (as destiny would have it) leads to the unloading of a very
strange guy who wields the queen's power... and thus the renewal of
happiness in France in centuries past. As this alone is not enough,
each brother (from day one) carries a strange connection which enables
them to experience each other's feelings (both emotional and physical)
and not their own... a nifty sub-plot which brings about some fun irony
throughout the movie.<br><br>This is not a movie that you would wish to watch to challenge your
mind... but it is wonderful when the rigors of reality tug at you and
you wish to escape for a moment. I believe this to be true about all of
Cheech and Chong's movies... but this slight bend of taste provides new
humor not found in their all too famous stoner movies.<br><br>One final note... this (unlike others) is a decent movie to watch with
kids, although I am not sure that they will understand or appreciate
the humor as would an adult.

I just can't believe that I will ever disagree with another persons
review of a movie more than the previous persons review of The Corsican
Brothers. This movie is so hilarious that I own it, and have had the
pleasure of watching it dozens of times. In their last good movie
together, Cheech and Chong depart from the usual drug humor, and will
have you rolling (pun intended!) with laughter! Set during the French
Revolution, The Corsican Brothers is a laugh fest form beginning to
end, and is a movie that I have and will continue to recommend to
everyone that enjoys a good laugh. Anyone that could write a review
stating ""I didn't even smile once"" had to have not understood some of
the humor. Please watch this movie. You won't be disappointed.

I have seen this movie many times, and every time I finish watching it,t
he
same commentary comes into mind. Cheech and Chong are trying very hard to
make this movie funny, but they fall short of achieving that goal. The two
basically have the only funny moments in the whole movie. Besides there
Corsican Brothers, I could not get into any other character. Watch this
only
if your a big Cheech and Chong fan, or, stick to their earlier movies like
Up In Smoke, Next Movie, and Nice Dreams.

In March, 2002, after my parents and I had seen the disturbing - but
very well done - ""In the Bedroom"", we felt like we needed something
really light, so we rented ""Cheech &amp; Chong's The Corsican Brothers""; I
mean, what could be more easygoing than a movie starring filmdom's
favorite goof-ball stoners? This one turned out to be probably their
lowest movie ever. For starters, no drug humor. It features them as
siblings in pre-revolutionary France (despite the fact that they talk
like 20th century Americans) making a mess of the status quo. Much of
the little humor that the movie provides derives from the fact that if
one of them gets injured, the other feels it.<br><br>So, this is definitely not the Cheech &amp; Chong movie that I recommend.
Their other movies are far better. Also starring Edie McClurg and Rae
Dawn Chong, and they probably prefer to omit this from their
filmographies.

In modern France, Los Guys (Cheech and Chong) is a rock band playing
horribly which forces the locals to pay them to stop. A fortune teller
(Rae Dawn Chong) tells them a story about revolutionary France. Louis
(Cheech Marin) and Lucian Corsican (Tommy Chong) are twins born to two
aristocratic fathers. Their fathers duel and both end up killed. They
are raised as peasants and find that they feel the other's pain. Louis
is raised in Mexico. He returns and the brothers run afoul of The Evil
Fuckaire. Fuckaire tries to execute the brothers but they end up
escaping while the princesses fall for them.<br><br>This is mostly unfunny. There are a couple of funny jokes but they are
not enough. Cheech and Chong work best as dumb and dumber bros. Cheech
is able to keep some of his idiocy by making his character Mexican and
dealing with societal differences. Chong is playing straight and mostly
unfunny. It would be a lot funny with the Los Guys traveling back in
time and thereby becoming fish out of water. This writing is simply not
good enough.

His father was an Italian immigrant, and his mother was of Italian descent. He spoke only Italian until age five. Martin came up the hard way, with such jobs as a boxer (named Kid Crochet), a steel mill worker, a gas station worker and a casino croupier and dealer.In 1946, he got his first ticket to stardom, as he teamed up with another hard worker who was also trying to hit it big in Hollywood: Jerry Lewis. Films such as At War with the Army (1950) sent the team toward superstardom. The duo were to become one of Hollywood\'s truly great teams. They lasted 11 years together, and starred in 16 movies. They were unstoppable, but personality conflicts broke up the team. Even without Lewis, Martin was a true superstar.Few thought that Martin would go on to achieve solo success, but he did, winning critical acclaim for his role in The Young Lions (1958) with Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift, and Some Came Running (1958), with Shirley MacLaine and Frank Sinatra. Movies such as Rio Bravo (1959) brought him international fame. One of his best remembered films is in Ocean\'s Eleven (1960), in which he played Sam Harmon alongside the other members of the legendary Rat Pack: Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop and Peter Lawford. Martin proved potent at the box office throughout the 1960s, with films such as Bells Are Ringing (1960) and Robin and the 7 Hoods (1964), again with Rat Pack pals Sammy Davis Jr. and Sinatra. During much of the 1960s and 1970s, Martin\'s movie persona of a boozing playboy prompted a series of films as secret agent Matt Helm and his own television variety show. Airport (1970) followed, featuring Martin as a pilot. He also played a phony priest in The Cannonball Run (1981).In 1965, Martin explored a new method for entertaining his fans: Television. That year he hosted one of the most successful TV series in history: The Dean Martin Show (1965), which lasted until 1973. In 1965 it won a Golden Globe Award. In 1973 he renamed it ""The Dean Martin Comedy Hour"", and from 1974 to 1984 it was renamed again, this time ""The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts"". It became one of the most successful TV series in history, skewering such greats as Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Lucille Ball, James Stewart, George Burns\' Milton Berle, Don Rickles Phyllis Diller, and Joe Namath.His last public role was a return to the stage, for a cross-country concert tour with Davis and Sinatra. He spoke affectionately of his fellow Rat Packers. ""The satisfaction that I get out of working with these two bums is that we have more laughs than the audience has"", Martin said.After the 1980s, Martin took it easy--that is, until his son, Dean Paul Martin died in a plane crash in 1987. Devastated by the loss, from which he never recovered, he walked out on a reunion tour with Sinatra and Davis. Martin spent his final years in solitude. He died on Christmas Day, 1995.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Anonymous and deanmartin101          Spouse (3)               Catherine Hawn          (25 April\xa01973            - 24 February\xa01976)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)           Jeanne Martin (1 September\xa01949            - 29 March\xa01973)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(3 children)                         Elizabeth Anne McDonald          (2 October\xa01941            - 23 March\xa01949)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(4 children)          Trade Mark (3)        Cigarette and a glass of alcohol whenever he was doing his night club acts        Rich voice        Frequently worked with Jerry Lewis and members of the Rat Pack (Frank Sinatra, Joey Bishop, Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr.)Trivia (60)      His son, Dean Paul Martin (Dino), was killed in a plane crash in March 1987.      Member of the ""Rat Pack"" with Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop. All appeared in Ocean\'s Eleven (1960).      Father of Gail Martin, Craig Martin, Claudia Martin, Deana Martin Gina Martin, Ricci Martin and Dean Paul Martin.      Grandfather of Alexander Martin.      Born at 11:55pm-CST      Interred at Westwood Memorial Park, Los Angeles, California, USA.      His parents were Gaetano and Angella Crocetti. Although born in Ohio, he spoke only Italian until age 5.      He had a fear of elevators and a love of comic books, which he read his entire life.      His career as a boxer was described by him as follows, ""I won all but 11 fights."" When asked how many he\'d fought, he\'d reply, ""A dozen."" In reality, he fought 36 bouts and won 25 of them under the name Dino Crocetti. He reportedly fought under the nickname Kid Crochet, although no records of fights have been found under that name.      Died exactly 29 years to the day (25 December 1995) after his mother, Angela Crocetti (25 December 1966).      Nephew of actor/comedian Leonard Barr.      Much of the ""booze"" that he drank on stage during his famous ""Rat Pack"" performances was really apple juice. (Son Dean Paul Martin spilled this secret, after the variety show ended production, stating that his father couldn\'t have performed if he\'d really drunk that much liquor.)      Father in law of Carole Costello. She was married to Craig Martin, his oldest son & was the daughter of Lou Costello.      From 1973 to 1984, he was the host of the ""Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts."" In one of the most classic television series of all time, Dean and his panel of actors and comics would shower the guest of honor with insults. This series contained the most famous names in the history of entertainment, such as Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Lucille Ball, George Burns, James Stewart, Orson Welles, Jack Benny, Phyllis Diller, Milton Berle, Gene Kelly, Don Rickles, Rich Little, John Wayne, and Foster Brooks.      Dean\'s TV career began in 1950 with The Martin & Lewis Show on The Colgate Comedy Hour, which ran through 1955. He hosted various other shows before reluctantly taking the 1965 gig which turned into a 19-year success under various names.      Dean is one of few actors who have received not just one, but three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for Motion Pictures at 6519 Hollywood Blvd., one for Television at 6651 Hollywood Blvd, and a third for his recording career.      Underwent rhinoplasty when he was 27. The procedure was rumored to have been paid for by Lou Costello among others.      Son-in-law was the late Carl Wilson of The Beach Boys (married to Dean\'s daughter Gina).      Has a street named after him in San Antonio, Texas.      ""Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime"" - words written on his tombstone, after his signature hit.      Starred (with Jerry Lewis) on NBC Radio\'s ""The Martin and Lewis Show"" (1949-1953).      He and Frank Sinatra were best friends, a fact he held very dear to his heart. The two didn\'t speak much, in the years after Dean quit the ""Rat Pack Reunion"" tour, but they did reconcile a few months before his death, over dinner - and a breadroll fight.      His friends often described him as easygoing and good natured, loving to laugh and make others laugh. They also said that he was sometimes quiet and liked to spend time alone, and that they seldom knew what he was thinking.      He and former wife Jeanne Martin maintained a friendship after their divorce, and consulted each other on family matters. When his health declined, Jeanne encouraged him not to worry about facing death, and to look at it as the chance he longed for, to be reunited with their son Dean Paul Martin, and with his parents.      His style of singing was initially influenced by Harry Mills of The Mills Brothers.      When 20th Century-Fox fired Marilyn Monroe as his co-star in Something\'s Got to Give (1962) and then attempted to replace her with Lee Remick, he reminded the studio that he had contractual approval of his co-star, and refused to continue the project without Monroe. His act of loyalty eventually got Marilyn re-hired, but she died of a drug overdose before shooting on this never-finished film could resume. Nine hours of largely unseen footage from the film remained in the vaults at 20th Century Fox until 1999. The film was then edited to include some of the unseen footage,wherever feasible and digitally restored, as a 37 minute film. After 39 years, The film finally premiered on Cable TV\'s ""American Movie Classics"", on June 1, 2001. It is available on DVD.      Although he had almost 40 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 charts between 1951 and 1968, only three went to number one: ""That\'s Amore"" (Capitol: 1953), ""Memories Are Made of This"" (Capitol: 1956), and his theme song, ""Everybody Loves Somebody"" (Reprise: 1964).      Despite the legend that he and comedy partner Jerry Lewis always despised each other, the two were actually quite close friends and the tension between the two began in 1956, when ""outside people"" (as Lewis called them to Peter Bogdanovich) began to ""poison"" Martin against Lewis. Frank Sinatra eventually staged a public reunion over 20 years after, during a 1976 MDA telethon that Jerry was hosting. However they did reunite twice, briefly, during that 20 year hiatus. In 1958, they appeared together as surprise guests on ""The Joey Bishop Show"" and in 1960, they appeared together on stage at ""The Sands"" in Las Vegas where they did a duet of ""Come Back To Me"". Over the next 10 years, following their 70s reunion, they became close again.      He and the other members of the Rat Pack were banned from Marilyn Monroe\'s funeral by Joe DiMaggio      Following his diagnosis of lung cancer at Cedars Sinai Medical Center on 16 September 1993, Martin finally quit smoking and even managed to perform briefly, and rather jauntily, at his 77th birthday celebration in June 1994. He declined to have major surgery on his liver and kidneys which doctors told him was necessary to prolong his life, and succumbed to respiratory failure on Christmas Day 1995.      He and Jerry Lewis, in1954, recorded a radio spot promoting ""Tuck Tape"" then a competing brand of ""Scotch Tape and noticing the recording tape for the commercial was still rolling, decided to improvise additional radio spots, with Jerry and Dean slipping profanities into his dialog. The unedited master recording was surreptitiously taken from the studio and made into a ""bootleg"" record that sold briskly among collectors.      Although Martin was a Republican, he supported Frank Sinatra\'s campaign to elect John F. Kennedy as President in 1960.      Had a night-club in North Bay Village, Florida in the late 1970s and early 1980s called Dino\'s. It was next to Jilly Rizzo\'s club, Jilly\'s.      He declined to participate in the March on Washington in August 1963.      Dean was so distraught over the murder of his The Wrecking Crew (1968) co-star and friend Sharon Tate that he abandoned the next already-announced ""Matt Helm"" motion picture series installment (to be titled ""The Ravagers""), and never played the character again.      Although he made out to be a heavy drinker on stage, he mostly used apple juice, but off stage was a Jack Daniels man.      Martin did not party all night with the rest of the ""Rat Pack"" crew - actually calling themselves ""The Clan"". He usually went to bed early so he could play golf the next morning. He was obsessed with golf, and once stated in an interview that he would have preferred to be a professional golfer than an entertainer.      He was a close friend of John Wayne and Gary Cooper.      At 16, Dean Martin was a welterweight boxer who compiled a record of 25-11.      One of his favorite hobbies during his reclusive final years was watching westerns on television - the older the better.      In 1962, Martin left Capitol Records and signed with Reprise, the label started and owned by Frank Sinatra. In 1964, he recorded his blockbuster hit, ""Everybody Loves Somebody"", which beat the Beatles to become the No. 1 hit in America for one week. It became the theme song for his television variety series, The Dean Martin Show (1965), which ran on NBC for eight years. Martin followed this with The Dean Martin Comedy World (1974), which ran from 1973 to 1974. An indelible part of Martin\'s television shtick was his comedic portrayal of life as a lush, which many viewers never realized was just an act.      After being drafted into the United States Army and serving a stateside year (1944-1945) in Akron, Ohio, during World War II, Martin was classified 4-F and was discharged.      Has 8 children: Stephen Craig Martin (b. June 29th 1942), Claudia Martin (b. March 16th 1944 - died 2001 (breast cancer), Barbara Martin (b. April 11th 1945 and Deana Martin (b. August 19th 1948) with first wife Elizabeth McDonald. Dean Paul Martin (b. November 17th 1951 - died March 21st 1987 (plane crash), Ricci Martin (b. September 20th 1953) and Gina Caroline Martin (b. December 20th 1956) with second wife Jeanne Martin and adopted daughter Sasha Martin with third wife Catherine Hawn.      He was a close friend of Montgomery Clift. Martin was always grateful for the help Clift had given him while filming The Young Lions (1958) - Martin\'s first major dramatic role - and he would accompany him to parties after the rest of Hollywood had disowned him due to his increasing addictions to drugs and alcohol.      Although Jerry Lewis was often made out to be the short guy in their act, he was actually the same height as Martin and used to cut the heel off of his shoe to achieve the effect.      Martin\'s variety show contract was utterly remarkable in how little he was required to participate. Martin felt he performed better cold and took notice of Fred MacMurray\'s long-standing 65-day ""on the set"" contract for producer Don Fedderson for My Three Sons. He succeeded in reaching a new plateau on that one by only be contractually required to appear on the set during the taping. All guest stars, no matter how ""big"" were required to rehearse with stand-ins (see Greg Garrison). As a result, Martin would often happily flub his lines, to the delight of his audience. More often than not, he\'d leave the stage and be seen driving off the studio lot in his sports car before taping concluded.      He was awarded 3 Stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Motion Pictures at 6519 Hollywood Boulevard, for Recording at 1617 Vine Street, and for Television at 6651 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California.      Godfather of Tori Spelling.      Once employed as a steelworker.      Was a close friend of Julie London.      Inducted into the Lou Holtz/Upper Ohio Valley Hall of Fame in 2001.      Although Martin\'s official height was 5\'11"", many people who knew him said he wore lifts and his real height was either 5\'8"" or 5\'9"".      Growing up in Steubenville, Ohio, Martin was childhood friends with famed gambler and sports handicapper, Jimmy ""The Greek"" Snyder. (The two appeared together onscreen in ""The Cannonball Run"") Like Snyder, Martin began his early career hanging around Steubenville\'s notorious gambling dens.      His third wife Cathy was the daughter of Major League Baseball Player Jim Baxes, and sister of James Coleman.      In a telegram sent to his friend Elivis Presley he wrote: Dear Elvis, if you can\'t handle The Beatles, I\'ll do it for us. June 1964.      Was also a newspaper carrier in his younger days.      In his 1995 autobiography ""In the Arena"" Charlton Heston wrote that Frank Sinatra would not allow Martin to perform at the inaugural ball for Ronald Reagan\'s first inauguration as President of the United States, because Martin was too drunk.      He usually wore lifts in films and on his television show.      In 1962, he recorded an American version of the French song ""C\'est si bon"" which was written in 1947 by Henri Betti (music) and André Hornez (lyrics). The musical arrangements were done by Neal Hefti and the English lyrics were written by Jerry Seelen in 1950.      A major supporter of the state of Israel, Martin performed concerts to raise funds for the Bergson Group.Personal Quotes (25)      If people want to think I get drunk and stay out all night, let \'em.

He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to Ann Harriet (Gunderson), a Norwegian immigrant, and James Thomas Mitchum, a shipyard/railroad worker. His father died in a train accident when he was two, and Robert and his siblings (including brother John Mitchum, later also an actor) were raised by his mother and stepfather (a British army major) in Connecticut, New York, and Delaware. An early contempt for authority led to discipline problems, and Mitchum spent good portions of his teen years adventuring on the open road. On one of these trips, at the age of 14, he was charged with vagrancy and sentenced to a Georgia chain gang, from which he escaped. Working a wide variety of jobs (including ghostwriter for astrologist Carroll Righter), Mitchum discovered acting in a Long Beach, California, amateur theater company. He worked at Lockheed Aircraft, where job stress caused him to suffer temporary blindness. About this time he began to obtain small roles in films, appearing in dozens within a very brief time. In 1945, he was cast as Lt. Walker in Story of G.I. Joe (1945) and received an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actor. His star ascended rapidly, and he became an icon of 1940s film noir, though equally adept at westerns and romantic dramas. His apparently lazy style and seen-it-all demeanor proved highly attractive to men and women, and by the 1950s, he was a true superstar despite a brief prison term for marijuana usage in 1949, which seemed to enhance rather than diminish his ""bad boy"" appeal. Though seemingly dismissive of ""art,"" he worked in tremendously artistically thoughtful projects such as Charles Laughton\'s The Night of the Hunter (1955) and even co-wrote and composed an oratorio produced at the Hollywood Bowl by Orson Welles. A master of accents and seemingly unconcerned about his star image, he played in both forgettable and unforgettable films with unswerving nonchalance, leading many to overlook the prodigious talent he can bring to a project that he finds compelling. He moved into television in the 1980s as his film opportunities diminished, winning new fans with The Winds of War (1983) and War and Remembrance (1988). His sons James Mitchum and Christopher Mitchum are actors, as is his grandson Bentley Mitchum. His last film was James Dean: Live Fast, Die Young (1997) with Casper Van Dien as James Dean.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Jim Beaver < jumblejim@prodigy.net>          Spouse (1) Dorothy Mitchum (15 March\xa01940            - 1 July\xa01997)\xa0(his death)\xa0(3 children)          Trade Mark (4)        On and off-screen, he was known for his facade of cool, sleepy-eyed indifference        Deep, commanding, yet lively voice        Dimpled chin        Often played loners and driftersTrivia (73)      Father of James Mitchum, Christopher Mitchum, and Trini Mitchum.      Brother of John Mitchum and Julie Mitchum.      Grandfather of actors Bentley Mitchum and Price Mitchum, actress Carrie Mitchum and male model Kian Mitchum.      Sidelines: Played the saxophone and wrote poetry.      In 1947, he and Gary Gray recorded the songs from Rachel and the Stranger (1948) for Delta Records\' soundtrack album. In 1968, he recorded another album, entitled ""That Man Robert Mitchum... Sings"". It included the track ""Little Old Wine Drinker Me"", which later became a hit for Dean Martin. In 1998, these songs were released on CD as ""Robert Mitchum Sings"".      Briefly served in the United States Army during World War II, with service number 39 744 068, from April 12 - October 11, 1945, after he was drafted. According to Lee Server\'s 2001 biography, ""Robert Mitchum: Baby I Don\'t Care"", Mitchum said he served as a medic at an induction department, checking recruits\' genitals for venereal disease (a ""pecker checker""). Always the iconoclast, although he did not want to join the military, he served honorably and was discharged as a Private First Class and received the World War II Victory Medal.      Was one of four actors (with Jack Nicholson, Bette Davis, and Faye Dunaway) to have two villainous roles ranked in the American Film Institute\'s 100 years of The Greatest Heroes and Villains, as Max Cady in Cape Fear (1962) at #28 and as Reverend Harry Powell in The Night of the Hunter (1955) at #29.      He was accused of anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial after an interview he gave to Barry Rehfeld of ""Esquire"" magazine promoting The Winds of War (1983) at his home in February 1983. Mitchum wrote an apologetic letter on 9 March 1983 to Herbert Luft, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency\'s Hollywood columnist. Mitchum claimed he had recited views expressed by the bigoted football coach he had played in That Championship Season (1982), which Rehfeld ""mistakenly believed to be my own. From that point on, he approached me as the character in the script and in playing the devil\'s advocate in a prankish attempt to string him along we compounded a tragedy of errors."" Mitchum added he was ""truly sorry that this misunderstanding has upset so many people, especially since it is so foreign to my principle. The attendant misfortune is that it has brought me a spate of mail from people and organizations who are encouraged to believe that I share their bigotry and discrimination."".      Carefully maintained a facade of indifference, always lazily insisting that he made movies just so he could get laid, score some pot, and make money, and cared nothing about art. This is surely true of some films, which he likely picked to make money, but certain directors and films seemed to secretly pique his interest, including his work with Charles Laughton, John Huston and Howard Hawks.      He was voted the 61st Greatest Movie Star of all time by Entertainment Weekly.      Was mentioned by name as part of The Velvet Underground song ""New Age"" (from the 1970 album ""Loaded"").      In the 1950s, he was selected by Howard Hughes to appear in a series of films he was producing. Hughes considered Mitchum a ""friend,"" but (as a paranoid recluse) hardly met the actor. Mitchum was halfway put off and halfway amused by the ""crazy old man"" and clearly saw that he was a surrogate for Hughes as the strapping actor ""romanced"" young starlets on screen.Michael Madsen called Mitchum his ""role model"" and inspiration to take up acting as a profession.      Was close friends with Richard Egan, and served as a pallbearer at his funeral in 1987.      Was named #23 greatest actor on The 50 Greatest Screen Legends by the American Film Institute.      Great-grandfather of Allexanne Mitchum, Cappy Van Dien and Grace Van Dien.      Turned down the lead role of Gen. George S. Patton in Patton (1970), allegedly because he believed he would ruin the film due to his indifference. During a Turner Classic Movies interview with Robert Osborne, Mitchum said that he knew the movie could be a great one due to the script, but that the studio would want to concentrate on battles and tanks moving around on screen rather than on the character of Patton. Mitchum believed that with himself in the role, the movie would turn out mediocre; what was needed was a passionate actor who would fight his corner to keep the focus on Patton, an actor like George C. Scott, whom Mitchum recommended to the producers.      Treated for alcoholism at the Betty Ford Center in 1984.      Died one day before his The Big Sleep (1978) co-star James Stewart.      Biography in: ""American National Biography."" Supplement 1, pp. 414-416. New York: Oxford University Press, 2002.      Although he had numerous affairs throughout his marriage, he remained with wife Dorothy Mitchum for nearly 60 years.      Addressed the Republican National Convention in 1992.      Robert\'s father, James Thomas Mitchum, was born in Lane, Williamsburg, South Carolina. James had English ancestry. Robert\'s mother, Ann Harriet (Gunderson), was Norwegian, from Kristiania, Oslo, Norway. Robert is sometimes described as having Native American ancestry on his father\'s side. It is not clear if this ancestry has been verified/documented.      He was cremated and his ashes scattered at sea by wife Dorothy Mitchum and neighbor Jane Russell. At Mitchum\'s insistence, no memorial service was held.      His driving license from 1950 gave his height as 6\' even, one inch less than usually reported. However, Mitchum described himself as being exactly six feet tall in interviews.      His vocal support for the Vietnam War failed to affect his appeal with American youth, and in 1968, a poll of teenagers declared him the coolest celebrity. Mitchum responded that they must have missed his recent films.      During a break in filming War and Remembrance (1988) in August 1987, Mitchum replaced his friend John Huston as an aging millionaire in Mr. North (1988) after Huston, who suffered from emphysema, was hospitalized with pneumonia. In October 1987, Mitchum filled in for Edward Woodward, who was recovering from a heart attack, in a special two-part episode of The Equalizer (1985).      His arrest for marijuana possession in the late 1940s was one of the first times a major actor had been jailed for this crime. According to Lee Server\'s 2001 biography, ""Robert Mitchum: Baby I Don\'t Care"", he was still smoking pot into his old age.      Was the defendant in FTC (Federal Taxation Commissioner) vs. Mitchum (1965), a famous taxation case in Australia, in relation to income earned in Australia while working there on The Sundowners (1960).      He was a huge fan of Elvis Presley\'s early music, and wanted Presley to star with him in Thunder Road (1958). Unfortunately, Tom Parker\'s demands for Presley\'s salary could not be met in this independent production, which Mitchum was financing himself.      In 1981, he fired his secretary, Reva Frederick, when he closed his office. Mitchum was subsequently sued as she claimed he owed her a pension back-dated to 1961. There was no paperwork to support this claim, and she dropped her suit when evidence was discovered that she had stolen millions of dollars from Mitchum over the years. As part of the ""deal"", he agreed not to prosecute. During the course of these events, Ms. Fredrick suffered a stroke from which she never fully recovered.      He was persuaded by his manager Antonio Consentino, a die-hard Republican, to campaign for George Bush in the 1992 presidential election. He also narrated a biographical film of the President for the Republican National Convention, and attended a fundraiser at Bob Hope\'s house in Hollywood.      His performance as Reverend Harry Powell in The Night of the Hunter (1955) is ranked #71 on Premiere magazine\'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.      Mitchum once said that Reverend Harry Powell, the murderous villain he played in The Night of the Hunter (1955), was his favorite role.      He seriously considered retiring from acting in 1968 due to concerns over the quality of his recent movies. After a year\'s absence, during which he spent much of the time driving around America visiting old friends and staying in motels, he was lured back to star in Ryan\'s Daughter (1970).      Visited his son Christopher Mitchum on the set of Rio Lobo (1970). Director Howard Hawks asked the elder Mitchum to reprise his El Dorado (1967) role as a drunken sheriff, but Mitchum claimed he was now retired. John Wayne responded, ""Mitch has been retiring ever since the first day I met him."".      He was fired from Blood Alley (1955), allegedly for getting drunk and arguing with a crew member whom he then proceeded to throw into a nearby river, a charge Mitchum always denied.      Turned down the leading role in Sam Peckinpah\'s masterpiece The Wild Bunch (1969), which went to his old friend William Holden, and made 5 Card Stud (1968). His excuse was they were both westerns.5 Card Stud (1968), the showdown between Hollywood\'s two deities of indifference, produced no sparks on or off the screen. Dean Martin remained in his trailer watching television after filming was completed, and delivered his lines as though he had memorized them phonetically. The only excitement came when a massive camera collapsed and nearly hammered Mitchum into the ground. Instead, the star moved casually aside while thousands of dollars worth of equipment smashed around him.      Had a longstanding dislike of fellow tough guy actors Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson.      President Dwight D. Eisenhower would never allow any of Mitchum\'s movies to be played in the White House, due to the actor\'s marijuana possession conviction.      Replaced Burt Lancaster in Maria\'s Lovers (1984) after the elder actor was forced to undergo emergency quadruple heart bypass surgery.      After two weeks of shooting on the movie Tombstone (1993), the studio fired writer (director) Kevin Jarre and hired George P. Cosmatos. He, with Kurt Russell\'s input, cut a number of scenes (for actors) and changed them to new action scenes, weakening a beautifully written script. Part of what was cut was the old man Ike\'s character. As Mitchum had already signed the contract, they had him do the voice-over instead.      Though respectful of Robert De Niro\'s talent, Mitchum was amused by the young Method actor\'s habit of remaining in character all day as film studio chief Monroe Stahr during the filming of The Last Tycoon (1976). Mitchum gave De Niro the nickname ""Kid Monroe"", and made many jokes about him with the older actors on the set like Ray Milland and Dana Andrews.      Many critics were unconvinced by the 65-year-old Mitchum winning World War II in The Winds of War (1983). When the producers made a sequel, War and Remembrance (1988), they worried that a 70-year-old Mitchum would be even less convincing and considered replacing him with James Coburn. Eventually they decided that what they would gain in fewer wrinkles, they would lose in Mitchum\'s formidable screen presence and charisma.      Presented with a People\'s Choice Award backstage by Charlton Heston for War and Remembrance (1988) during the 1989 ceremony in Beverly Hills, California.      Turned down Gene Hackman\'s role as drug-busting policeman Popeye Doyle in The French Connection (1971) because he found the story offensive.      While filming El Dorado (1967) Mitchum was amused by co-star John Wayne\'s attempts to play his screen persona to the hilt in real life. He recalled that Wayne wore four-inch lifts to increase his height and had the roof of his car raised so he could drive wearing his Stetson.      Mitchum was in poor health while filming The Winds of War (1983), and once again there was talk of retirement. He filmed Maria\'s Lovers (1984) despite suffering from a solid case of pneumonia.      He claimed his famous eyes were the result of a combination of injuries from his boxing days and chronic insomnia, which he suffered from throughout his life.      In 1959, the Mitchums moved out of Hollywood and into a farm they had bought on the Maryland shore of Chesapeake Bay, near the town of Trappe. In 1965, the family returned to Hollywood, largely at wife Dorothy Mitchum\'s insistence, and moved into a modest, ivy-covered mansion in Bel Air. Mitchum also purchased a 76-acre ranch near Los Angeles, mostly as a home for his growing collection of quarter horses.      The 60-year-old Mitchum impressed Oliver Reed, Britain\'s legendary hellraiser, by drinking a whole bottle of gin in 55 minutes on the set of The Big Sleep (1978).      Is mentioned in the Queens of the Stone Age song ""The Fun Machine Took a Shit and Died"", off their 2007 album ""Era Vulgaris"".      Early in his career many newspapers and fan magazines promoted him as a ""new"" Clark Gable, perhaps because both actors had strongly masculine images and powerful, distinctive voices. With Out of the Past (1947) however, Mitchum proved that he was a great star in his own right.      Was mentioned in the song ""One More Arrow"" by Elton John.      Was the inspiration for the Kurt Busiek\'s Astro City character ""Steeljack"".      Is the subject of the song ""Robert Mitchum"" by Swedish singer Olle Ljungström, available on his album ""Världens Räddaste Man"" (translates ""The World\'s Most Terrified Man"").      Mitchum was cast by Howard Hughes in Holiday Affair (1949) because Hughes felt that Mitchum needed to ""soften"" his image after his marijuana conviction and prison sentence.      Turned down the role that eventually went to Tony Curtis in The Defiant Ones (1958). Mitchum, a real-life veteran of a Southern chain gang, did not believe the premise that a black man and a white man would be chained together and said that such a thing would never happen in the South. Over the years, this reason was corrupted to the point where many people now believe Mitchum turned down the role because he did not want to be chained to a black man, an absolute falsehood. Curtis repeated the inaccurate story in his autobiography, but later recanted after Mitchum\'s real reason was explained to him.      Dwight Whitney wrote in ""TV Guide"" on June 7, 1969 about Mitchum that there is the ""suggestion, implicit in every utterance, that within the body of this \'movie-star\' lies imprisoned the soul of a poet."".      According to Mitchum biographer John Belton, during the shooting of Undercurrent (1946) Katharine Hepburn told Mitchum, ""You know you can\'t act, and if you hadn\'t been good-looking, you would have never gotten a picture. I\'m tired of playing with people who have nothing to offer."".      As a teenager, Mitchum was sentenced to a Georgia chain gang on a charge of vagrancy.      Was announced as co star with Spencer Tracy and Paul Newman in the Jerry Wald production of ""The Enemy Within"", based on the book by Attorney General Robert Kennedy, which at 1962/63 was in preparation for Twentieth Century Fox.      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6240 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on January 25, 1984.      As of November 2013, Mitchum remains the subject of a documentary, still in progress after some 20 years, by Bruce Weber, which was screened at the Venice Film Festival in August 2013.      While at RKO Radio Pictures, Mitchum became the first male movie star to refuse to shave his chest for shirtless roles. In order to avoid that, he allowed himself to develop a pot belly to avoid having to take his shirt off at all.      Mitchum refused to be interviewed for George Eells\' biography of the actor.      In 1975 he was offered his high school diploma if he attended a ceremony at his old school. Mitchum did not attend the ceremony, but the diploma was still posted to him.      Became good friends with legendary animal trainer Ralph Helfer\'s famous African Lion Zamba while filming the movie Rampage (1963).      One of the lesser-known aspects of Mitchum\'s career were his forays into music, both as singer and composer. Critic Greg Adams writes that ""Unlike most celebrity vocalists, Robert Mitchum actually had musical talent."" Mitchum\'s voice was often used instead of that of a professional singer when his character sang in his films. Notable productions featuring Mitchum\'s own singing voice included Rachel and the Stranger (1948), River of No Return (1954) and The Night of the Hunter (1955). After hearing traditional calypso music and meeting artists such as Mighty Sparrow and Lord Invader while filming Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison (1957) in the Caribbean island of Tobago, he recorded Calypso - is like so... in 1957. On the album, he emulated the calypso sound and style, even adopting the style\'s unique pronunciations and slang. A year later, he recorded a song he had written for the film Thunder Road (1958), titled ""The Ballad of Thunder Road"". The country-style song became a modest hit for Mitchum, reaching No. 69 on the Billboard Pop Singles Chart. The song was included as a bonus track on a successful reissue of Calypso... and helped market the film to a wider audience.      Was said to have been a candidate for the role of Samson in Samson and Delilah (1949).      Mitchum wrote an oratorio that was produced and directed by Orson Welles at the Hollywood Bowl in the 1940s.      In his 1973 autobiography ""Anything for a Quiet Life"" Jack Hawkins wrote that Mitchum would drink 49 glasses of rum before having dinner when they were filming Rampage (1963).Personal Quotes (56)      The only difference between me and my fellow actors is that I\'ve spent more time in jail.      I gave up being serious about making pictures around the time I made a film with Greer Garson and she took a hundred and twenty-five takes to say no.      I started out to be a sex fiend but couldn\'t pass the physical.      Movies bore me; especially my own.      I\'ve still got the same attitude I had when I started. I haven\'t changed anything but my underwear.      [on his acting talents] Listen. I got three expressions: looking left, looking right and looking straight ahead.      People think I have an interesting walk. Hell, I\'m just trying to hold my gut in.      [on press stories] They\'re all true - booze, brawls, broads, all true. Make up some more if you want to.      When I drop dead and they rush to the drawer, there\'s going to be nothing in it but a note saying \'later\'.      I never take any notice of reviews - unless a critic has thought up some new way of describing me. That old one about my lizard eyes and anteater nose and the way I sleep my way through pictures is so hackneyed now.      Years ago, I saved up a million dollars from acting, a lot of money in those days, and I spent it all on a horse farm in Tucson. Now when I go down there, I look at that place and I realize my whole acting career adds up to a million dollars worth of horse shit.      I have two acting styles: with and without a horse.      Every two or three years, I knock off for a while. That way I\'m always the new girl in the whorehouse.      I never changed anything, except my socks and my underwear. And I never did anything to glorify myself or improve my lot. I took what came and did the best I could with it.      [asked what jail was like, after being released on a marijuana possession charge] It\'s like Palm Springs without the riff-raff.      You\'ve got to realize that a Steve McQueen performance lends itself to monotony.      Not that I\'m a complete whore, understand. There are movies I won\'t do for any amount. I turned down Patton (1970) and I turned down Dirty Harry (1971). Movies that piss on the world. If I\'ve got five bucks in my pocket, I don\'t need to make money that f***ing way, daddy.John Wayne had four-inch lifts in his shoes. He had the overheads on his boat accommodated to fit him. He had a special roof put in his station wagon. The son-of-a-bitch, they probably buried him in his goddamn lifts.      There just isn\'t any pleasing some people. The trick is to stop trying.      [his opinion about the Vietnam war, in 1968] If they won\'t listen to reason over there, just kill \'em. Nuke \'em all.      Sure I was glad to see John Wayne win the Oscar. I\'m always glad to see the fat lady win the Cadillac on television, too.      I\'ve survived because I work cheap and don\'t take up too much time.      You know what the average Robert Mitchum fan is? He\'s full of warts and dandruff and he\'s probably got a hernia too, but he sees me up there on the screen and he thinks if that bum can make it, I can be president.      I kept the same suit for six years - and the same dialog. We just changed the title of the picture and the leading lady.      I came back from the war and ugly heroes were in.      Young actors love me. They think if that big slob can make it, there\'s a chance for us.      [asked why, in his mid-60s, he took on the arduous task of an 18-hour mini-series, The Winds of War (1983)] It promised a year of free lunches.      How do I keep fit? I lay down a lot.      [on four-time co-star Deborah Kerr] The best, my favorite... Life would be kind if I could live it with Deborah around.      [his opinion of Method actors Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Jack Nicholson] They are all small.      [1983] Stars today are just masturbation images.      [on The Good Guys and the Bad Guys (1969)] How the hell did I get into this picture anyway? I kept reading in the papers that I was going to do it, but when they sent me the script I just tossed it on the heap with the rest of them. But somehow, one Monday morning, here I was. How the hell do these things happen to a man?      Just after we shot Secret Ceremony (1968), lesbianism came in... I\'m no damned good as a lesbian.      People make too much of acting. You are not helping anyone like being a doctor or even a musician. In the final analysis, you have exalted no one but yourself.      These kids only want to talk about acting method and motivation; in my day all we talked about was screwing and overtime.      I know production values are better, but are the scripts, are the pictures? The thing is, it\'s a hell of a lot more work, and I don\'t see overall where the films are any better, really?      I often regret my good reviews, because there is no point in doing something I know to be inferior and then I find I have come off the best in the film. Wouldn\'t you find that worrying?      [1948] I never will believe there is such a thing as a great actor.      I got a great life out of the movies. I\'ve been all over the world and met the most fantastic people. I don\'t really deserve all I\'ve gotten. It\'s a privileged life, and I know it.      Sometimes, I think I ought to go back and do at least one thing really well. But again, indolence will probably cause me to hesitate about finding a place to start. Part of that indolence perhaps is due to shyness because I\'m a natural hermit. I\'ve been in constant motion of escape all my life. I never really found the right corner to hide in.      Up there on the screen you\'re thirty feet wide, your eyeball is six feet high, but it doesn\'t mean that you really amount to anything or have anything important to say.      [1967] Where are the real artists? Today it\'s four-barreled carburetors and that\'s it.      [1968] The Rin Tin Tin method is good enough for me. That dog never worried about motivation or concepts and all that junk.      I only read the reviews of my films if they\'re amusing. Six books have been written about me but I\'ve only met two of the authors. They get my name and birthplace wrong in the first paragraph. From there it\'s all downhill.      [on working with Faye Dunaway] When I got here I walked in thinking I was a star and then I found I was supposed to do everything the way she says. Listen, I\'m not going to take any temperamental whims from anyone, I just take a long walk and cool off. If I didn\'t do that, I know I\'d wind up dumping her on her derrière.      [on Sarah Miles] She\'s a monster. If you think she\'s not strong, you\'d better pay attention.      [asked what he looks for in a script before accepting a job] Days off.      [on Steve McQueen] He sure don\'t bring much brains to the party, that kid.      [on Jane Russell] Miss Russell was a very strong character. Very good-humored when she wasn\'t being cranky.      They think I don\'t know my lines. That\'s not true. I\'m just too drunk to say \'em.      They could never decide to their satisfaction what type I was. One would say, ""He\'s a heart-broken Byronic."" Another would say, ""No, he ain\'t; he\'s an all-American boy."" People began talking about Mitchum-type roles, but I still don\'t know what they mean. They\'d paint eyes on my eyelids, man, and I\'d walk through it.      RKO made the same film with me for ten years. They were so alike I wore the same suit in six of them and the same Burberry trench coat. They made a male Jane Russell out of me. I was the staff hero. They got so they wanted me to take some of my clothes off in the pictures. I objected to this, so I put on some weight and looked like a Bulgarian wrestler when I took my shirt off. Only two pictures in that time made any sense whatever. I complained and they told me frankly that they had a certain amount of baloney to sell and I was the boy to do it.      I worked three pictures for 28 days straight. We\'d shoot all night at RKO [The Locket (1946)], then I\'d report to Undercurrent (1946) from seven in the morning until noon, when I\'d be flown to Monterey to work all afternoon with Greer Garson [Desire Me (1947)].      I get along with people very well, really. I do. I do. Really. Every now and then, some guy gets the hots and figures to go home and tell his old lady he just decked that motherfucker Mitchum. Why, she\'ll shoot him, man! ""Robert Mitchum? You stomped his ass? Why, you dirty motherfucker!"" Me, I\'m easy. I don\'t go through red lights. I don\'t steal.      The single thing I\'m grateful for that\'s come out of the whole [Vietnam] war mess has been the recognition of the need for communication. I\'ve gone sometimes on dangerous waters in the interest of communication because I believe in it. I believe that everyone in the world should at least have the privilege of knowing what\'s happening all at the same time. One thing I\'ve learned is that the greatest fuckin\' slavery is ignorance, and the biggest commodity is ignorance -- the dissemination of ignorance, the sale and burgeoning marketing of ignorance.      No, I don\'t identify in my mind with criminals, but my exposure to them has helped my understanding. Oh, sure, sure, sure, sure. Sure. I know the freakers, you know -- the burglars, the uptighters, those creeps who puke or jerk off or something every time they make a score, so you can pick up on their modus operandi.Salary (20)Hoppy Serves a Writ\xa0(1943)      $100 /week      Aerial Gunner\xa0(1943)      $75 /day      Border Patrol\xa0(1943)      $100 /week      Minesweeper\xa0(1943)      $75 /day      Story of G.I.

Yet on April 30, 1970, at only 35, Inger Stevens would become another tragic Hollywood statistic -- added proof that fame and fortune do not always lead to happiness. Over time, a curious fascination, and perhaps even a morbid interest, has developed over Ms. Stevens and her life. What exactly went wrong? A remote, paradoxical young lady with obvious personal problems, she disguised it all with a seemingly positive attitude, an incredibly healthy figure and a megawatt smile that wouldn\'t quit. Although very little information has been filtered out about Ms. Stevens and her secretive life over the years, William T. Patterson\'s eagerly-anticipated biography, ""The Farmer\'s Daughter Remembered: The Biography of Actress Inger Stevens"" (2000), finally put an end to much of the mystery. But not quite all. The book claims that a large amount of previously-published information about Ms. Stevens is either untrue or distorted.A strong talent and consummate dramatic player of the late 50s and 60s, she was born Inger Stensland, the eldest of three children, of Swedish parentage. A painfully shy and sensitive child, she was initially drawn to acting as a girl after witnessing her father perform in amateur theater productions. Her rather bleak childhood could be directed at a mother who abandoned her family for another man when Inger was only 6. Her father moved to the States, remarried, and eventually summoned for Inger and a younger brother in 1944 to join him and his new bride. Family relations did not improve. As a teenager, she ran away from home and ended up in a burlesque chorus line only to be brought home by her father. After graduation and following some menial jobs here and there, she moved to New York and worked briefly as a model while studying at the Actors Studio. She broke into the business through TV commercials and summer stock, rising in the ingénue ranks as a guest in a number of weekly series.Often viewed as the beautiful loner or lady of mystery, an innate sadness seemed to permeate many of her roles. Inger made her film debut at age 22 opposite Bing Crosby in Man on Fire (1957). Serious problems set in when Inger began falling in love with her co-stars. Broken affairs with Crosby, James Mason, her co-star in Cry Terror! (1958), Anthony Quinn, her director in Cecil B. DeMille\'s The Buccaneer (1958), and Harry Belafonte, her co-star in The World, the Flesh and the Devil (1959), left her frequently depressed and ultimately despondent. An almost-fatal New Year\'s day suicide attempt in 1959 led to an intense period of self-examination and a new resolve. A brief Broadway lead in ""Roman Candle"", an Emmy-nominated role opposite Peter Falk in The Dick Powell Show: Price of Tomatoes (1962), and popular appearances on such TV shows as Bonanza (1959), The Twilight Zone (1959) and Route 66 (1960) paved the way to a popular series as ""Katy Holstrum"", the Swedish governess, in The Farmer\'s Daughter (1963). This brisk, change-of-pace comedy role earned her a Golden Globe award and Emmy nomination, and lasted three seasons.Now officially a household name, Inger built up her momentum once again in films. A string of parts came her way within a three-year period including the sex comedy A Guide for the Married Man (1967) as roving eye husband Walter Matthau\'s unsuspecting wife; Clint Eastwood\'s first home-made American ""spaghetti western"", Hang \'Em High (1968); the crime drama, Madigan (1968) with Henry Fonda and Richard Widmark; the westerns Firecreek (1968) with Fonda again plus James Stewart, and 5 Card Stud (1968) opposite Dean Martin and Robert Mitchum; the political thriller House of Cards (1968) starring George Peppard and Orson Welles; and A Dream of Kings (1969) which reunited her with old flame Anthony Quinn. Although many of her co-starring roles seemed to be little more than love interest filler, Inger made a noticeable impression in the last movie mentioned, by far the most intense and complex of her film career. Adding to that mixture were a number of well-made TV mini-movies. On the minus side, she also resurrected the bad habit of pursuing affairs with her co-stars, which would include Dean Martin and, most notably, Burt Reynolds, her last.In April of 1970, Inger signed on as a series lead in a crime whodunit The Most Deadly Game (1970) to be telecast that September. It never came to be. Less than a week later, she was found unconscious on the floor of her kitchen by her housekeeper and died en route to the hospital of acute barbiturate intoxication -- a lethal combination of drugs and alcohol. Yvette Mimieux replaced her in the short-lived series that fall. For all intents and purposes, Ms. Stevens\' death was a suicide but Patterson\'s bio indicates other possibilities. Following her death, it came out in the tabloids that she had been secretly married to African-American Ike Jones since 1961. The couple was estranged at the time of her death.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net                    As a child she moved to Manhattan, Kansas, where she lived all the way through high school. When her father moved away, she moved in with a friend and stayed. She took dance classes at Kansas State University, then moved to Kansas City, where she taught dance and first got into modeling.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       rebecca_jenny7@hotmail.com          Spouse (2) Ike Jones (18 November\xa01961            - 30 April\xa01970)\xa0(her death)                         Anthony Soglio          (9 July\xa01955            - 18 August\xa01958)\xa0(divorced)          Trivia (13)      Following her suicide from acute barbiturate poisoning, it was revealed that Inger had been long married (from 1961) to African-American bit actor Ike Jones. The marriage, for obvious reasons, was kept under wraps to protect her career. They were estranged at the time she died.      She cheated death three times. In her first suicide attempt, she swallowed sleeping pills and ammonia which left her with blood clots in her lungs, legs swelled up to twice their size, and temporary blindness (she miraculously recovered within weeks); one time, she and Rod Steiger were nearly asphyxiated by carbon monoxide fumes while filming a scene from Cry Terror! (1958) in a tunnel (Steiger said years later she initially refused medical treatment at the scene, she said she wanted to die); and once she leaped from a crash-landing jet liner minutes before it exploded.      SPOILER: One of her best remembered TV roles was the episode The Twilight Zone: The Hitch-Hiker (1960), in which she played a frantic driver who kept passing the same hitchhiker on the road (""Going my way?""). The audience later finds out the phantom actually represented Death and that she had been killed in a car accident all along.      Was romantically involved with Bing Crosby during and after they appeared together in Man on Fire (1957). The relationship never led to marriage because Stevens refused to convert to Catholicism. When Crosby married Kathryn Grant, (who had converted) a year or two later, Stevens was devastated.      A month after her death, her widower, Ike Jones, asked to be named administrator of her estate. Her brother appeared in court to support him, and eventually was given half of the estate. He immediately gave all the money to children\'s charities and mental health organizations.      Replaced Barbara Bel Geddes on Broadway in ""Mary, Mary"" in 1962.      Was in the running but lost out on the role of Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany\'s (1961) to Audrey Hepburn.      First husband, Tony Soglio, was also her first agent. They married in 1955 but separated after only six months. Since there was no community property, he was given 5% of her earnings for the next seven years upon their 1958 divorce.      When she died in 1970, she left an estate estimated at $162,000.      A 1952 graduate of Manhattan (KS) High School, she is being inducted into the MHS Hall of Fame, along with classmate Del Close (January 2007).      Aunt to actress Athena Ashburn, who was married to actor/writer/director Gabriel Bologna, who is the son of the comedy acting/writing team of Joseph Bologna and Renée Taylor.      Niece of theatre and film actress Karin Stensland.      While studying at the famous Actors Studio, to earn money she became a dancer at New York\'s Latin Quarter nightclub.Personal Quotes (2)      A career, no matter how successful, can\'t put its arms around you. You end up being like Grand Central Station with people just coming and going. And there you are--left all alone.      Once I felt that I was one person at home and the minute I stepped out the door I had to be somebody else. I had a terrific insecurity and extreme shyness that I covered up with coldness.

He was enrolled in elocution courses at age five and by ten had appeared in his first film, Murder in the Family (1938), playing Peter Osborne, the younger brother of sisters played by Jessica Tandy and Glynis Johns. His mother brought Roddy and his sister to the US at the beginning of World War II, and he soon got the part of Huw, youngest child in a family of Welsh coal miners, in John Ford\'s How Green Was My Valley (1941), acting alongside Walter Pidgeon, Maureen O\'Hara and Donald Crisp in the film that won that year\'s best film Oscar. He went on to many other child roles, in films like My Friend Flicka (1943) and Lassie Come Home (1943) until, at age 18, he moved to New York, where he played a long series of successful stage roles, both on Broadway and in such venues as Connecticut\'s Stratford Festival, where he did Shakespeare. In addition to making many more movies (over 150), McDowall acted in television, developed an extensive collection of movies and Hollywood memorabilia, and published five acclaimed books of his own photography. He died at his Los Angeles home, aged 70, of cancer.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Ed Stephan <stephan@cc.wwu.edu>          Trade Mark (2)        Often made grand, eloquent speeches at the climax of the films he appeared in        Had the staggering ability to cry within seconds; all he needed to do to get the tears rolling, was to blink.Trivia (33)      In December 1998, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) honored him for his acting career and critically acclaimed photography by naming its photo archive after him. The collection, which includes several million negatives and stills, will be known as the Roddy McDowall Photograph Archive at the Margaret Herrick Library.      He was cremated after death and his ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean.      Had appeared on three different Batman series: he played the Bookworm in Batman (1966) and the Mad Hatter (Dr. Jervis Tetch) in Batman: The Animated Series (1992) and its spin-off The New Batman Adventures (1997).      In addition to appearing on both the original and animated Batman series (Batman (1966) and Batman: The Animated Series (1992)), he was also the reader for the book-on-tape version of the novelization of the first Batman (1989).      He was a rarity among movie stars in that he appears to have made no enemies at all during his lifetime. A man with numerous friends both in and out of show business, those who knew him continue to speak well of him to this day, and his funeral drew overflow crowds.      In 1943, 20th Century-Fox announced that McDowall would star in ""Oliver Twist"", but the film was not made.      Won Broadway\'s 1960 Tony Award as Best Supporting or Featured Actor (Dramatic) for ""The Fighting Cock"".      A clerical error on the part of 20th Century-Fox cost McDowall a likely Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor for his role as Caesar Augustus Octavian in Cleopatra (1963). The studio erroneously listed him as a leading player rather than a supporting one. When 20th Century-Fox asked the Academy to correct the error, it refused, saying the ballots already were at the printer. 20th Century-Fox then published an open letter in the trade papers, apologizing to McDowall: ""We feel that it is important that the industry realize that your electric performance as Octavian in Cleopatra, which was unanimously singled out by the critics as one of the best supporting performances by an actor this year, is not eligible for an Academy Award nomination in that category... due to a regrettable error on the part of 20th Century-Fox."".      In 1974, the FBI raided his home and seized his collection of films and television series during an investigation of copyright infringement and movie piracy. The collection consisted of 160 16mm prints and over 1,000 videocassettes. The value of the films was conservatively assessed at $5,005,426 by representatives of the movie industry. The actor was not charged and agreed to cooperate with the FBI. There was then no aftermarket for films, as the commercial video recorder had not been marketed, and studios routinely destroyed old negatives and prints of classic films they felt had no worth. Film buffs like McDowall had to purchase 16mm prints of films from the studios, or movie prints on the black market, or from other collectors. He claimed that he had once had as many as 337 movies in his collection, but at the time of the investigation he was not sure how many were still in his possession. He had bought Errol Flynn\'s movie collection, and had acquired other films through purchases or swaps. McDowall told the FBI that he had transferred many of his films to videotape in order to conserve space and because tape was longer-lasting than film, and subsequently had sold or traded the prints, plus other prints of movies he had lost interest in, to other collectors. He said that he collected the films due to his love of the cinema and to help protect the movies\' heritage. McDowall also said that being in possession of prints of his own films allowed him to study his acting and improve his craft. One of the films he had purchased, from American-International Pictures, was The Ballad of Tam Lin (1970), a movie he himself had directed. He explained that he believed that he was not in violation of copyright, as he was not showing the films for profit, nor trying to make a profit when selling his prints as he charged only what he remembered as the price he himself paid. He believed he had purchased some of the films outright from 20th Century-Fox, but learned subsequently from his lawyer that his agreement with 20th Century-Fox meant the studio retained ownership of the prints, and that he was forbidden to sell, trade or lend them out. McDowall was forthcoming about the individuals he dealt with on the black market, and also named Rock Hudson, Dick Martin and Mel Tormé as other celebrities with film collections.      Introduced Carol Lawrence to Robert Goulet. In fact, she jokingly said that McDowall was responsible for hers and Goulet\'s first child.      Biography in: ""American National Biography"". Supplement 1, pp. 396-398. New York: Oxford University Press, 2002.      Became close, lifelong friends with Peggy Ann Garner while filming The Pied Piper (1942) with her in 1941.      Final stage appearance was as Ebenezer Scrooge in the New York City production of ""A Christmas Carol"" in 1997. He alternated performances with Hal Linden.      On March 10, 1965, he attended the Los Angeles premiere of The Sound of Music (1965) as the date of the movie\'s star, Julie Andrews.      Lifelong friends with Elizabeth Taylor. Taylor has since referred to him as the one friend she had to whom she confided everything, and who was always understanding.      An accomplished ballroom dancer, he won both the Charleston and Cha-Cha contests on the The Arthur Murray Party (1950).      Explained in 1995 during an interview for American cable station USA Network the limitations of his make-up on Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973). Overwhelmed by frustration over the inability to eat, touch his face and the constant itch brought on by the chimpanzee prosthetics, he admitted to crying.      Along with Woodrow Parfrey, Norman Burton and Eldon Burke, he is one of only four actors to appear in both Planet of the Apes (1968) and Planet of the Apes (1974).      He was close friends with Maureen O\'Hara for 57 years, from the time that they made How Green Was My Valley (1941), their first and only film together, until his death in October 1998.      Both of the series in which he starred were short-lived science fiction series produced in the 1970s: Planet of the Apes (1974) and The Fantastic Journey (1977).      Has appeared in four of the five Planet of the Apes films. Having originally played the chimpanzee archaeologist Cornelius in Planet of the Apes (1968), he was unable to reprise his role in Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) as he was directing The Ballad of Tam Lin (1970) in Britain at the time. In that film, the role was played by David Watson. However, he later returned as Cornelius in Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971) and as his son Caesar in Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) and Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973).      Horse whisperer Monty Roberts was McDowall\'s stunt double for most of his childhood roles.      The day after his death, Angela Lansbury paid tribute to him on ""BBC Radio Five 5: Up all Night"". She described him as ""one of the most wonderful friends, anybody could possibly have . . . we\'ve lost a beloved friend"" and that he will be ""so missed"".      Parents are Thomas Andrew McDowall and Winifriede McDowall (Winifred Lucinda Corcoran; had an older sister: Virginia McDowall.      Had appeared on an episode of The Carol Burnett Show (1967) wearing his Planet of the Apes (1968) make-up. The look of fright on Carol Burnett\'s face was reputed to be genuine.      Had played the same character (The Mad Hatter) on three different series: Batman: The Animated Series (1992), Superman (1996) and The New Batman Adventures (1997).      Had played villains on both Batman (1966) and Batman: The Animated Series (1992), the only actor to do so.      Along with Adam West, Robert Hastings, Barry Dennen, Steve Franken, Michael Pataki and Judy Strangis, he is one of only seven actors to appear in both Batman (1966) and Batman: The Animated Series (1992).      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6632 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on February 8, 1960.      He cast his mother Winifriede McDowall as the innkeeper\'s wife in Kidnapped (1948). Although she dreamed of being an actress, it was her only on screen role.      He was born exactly one day after Batman (1966) actor Adam West. Both guest-starred on Batman: The Animated Series (1992) as well.      Was Jay Sandrich\'s first choice for the lead role of Arthur Carlson on WKRP in Cincinnati (1978), but was unavailable, hence, the role was given to Gordon Jump, who previously played the chief police officer on Soap (1977).      In Italy for the filming of Cleopatra (1963), became so frustrated with the numerous delays during its production, he begged Darryl F. Zanuck for a part in The Longest Day just so he could do some work and. ended up with a small role as an American soldier. Richard Burton, being in the same position followed suit and got a cameo role of an RAF pilot.Personal Quotes (10)      Intellectually, I\'d love to play Stanley Kowalski in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"". Can\'t you just imagine me down in the streets yelling, ""Stella! Stella!"". God, the critics would have a lot of fun with that one.      [on his more well-known roles as a child actor] I really liked Lassie, but that horse, Flicka, was a nasty animal with a terrible disposition. All the Flickas--all six of them--were awful.      My whole life I\'ve been trying to prove I\'m not just yesterday.      I enjoyed being in movies when I was a boy. As a child, you\'re not acting--you believe. Ah, if an adult could only act as a child does with that insane, playing-at-toy-soldiers concentration!      [in 1976, on his fellow former child stars] Compare us to your high school graduating class. You\'ll discover there is always a percentage of successes, and those who fall by the wayside to become alcoholics, dopers, or just plain losers. Sure there are the Bobby Driscolls, the tragedies, but don\'t forget the others: Elizabeth Taylor, Hayley Mills, Natalie Wood, Gene Reynolds--who\'s a successful producer--and so many others.      I absolutely adore movies. Even bad ones. I don\'t like pretentious ones, but a good bad movie, you must admit, is great.      All you can do is make a piece of product, sell it on its own terms, stand behind it and hope that people will go see it. If you try to be like something else or appeal to any given group, then you can very easily end up being gratuitous and imitative. There\'s not much to be gained by that and I think too much time is spent going around trying to be like someone else.      [on Mia Farrow] Trying to describe Mia is like trying to describe dust in a shaft of sunlight. There are all those particles. Her conversation is clotted.      [on the Elizabeth Taylor-Richard Burton romance] I knew back in Rome when we were making Cleopatra (1963) that it would never work. Elizabeth doesn\'t just love someone; she possesses them. And Richard isn\'t a man to be possessed. I\'m surprised it lasted as long as it did.      [in 1968, on his career] . . . totally isolated, really suffocating.

barrel, etc. Dean spends the rest of the movie trying to figure out
who's doing the killing.<br><br>While Dean is great, Roddy McDowall is fantastic as the sniveling
brother of Dean's girlfriend. He's a mean, cowardly, lying weasel, and
no one ever played a weasel better.<br><br>Yaphet Kotto is fine as the bartender, and Inger Stevens has a small,
shining role as the local purveyor of tonsorial delights (a barber).
Robert Mitchum comes into the film a little late; while he's straight
and true as the scripture-spouting preacher who sweeps out the long
abandoned church and begins hold services, you know he's hiding
something.<br><br>All in all a fine film. Maybe a little too long, though; the whole
movie doesn't amount to much more than enjoyable entertainment, but the
actors and the acting in it make this really worth watching.

The corrosion of any sort of quality in the screenwriting of recent decades
makes tight plotting a surprise wherever one finds it.  Here it is.  The
ongoing verbal duel between Martin and Mitchum is Shakespeare compared to
the posturing of recent tough-guy flicks.  Also see Martin's acting in ""Rio
Bravo"" to find significant talent in an often-overlooked comic
actor.

5 Card Stud is a re-make of Dark City which was released in 1950 and
was Charlton Heston's feature film debut. Dean Martin is now playing
the Heston part and in many ways he's reprising the role he did in Some
Came Running. The role of gambler comes natural to him, it was one of
many professions Dino tried in his youth before discovering show
business. <br><br>In the original the part Robert Mitchum plays originated with Mike
Mazurki. Mazurki had a limited role in Dark City so Mitchum's part has
been built up considerably. As always Robert Mitchum is interesting.<br><br>The original Dark City involved a high stakes poker game in which Don
DeFore got trimmed of the rent money and just about everything else.
Rather than go home, he kills himself. Soon afterward his psychotic
brother goes on a rampage against everyone in that game.<br><br>It's no suicide here, but a lynching as the victim is caught cheating.
If you've seen Dark City than you already know who the murderer is and
it's not too hard to figure it out here. <br><br>In the supporting cast, standing out are Roddy McDowell as the spoiled
son of a local rancher who leads the lynch party and Yaphett Kotto who
is the bartender in the saloon where the fatal poker game took place.<br><br>Martin and Mitchum work well together, this is good entertainment.

It's a film noir/Western/suspense of bizarre beauty and extraordinary
performances ; being based on a novel by Ray Gaulden and interesting
screenplay by Marguerite Roberts . A card shark is caught cheating, he
is taken out and lynched , later on , this engenders several murders .
The players in an ongoing poker game are being mysteriously killed off,
one by one . A professional gambler (Dean Martin) who attempted to
prevent the lynching tries to ensnare the assassin with the aid of a
preacher (Robert Mitchum) with a weapon .<br><br>Suspenseful film dealing with a card player who is lynched by the
drunkards he was playing against. Tension from the opening game going
on until ending and never lets up , being for Agata Christie
aficionados . This is a tremendously exciting story of an obstinate
card player and a strange preacher with a gun . It begins as a
slow-moving Western but follows to surprise us with dark characters ,
strong supporting work , solid plot and in whodunit style . The tale is
almost grim , a priest comes to a town just in time to make sure its
citizenry but later the events get worse . Main cast is frankly
magnificent . Sympathetic Dean Martin as as a reluctant card gambler
and nice Robert Mitchum as a gun-toting preacher . First-rate Robert
Mitchum in similar role and performance to ¨Night of the hunter¨ that
was the acting of his life . In addition , Roddy McDowall steals the
show as the cynic Nick . Supporting cast is extremely good such as
Inger Stevens as Lily Langford , Katherine Justice as Nora Evers , John
Anderson as Marshal Dana , Yaphet Kotto as Little George , Denver Pyle
as Sig and Whit Bissell as Dr. Cooper , among others . Good Technicolor
cinematography by Daniel F. Fapp . Enjoyable musical score ties up a
top-notch Western package ; it is composed by the maestro Maurice Jarre
. Furthermore , agreeable song by Dean Martin , including lyrics by Ned
Washington . Watchable results for this offbeat Western .<br><br>This well-paced in cracking style flick is compellingly directed by
Henry Hathaway and usually works very well , taking a firm grip on the
action and suspense . Here he directs efficiently Dean Martin and with
strong screen presence by Robert Mitchum , both of whom collaborated in
some Western . Hathaway himself was only even nominated for an Oscar ,
but his movies themselves are testimony to his skills to heighten
narrative tension and shoot action so exhilarating it made adrenalin
run . He does the human touch and full of insight that accompanied him
during most of his films and the story develops pleasantly in a large
frame with an interesting plot and fully adjusted to the requirements
of the action . Henry was a craftsman who had a long career from the
30s with successful films , and especially Westerns , as ¨Brigham
Young¨ and ¨Raw Hide¨ . In his 60s Hathaway still got the vigour to
make some fiery movies as ¨From Hell to Texas¨, ¨How the West was won¨,
¨Nevada Smith¨, and ¨Shoot out¨ . He was an expert on Western genre as
he proved in ¨True grit¨ , ¨Five card stud¨ , ¨Nevada Smith¨ ,¨How the
West was won¨ , ¨Rawhide¨ , ¨Brigham Young¨ , ¨Buffalo Stampede¨,
¨Garden of evil¨ and ¨The sons of Katie Elder¨. Rating : nice Western
that will appeal to Robert Mitchum and Dean Martin fans .

There can't be more whodunit westerns out there, which makes 5 card
stud unique. The plot is a watered-down westernised version of Agatha
Christie's 'Ten Little....whatever', or 'And Then There Were None' to
give it it's American title.<br><br>After a fellow poker player is exposed as a cheat, Van Morgan, (Dean
Martin), tries to stop a lynching and only succeeds in getting
blindsided by a gun butt for his trouble. The culprit and leader of the
lynch mob is Nick Evers, (played by a slightly miscast Roddy McDowall).<br><br>Unable to go to the town Marshall he opts to leave town instead. It is
only when he hears about the killing of two members of the lynching
party he becomes suspicious that one of the other poker players are
trying to cover their tracks by bumping off the others. Not happy about
being a potential target, he returns to town to find the killer, before
more deaths occur.<br><br>Robert Mitchum is the town's new arrival as Reverand Johnathan Rudd.
Rudd's a Reverand with a difference, he's just as quick with a gun as
he is to pull a quote from the good book. Van immediately takes a
liking to this 'Pastor with a Pistol', and to all around he seems a
pleasant amiable fellow if not a bit of a religious nut case.<br><br>With each death, Van knows that his odds of survival are shortening and
uncovers the identity of both the killer and the guy who's been tipping
him off just in time.<br><br>Even though Roddy McDowall had been in America for nearly 30 years at
this point, he is still just too English to have been cast in a
western. This was also not Robert Mitchum's first time playing the mad
pastor. He'd done it before in 1955 in the gripping The Night Of The
Hunter though his portrayal of Harry Powell in that movie had a more
psychotic edge than Rev. Rudd's friendly persona.<br><br>Dean Martin happily sleeps his way through his role with relative ease,
as only he could, and does it with style. However, we're given a love
triangle sub-plot with Katherine Justice and Inger Stevens, which isn't
really needed and thankfully doesn't detract from the main plot.<br><br>Another thing worthy of note is the Maurice Jarre penned theme tune
sung brilliantly by Dean Martin, in my opinion the best singer of 'em
all. However, the closing credit informing the audience that it was
Martin singing seemed a little redundant as he had one of the most
unmistakable voices in show business.<br><br>Great Western though a little outdated for the time given that Hang 'em
High. The Wild Bunch and Butch &amp; Sundance were it's contemporaries.<br><br>Enjoy.

Probably wouldn't have stuck with this one if I didn't know Robert
Mitchum was showing up eventually but it ended up getting a lot better
as it went on. The plot was interesting and I liked the way they didn't
reveal the killer in a sensational twist seeing as most people would
have worked it out by then. A good example of suspense being better
than surprise.<br><br>That being said the structure of the film was a bit loose, It spent a
lot of time on things that didn't really have any importance to the
story when I thought it could have spent more time establishing certain
characters motivations and relationships and I thought sometimes the
snappy style dialog was a bit stilted. Some of the acting was also a
bit awkward. It was only about a third to about a half way through the
movie that I decided I liked it but in the end it was quite enjoyable
and once again Mitchum was awesome

""Garden of Evil"" director Henry Hathaway's western whodunit ""5-Card
Stud"" pits 'hellfire gambler' Dean Martin against 'gunfire preacher'
Robert Mitchum in a frontier tale about lynching, murder, and revenge.
Mind you, deducing the whodunit will pose only a minor challenge for
astute audiences. You will spot the actor committing the crimes long
before the film identifies him in its second-to-last scene. If you
study the stable strangling scene, the killer's headgear reveals his
identity. The characters in ""True Grit"" scenarist Marquerite Roberts'
screenplay, based on Ray Gaulden's novel, are flat since they change
neither their mentality nor their morality. Nevertheless, Roberts boots
around a provocative question about ""who people were before they became
who they are"" which segues with the mystery. Otherwise, this Hathaway
horse opera is sturdy enough, contains a believable cast and knows how
to blend comedy with drama nimbly enough so it rarely becomes either
heavy-handed or repetitious. <br><br>Compared with Hathaway's other oaters, ""5-Card Stud"" doesn't top ""True
Grit,"" ""The Sons of Katie Elder,"" ""Garden of Evil,"" ""From Hell to
Texas,"" or ""Rawhide."" ""5-Card Stud,"" however, does surpass ""Shoot Out""
and ""Nevada Smith."" Although some critics didn't cotton to Maurice
Jarre's orchestral score and even denigrated it as ""Dr. Zhivago"" on the
range,' I contend it is superb music and differs from anything that
Jerry Goldsmith, Elmer Bernstein, or Ennio Morricone would have
provided. Jarre's score enlivens the action and enhances the
atmosphere. The Dean Martin ""5-Card Stud"" title song marks this
sagebrusher as a traditional western. As far back as the 1950s, most
major sagebrushers contained a ballad about the story or the hero with
lyrics like "". . . play your poke and he'd leave you broke."" The song
here paints a portrait of the protagonist and his poker playing skill.<br><br>Interestingly, ""5-Card Stud"" makes some racial references that chipped
away at the usual barriers. In one scene, Mitchum's gunslinging
preacher doesn't think it inappropriate that a black man be buried
among whites, something that marked this western as a departure from
Jim Crow mentality. John Sturges' ""The Magnificent Seven"" had broken
ground earlier with a gunfight so an Indian could be buried in a white
graveyard.<br><br>Professional gambler Van Morgan (Dean Martin of ""Sons of Katie Elder"")
takes a break from a Saturday night poker game while Sig Ever's son
Nick (Roddy McDowell of ""Planet of the Apes""), stableman Joe Hurley
(Bill Fletcher of ""Hour of the Gun""), Mace Jones (Roy Jenson of ""Big
Jake""), storekeeper Fred Carson (Boyd 'Red' Morgan of ""Violent
Saturday""),and Ever's ranch hand Stoney Burough (George Robotham of
""The Split"") continue to gamble with newcomer Frankie Rudd (Jerry
Gatlin of ""The Train Robbers"") until Nick catches Rudd cheating
'red-handed' and assembles a lynch party. They haul Rudd against his
will out to a stream and string him up from the bridge. Barkeeper
George (Yaphet Koto of ""Live and Let Die"") warns Morgan, and Morgan
lights out after Nick and company to thwart the necktie party. ""You
don't hang a cheat,"" Morgan growls, ""you kick him out of town."" When
Morgan arrives, Frankie is swinging with a noose around his neck, and
Nick buffalos Morgan on the back of the head with his six-gun.<br><br>Mama Malone (Ruth Springford of ""Vengeance Is Mine"") discovers Morgan
strewn on the boardwalk the following morning and summons George to
help the battered gambler to his room. Morgan decides to pull out of
Rincon and try his luck in Denver. Before he leaves, he rides out to
Sig Ever's spread to bid goodbye to Sig's comely daughter Nora
(Katherine Justice of ""The Way West"") and deck Nick as repayment for
clobbering him at the hanging. <br><br>Naturally, the town marshal (John Anderson of ""Young Billy Young"") can
neither identify the lynch mob nor can he identify the hanged man.
Later, participants in the card game begin to die. One is wrapped up in
barbed wire. Another is hanged in the church. Still another is
suffocated in a barrel of flour. Indeed, Hathaway and Roberts make each
death look different. Eventually, George visits Morgan in Denver and
Morgan decides to return to Rincon. Two things have changed since
Morgan rode out. First, the town has acquired a gun-toting pastor who
renovates the church and holds services. Second, Lilly Langford (Inger
Stephens of ""Hang'em High"") has opened a barbershop that features a $20
item that intrigues Morgan when he visits her establishment. Lilly and
Nora contend for Morgan, while our hero closes in on the new preacher
Jonathan Rudd. <br><br>""5-Card Stud"" boasts several good scenes. Hathaway does a good job of
staging a shoot-out in the streets of Rincon when paranoid miners go
berserk because they fear they may be the next victims of the local
serial killer. If you slow down your DVD or VHS copy, Dean Martin loses
his Stetson when he seizes an axle to let a wagon haul him out of
harm's way. You can see his headgear fall off completely. In the next
scene, Martin's hat is back on his head. Nevertheless, it is still a
neat gunfight with Morgan and Rudd standing back to back against the
opposition. <br><br>The scene at a windmill where Rudd hits each of the windmill blades
because he was aiming at the spaces between the blades is fun, too.
George plays a role in the story and provides his buddy Morgan with a
clue to the killer's identity. The animosity between Nick Evers and Van
Morgan is feisty throughout the action with Nora trying to do her best
to dampen it. Van Morgan and Lilly have some amusing banter. The
expository scenes about Nick's childhood almost make his character
marginally sympathetic.<br><br>Indeed, ""5-Card Stud"" is no classic, but it is good enough for a rainy
day.

Not a bad movie. Robert Mitchum and Dean Martin pull this one off
pretty good. There are a few flaws in the plot but it all works out in
the end. It's a good popcorn movie to watch when you have nothing to
do. Besides the mild violence, I think your kids could watch this one
with you as a family movie.<br><br>Roddy McDowall plays the whinny little weasel perfect. You hate him
from the start to the ending, and can't wait for him to get his. And
this is what a great actor can make you feel. And Inger Stevens plays
the temptress so well. How could anyone not fall for a beautiful woman
like her? She could make a good man go bad, and a bad man blush.<br><br>So break out the popcorn, sit backs and don't expect too much, and you
might have a smile on your face after the movie.

story when I thought it could have spent more time establishing certain
characters motivations and relationships and I thought sometimes the
snappy style dialog was a bit stilted. Some of the acting was also a
bit awkward. It was only about a third to about a half way through the
movie that I decided I liked it but in the end it was quite enjoyable
and once again Mitchum was awesome

""Garden of Evil"" director Henry Hathaway's western whodunit ""5-Card
Stud"" pits 'hellfire gambler' Dean Martin against 'gunfire preacher'
Robert Mitchum in a frontier tale about lynching, murder, and revenge.
Mind you, deducing the whodunit will pose only a minor challenge for
astute audiences. You will spot the actor committing the crimes long
before the film identifies him in its second-to-last scene. If you
study the stable strangling scene, the killer's headgear reveals his
identity. The characters in ""True Grit"" scenarist Marquerite Roberts'
screenplay, based on Ray Gaulden's novel, are flat since they change
neither their mentality nor their morality. Nevertheless, Roberts boots
around a provocative question about ""who people were before they became
who they are"" which segues with the mystery. Otherwise, this Hathaway
horse opera is sturdy enough, contains a believable cast and knows how
to blend comedy with drama nimbly enough so it rarely becomes either
heavy-handed or repetitious. <br><br>Compared with Hathaway's other oaters, ""5-Card Stud"" doesn't top ""True
Grit,"" ""The Sons of Katie Elder,"" ""Garden of Evil,"" ""From Hell to
Texas,"" or ""Rawhide."" ""5-Card Stud,"" however, does surpass ""Shoot Out""
and ""Nevada Smith."" Although some critics didn't cotton to Maurice
Jarre's orchestral score and even denigrated it as ""Dr. Zhivago"" on the
range,' I contend it is superb music and differs from anything that
Jerry Goldsmith, Elmer Bernstein, or Ennio Morricone would have
provided. Jarre's score enlivens the action and enhances the
atmosphere. The Dean Martin ""5-Card Stud"" title song marks this
sagebrusher as a traditional western. As far back as the 1950s, most
major sagebrushers contained a ballad about the story or the hero with
lyrics like "". . . play your poke and he'd leave you broke."" The song
here paints a portrait of the protagonist and his poker playing skill.<br><br>Interestingly, ""5-Card Stud"" makes some racial references that chipped
away at the usual barriers. In one scene, Mitchum's gunslinging
preacher doesn't think it inappropriate that a black man be buried
among whites, something that marked this western as a departure from
Jim Crow mentality. John Sturges' ""The Magnificent Seven"" had broken
ground earlier with a gunfight so an Indian could be buried in a white
graveyard.<br><br>Professional gambler Van Morgan (Dean Martin of ""Sons of Katie Elder"")
takes a break from a Saturday night poker game while Sig Ever's son
Nick (Roddy McDowell of ""Planet of the Apes""), stableman Joe Hurley
(Bill Fletcher of ""Hour of the Gun""), Mace Jones (Roy Jenson of ""Big
Jake""), storekeeper Fred Carson (Boyd 'Red' Morgan of ""Violent
Saturday""),and Ever's ranch hand Stoney Burough (George Robotham of
""The Split"") continue to gamble with newcomer Frankie Rudd (Jerry
Gatlin of ""The Train Robbers"") until Nick catches Rudd cheating
'red-handed' and assembles a lynch party. They haul Rudd against his
will out to a stream and string him up from the bridge. Barkeeper
George (Yaphet Koto of ""Live and Let Die"") warns Morgan, and Morgan
lights out after Nick and company to thwart the necktie party. ""You
don't hang a cheat,"" Morgan growls, ""you kick him out of town."" When
Morgan arrives, Frankie is swinging with a noose around his neck, and
Nick buffalos Morgan on the back of the head with his six-gun.<br><br>Mama Malone (Ruth Springford of ""Vengeance Is Mine"") discovers Morgan
strewn on the boardwalk the following morning and summons George to
help the battered gambler to his room. Morgan decides to pull out of
Rincon and try his luck in Denver. Before he leaves, he rides out to
Sig Ever's spread to bid goodbye to Sig's comely daughter Nora
(Katherine Justice of ""The Way West"") and deck Nick as repayment for
clobbering him at the hanging. <br><br>Naturally, the town marshal (John Anderson of ""Young Billy Young"") can
neither identify the lynch mob nor can he identify the hanged man.
Later, participants in the card game begin to die. One is wrapped up in
barbed wire. Another is hanged in the church. Still another is
suffocated in a barrel of flour. Indeed, Hathaway and Roberts make each
death look different. Eventually, George visits Morgan in Denver and
Morgan decides to return to Rincon. Two things have changed since
Morgan rode out. First, the town has acquired a gun-toting pastor who
renovates the church and holds services. Second, Lilly Langford (Inger
Stephens of ""Hang'em High"") has opened a barbershop that features a $20
item that intrigues Morgan when he visits her establishment. Lilly and
Nora contend for Morgan, while our hero closes in on the new preacher
Jonathan Rudd. <br><br>""5-Card Stud"" boasts several good scenes. Hathaway does a good job of
staging a shoot-out in the streets of Rincon when paranoid miners go
berserk because they fear they may be the next victims of the local
serial killer. If you slow down your DVD or VHS copy, Dean Martin loses
his Stetson when he seizes an axle to let a wagon haul him out of
harm's way. You can see his headgear fall off completely. In the next
scene, Martin's hat is back on his head. Nevertheless, it is still a
neat gunfight with Morgan and Rudd standing back to back against the
opposition. <br><br>The scene at a windmill where Rudd hits each of the windmill blades
because he was aiming at the spaces between the blades is fun, too.
George plays a role in the story and provides his buddy Morgan with a
clue to the killer's identity. The animosity between Nick Evers and Van
Morgan is feisty throughout the action with Nora trying to do her best
to dampen it. Van Morgan and Lilly have some amusing banter. The
expository scenes about Nick's childhood almost make his character
marginally sympathetic.<br><br>Indeed, ""5-Card Stud"" is no classic, but it is good enough for a rainy
day.

Not a bad movie. Robert Mitchum and Dean Martin pull this one off
pretty good. There are a few flaws in the plot but it all works out in
the end. It's a good popcorn movie to watch when you have nothing to
do. Besides the mild violence, I think your kids could watch this one
with you as a family movie.<br><br>Roddy McDowall plays the whinny little weasel perfect. You hate him
from the start to the ending, and can't wait for him to get his. And
this is what a great actor can make you feel. And Inger Stevens plays
the temptress so well. How could anyone not fall for a beautiful woman
like her? She could make a good man go bad, and a bad man blush.<br><br>So break out the popcorn, sit backs and don't expect too much, and you
might have a smile on your face after the movie.

Loosely based on the autobiography of Rudi van Danzi, FOR A LOST
SOLIDER tells the story of a Dutch boy's emotional and sexual
relationship with a young adult American solider during World War II.
The film presents the relationship as a loving and often magical
one--and asks the viewer to consider if such relationships are
intrinsically abusive or if they might, in extraordinary instances,
have validity and even integrity.<br><br>It should be very obvious that the subject and issues raised are likely
to provoke a knee-jerk reaction in most people--but even so, FOR A LOST
SOLDIER has remarkable delicacy. The film is not explotational in any
way, it is beautifully acted and filmed, and the difficult material is
handled by the director, writer, and cinematographer with considerable
grace.<br><br>All of this said, however, the film is so careful to avoid the obvious
pitfalls that in some respects it fails to make any significant
statement. What ultimately emerges is a memory--the film is presented
as an extended flashback--but exactly how that memory reverberates in
present time is vaguely expressed at best. And while the film does not
consider this particular relationship to be deliberately abusive, it
begs but never answers the question of intrinsic abusive, leaving the
viewer to do battle with that knotty issue entirely on their own.<br><br>Those who watch FOR A LOST SOLIDER thoughtfully and with an open mind
will find it forces them to define their own ideas about what is and is
not abusive. This may actually be point of the film, to motivate an
examination of personal values--but if so it is a point made by a very,
at times almost impossibly indirect implication. Recommended for
sophisticated viewers, but even they are more likely to find it more
problematic than substantial.<br><br>Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer

I will be the first to admit that the subject matter is a bit risqué
for the typical American movie goer. However, keep in mind that this is
told exclusively from the viewpoint of the child. It is also done in a
realistic and yet romantic way. The child is obviously longing for
comfort and security, having been removed from the security of his
family during WWII. In addition to being placed into a foster home, a
pubescent Jeroen finds himself realizing his budding sexuality is that
of one who is attracted to the same sex, which also adds to the
feelings of loneliness and isolation. This film deals with a difficult
topic, but does it in a way that simply tells a story with enormous
feeling and sophistication.<br><br>It reminds me of being a young man and wondering what it would be like
to feel safe and comforted in the arms of someone older with whom I had
complete trust and with whom I was enamored.<br><br>Not everyone will see it this way - only the pure of heart.

I was happy that I was able to see this movie. I was very moved by it,
by the truth of the way the relationship between the boy and the man
was shown. I was also happy to see it on the IMDb, and know that
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, etc., had not been able to get all the
tapes burned.<br><br>The wonderful thing about the movie is that it avoids judgment--
negative or positive--about the relationship. The relationship
happened. The people involved were not bad. And yet, the fact that the
boy never got over the love of that man suggests the inherent inbalance
in that type of relationship. Do you think the soldier went through the
rest of his life trying to find the boy?<br><br>At any rate, these are just my questions. The movie is innocent, and
does not make judgments, ask questions, or give answers, as befits a
beautiful work of art. This movie needed to be made.

With all the furor over ""Lolita,"" one might think a film such as ""For a
Lost
Soldier,"" the story of a barely pubescent Dutch boy who has a sexual
affair
with a Canadian soldier in the closing days of WWII, would raise a few
eyebrows as well.  Perhaps there is a different standard for the
relationship between an ""older"" man (albeit, in this case, an older man
barely out of his teens) and a child.  But, for those inclined to explore
this issue on film, ""For a Lost Soldier"" does an admirable job of making
such a relationship seem acceptable, and perhaps even inevitable, in view
of
the hysteria that accompanied the Liberation of Europe by the Allied
troops.
The relationship between Walt and Jaroen seems particularly idyllic when
contrasted with those of Walt's comrades-in-arms with the village girls,
who
graduate almost overnight from schoolgirls to strumpets.  If a book
version
exists, I look forward to reading it.

The many favorable reviews hailing this film as a cinematic delight are
well taken. The delicate subject matter of a brief romantic
relationship between an allied WWII soldier and a young boy in the
occupied Nehterlands received a beautiful treatment. Without becoming
lurid or vulgar, it is implied that the innocent ""child"" and the young
soldier engaged in a sex act.<br><br>Many layers of sub-plots surround the story. The people in the village
setting appear deeply religious, constantly learning how to be proper
followers of Scriptural guidance. Sermons given to the locals, amidst
the visiting soldiers are both thankful for the liberators' arrival,
yet warning the ""young women"" not to be tempting these men to be lead
astray. It was a subtle switch from preaching in Englsih, to the native
Dutch that showed who the audience for that particular part of the
sermon was.<br><br>There are many references to sexual tensions. The teenage boys suddenly
notice the physical beauty in teenage girls. Without doubt, there was
plenty of ""fraternizing"" between soldiers and local women. The scene
where the young main character is out ""exploring"" with a slightly older
boy is charged with sexual innuendo. The boy's ""step father"" is quite
observant about the ""goings on"", yet offers no direct objections, only
indirect and vague advice.<br><br>The question of whether a mere child can give consent to sexual
activity with an adult remains. The picture of the soldiers who came to
liberate the town is one of men who felt entitlement. They felt they
had every right to ""have fun"" after saving the people from their evil
oppressors. Although the young girls, and even our 12 year old main
character, were willing participants in any ""affairs"", the sense that
the soldiers felt entitled to receive whatever they desired in exchange
for their desperately needed Military help, and the many hand-outs of
Life-Savers, Gum, Cigarettes etc. changes nothing about their feeling
of power over the situation.<br><br>For a grown man, a love affair of a few days can hardly be considered
""love"", but for a child whose innocence is forever lost, this is an
affair they will never forget. Love is something not to be trifled
with. A child's innocence should be regarded with no less respect.
Whatever the ""feelings"" of the heart may have been, a 12 year old does
well to give it a bit more time before seeking that first love.

I have watched this film many times and I recently viewed it again.  The
only really interesting part of the movie is the relationship between the
young boy and the soldier.  Everything else that happens in the film is
really just to establish why this young man would be drawn to someone kind
and caring.  What I wish would have been delved into more was how the
soldier came to feel the way he does about the kid.  He talks a little
about
his past with his father and mother but never really  explains himself
personally.  He does not look like he would have ever had a problem getting
a girl, so his ""prediliction"" becomes even more a mystery.<br><br>I really applaud the fact that the film maker was able to tell this story
so
sensitively without it being lurid.  It is a shame I think that a film like
this could never have been made in America, ""the land of the free"".

I don't know if a boy of 12 can be attracted sexually to an adult male
as was depicted in this movie. For me it raises the question of at what
age does a person who is going to grow up gay become interested in
someone of the same sex. It is obvious that the young soldier takes
advantage of the innocence of a youngster although it is suggested too
that the feelings of the soldier are more than merely sexual. The dance
scene implies that there was love. The end of the movie and the title
implies that the boy remembers the soldier in later years and as a
mature adult with affection and perhaps longing so one is tempted to
conclude that relationship with the young soldier though brief was
meaningful. I was reminded of the relationship of the boy and the old
man in Cinema Paradiso which although certainly not of a sexual nature
was also very important to both the boy and the man. For a Lost Soldier
gave me much to think about and is likely to provoke much thought in
the intelligent viewer.

A haunting film, sympathetically tackled from the child's perspective.
It seems that there are large (and probably important) sections of the
book which are not covered in the film. It is difficult, therefore, to
completely understand Jeroen's feelings for his 'buddy'.<br><br>Whilst the boy's distance from his parents (mother only?) as an evacuee
is clear early on there would appear to be a loneliness which is not
truly explored. Jeroen gains some attachment to the (father) man of the
house whilst appearing alienated from the children (especially the son)
and the youngsters evacuated with him.<br><br>One is left with the impression that this is a genuine love and true
friendship (which both protagonists need - they are both a distance
from their families after all) between a boy and a young man and there
is no sense of the 'darker side' of how that relationship was initiated
by the older of the two - albeit the one muted sex scene would not have
been shown in a UK-made film I am sure.<br><br>The man does not handle his departure well. If he truly cared for the
boy then he certainly did not prepare him for the loss which impacted
the rest of Jeroen's life.<br><br>I would like to read the book - but there appear to be only two in the
world for sale at extortionate prices. This film needs a sympathetic
viewing from those whose own lives may mirror some of the events in
some way.

begs but never answers the question of intrinsic abusive, leaving the
viewer to do battle with that knotty issue entirely on their own.<br><br>Those who watch FOR A LOST SOLIDER thoughtfully and with an open mind
will find it forces them to define their own ideas about what is and is
not abusive. This may actually be point of the film, to motivate an
examination of personal values--but if so it is a point made by a very,
at times almost impossibly indirect implication. Recommended for
sophisticated viewers, but even they are more likely to find it more
problematic than substantial.<br><br>Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer

I will be the first to admit that the subject matter is a bit risqué
for the typical American movie goer. However, keep in mind that this is
told exclusively from the viewpoint of the child. It is also done in a
realistic and yet romantic way. The child is obviously longing for
comfort and security, having been removed from the security of his
family during WWII. In addition to being placed into a foster home, a
pubescent Jeroen finds himself realizing his budding sexuality is that
of one who is attracted to the same sex, which also adds to the
feelings of loneliness and isolation. This film deals with a difficult
topic, but does it in a way that simply tells a story with enormous
feeling and sophistication.<br><br>It reminds me of being a young man and wondering what it would be like
to feel safe and comforted in the arms of someone older with whom I had
complete trust and with whom I was enamored.<br><br>Not everyone will see it this way - only the pure of heart.

I was happy that I was able to see this movie. I was very moved by it,
by the truth of the way the relationship between the boy and the man
was shown. I was also happy to see it on the IMDb, and know that
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, etc., had not been able to get all the
tapes burned.<br><br>The wonderful thing about the movie is that it avoids judgment--
negative or positive--about the relationship. The relationship
happened. The people involved were not bad. And yet, the fact that the
boy never got over the love of that man suggests the inherent inbalance
in that type of relationship. Do you think the soldier went through the
rest of his life trying to find the boy?<br><br>At any rate, these are just my questions. The movie is innocent, and
does not make judgments, ask questions, or give answers, as befits a
beautiful work of art. This movie needed to be made.

With all the furor over ""Lolita,"" one might think a film such as ""For a
Lost
Soldier,"" the story of a barely pubescent Dutch boy who has a sexual
affair
with a Canadian soldier in the closing days of WWII, would raise a few
eyebrows as well.  Perhaps there is a different standard for the
relationship between an ""older"" man (albeit, in this case, an older man
barely out of his teens) and a child.  But, for those inclined to explore
this issue on film, ""For a Lost Soldier"" does an admirable job of making
such a relationship seem acceptable, and perhaps even inevitable, in view
of
the hysteria that accompanied the Liberation of Europe by the Allied
troops.
The relationship between Walt and Jaroen seems particularly idyllic when
contrasted with those of Walt's comrades-in-arms with the village girls,
who
graduate almost overnight from schoolgirls to strumpets.  If a book
version
exists, I look forward to reading it.

The many favorable reviews hailing this film as a cinematic delight are
well taken. The delicate subject matter of a brief romantic
relationship between an allied WWII soldier and a young boy in the
occupied Nehterlands received a beautiful treatment. Without becoming
lurid or vulgar, it is implied that the innocent ""child"" and the young
soldier engaged in a sex act.<br><br>Many layers of sub-plots surround the story. The people in the village
setting appear deeply religious, constantly learning how to be proper
followers of Scriptural guidance. Sermons given to the locals, amidst
the visiting soldiers are both thankful for the liberators' arrival,
yet warning the ""young women"" not to be tempting these men to be lead
astray. It was a subtle switch from preaching in Englsih, to the native
Dutch that showed who the audience for that particular part of the
sermon was.<br><br>There are many references to sexual tensions. The teenage boys suddenly
notice the physical beauty in teenage girls. Without doubt, there was
plenty of ""fraternizing"" between soldiers and local women. The scene
where the young main character is out ""exploring"" with a slightly older
boy is charged with sexual innuendo. The boy's ""step father"" is quite
observant about the ""goings on"", yet offers no direct objections, only
indirect and vague advice.<br><br>The question of whether a mere child can give consent to sexual
activity with an adult remains. The picture of the soldiers who came to
liberate the town is one of men who felt entitlement. They felt they
had every right to ""have fun"" after saving the people from their evil
oppressors. Although the young girls, and even our 12 year old main
character, were willing participants in any ""affairs"", the sense that
the soldiers felt entitled to receive whatever they desired in exchange
for their desperately needed Military help, and the many hand-outs of
Life-Savers, Gum, Cigarettes etc. changes nothing about their feeling
of power over the situation.<br><br>For a grown man, a love affair of a few days can hardly be considered
""love"", but for a child whose innocence is forever lost, this is an
affair they will never forget. Love is something not to be trifled
with. A child's innocence should be regarded with no less respect.
Whatever the ""feelings"" of the heart may have been, a 12 year old does
well to give it a bit more time before seeking that first love.

I have watched this film many times and I recently viewed it again.  The
only really interesting part of the movie is the relationship between the
young boy and the soldier.  Everything else that happens in the film is
really just to establish why this young man would be drawn to someone kind
and caring.  What I wish would have been delved into more was how the
soldier came to feel the way he does about the kid.  He talks a little
about
his past with his father and mother but never really  explains himself
personally.  He does not look like he would have ever had a problem getting
a girl, so his ""prediliction"" becomes even more a mystery.<br><br>I really applaud the fact that the film maker was able to tell this story
so
sensitively without it being lurid.  It is a shame I think that a film like
this could never have been made in America, ""the land of the free"".

I don't know if a boy of 12 can be attracted sexually to an adult male
as was depicted in this movie. For me it raises the question of at what
age does a person who is going to grow up gay become interested in
someone of the same sex. It is obvious that the young soldier takes
advantage of the innocence of a youngster although it is suggested too
that the feelings of the soldier are more than merely sexual. The dance
scene implies that there was love. The end of the movie and the title
implies that the boy remembers the soldier in later years and as a
mature adult with affection and perhaps longing so one is tempted to
conclude that relationship with the young soldier though brief was
meaningful. I was reminded of the relationship of the boy and the old
man in Cinema Paradiso which although certainly not of a sexual nature
was also very important to both the boy and the man. For a Lost Soldier
gave me much to think about and is likely to provoke much thought in
the intelligent viewer.

A haunting film, sympathetically tackled from the child's perspective.
It seems that there are large (and probably important) sections of the
book which are not covered in the film. It is difficult, therefore, to
completely understand Jeroen's feelings for his 'buddy'.<br><br>Whilst the boy's distance from his parents (mother only?) as an evacuee
is clear early on there would appear to be a loneliness which is not
truly explored. Jeroen gains some attachment to the (father) man of the
house whilst appearing alienated from the children (especially the son)
and the youngsters evacuated with him.<br><br>One is left with the impression that this is a genuine love and true
friendship (which both protagonists need - they are both a distance
from their families after all) between a boy and a young man and there
is no sense of the 'darker side' of how that relationship was initiated
by the older of the two - albeit the one muted sex scene would not have
been shown in a UK-made film I am sure.<br><br>The man does not handle his departure well. If he truly cared for the
boy then he certainly did not prepare him for the loss which impacted
the rest of Jeroen's life.<br><br>I would like to read the book - but there appear to be only two in the
world for sale at extortionate prices. This film needs a sympathetic
viewing from those whose own lives may mirror some of the events in
some way.

Nicholson is also notable for being one of two actors - the other being Michael Caine - who have received Oscar nomination in every decade from the 1960s through the early 2000s.Nicholson was born on April 22, 1937 in Neptune, New Jersey. He was raised believing that his grandmother was his mother, and that his mother, June Frances Nicholson, a showgirl, was his older sister. He discovered the truth in 1975 from a Time magazine journalist who was researching a profile on him. His real father is believed to have been either Donald Furcillo, an Italian-American showman, or Eddie King (Edgar Kirschfeld), born in Latvia and also in show-business. Jack\'s mother\'s ancestry was Irish, English, as well as German, Scottish and Welsh.Nicholson made his film debut in a B-movie titled The Cry Baby Killer (1958). His rise in Hollywood was far from meteoric, and for years, he sustained his career with guest spots in television series and a number of Roger Corman films, including The Little Shop of Horrors (1960).Nicholson\'s first turn in the director\'s chair was for Drive, He Said (1971). Before that, he wrote the screenplay for The Trip (1967), and co-wrote Head (1968), a vehicle for The Monkees. His big break came with Easy Rider (1969) and his portrayal of liquor-soaked attorney George Hanson, which earned Nicholson his first Oscar nomination. Nicholson\'s film career took off in the 1970s with a definitive performance in Five Easy Pieces (1970). Nicholson\'s other notable work during this period includes leading roles in Roman Polanski\'s noir masterpiece Chinatown (1974) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest (1975), for which he won his first Best Actor Oscar.The 1980s kicked off with another career-defining role for Nicholson as Jack Torrance in Stanley Kubrick\'s adaptation of Stephen King\'s novel The Shining (1980). A string of well-received films followed, including Terms of Endearment (1983) which earned Nicholson his second Oscar; Prizzi\'s Honor (1985) and The Witches of Eastwick (1987). He portrayed another renowned villain, The Joker, in Tim Burton\'s Batman (1989). In the 1990s, he starred in such varied films as A Few Good Men (1992), for which he received another Oscar nomination, and a dual role in Mars Attacks! (1996).Although a glimpse at the darker side of Nicholson\'s acting range reappeared in The Departed (2006), the actor\'s most recent roles highlight the physical and emotional complications one faces late in life. The most notable of these is the unapologetically misanthropic Melvin Udall in As Good as It Gets (1997), for which he won his third Oscar. Shades of this persona are apparent in About Schmidt (2002), Something\'s Gotta Give (2003) and The Bucket List (2007). In addition to his Academy Awards and Oscar nominations, Nicholson has seven Golden Globe Awards, and received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2001. He also became one of the youngest actors to receive the American Film Institute\'s Life Achievement award in 1994.Nicholson has five children: Eldest daughter Jennifer Nicholson (b. 1963), from his marriage to Sandra Knight which ended in 1968; Caleb James Goddard (b. 1970) with Susan Anspach; Honey Hollman (b. 1981) with Danish supermodel, Winnie Hollman; and Lorraine Nicholson (b. 1990) and Ray Nicholson (b. 1992) with Rebecca Broussard. Nicholson\'s longest relationship was the seventeen years he spent with actress Anjelica Huston; this ended when Broussard become pregnant with his child.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Pedro Borges          Spouse (1) Sandra Knight (17 June\xa01962            - 8 August\xa01968)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)          Trade Mark (8)        Dark sunglasses        Slow drawl and shark\'s grin        Often plays charming, anti-authoritarian characters        Frequently works with Danny DeVito        Frequently works as a character with mental instability        His somewhat maniacal laugh        Method acting.

[October 1997]      Recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute. [1994]      Used to be a messenger boy for MGM\'s cartoon department.      He was the 2001 John F. Kennedy Center Honors recipient.      Dedicated his Oscar for As Good as It Gets (1997) to J.T. Walsh, his co-star in A Few Good Men (1992) who had died shortly before the Academy Awards in 1998.      In 1994, in an apparent bout of rage, he smashed a man\'s car window in with a golf club. He expressed remorse for the incident in an interview with US magazine.      Loves jokes at his expense so much that he showed up at every Academy Awards hosted by Billy Crystal, who in turn would incorporate Nicholson somehow in the telecast.      Lives on famed ""Bad Boy Drive"" a.k.a. Mulholland Drive in Beverly Hills, California. It\'s nicknamed so because its residents have included former Hollywood bad boys Warren Beatty, and the late Marlon Brando.      Is an avid fan of the Los Angeles Lakers and is often seated next to his good friend Lou Adler. He rarely misses a Lakers home game. Contrary to popular belief, Nicholson never had production companies schedule the filming of a movie he was in to accommodate his attendance at sporting events. Nicholson is also a life-long fan of the New York Yankees.      Along with Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty, he was asked to play the role of Michael Corleone in The Godfather (1972).      The Best Lady at his wedding to Sandra Knight was Millie Perkins. The Best Man was Harry Dean Stanton. After their divorce, Nicholson lived, for a time, at Harry Dean Stanton\'s place.      Long refused to do any televised interviews except for press conferences. But in recent years, he has occasionally agreed to speak briefly when approached by reporters. He has not appeared on a talk show since 1971.      Flew to Cuba and met with Fidel Castro in June 1998. While there, he also met with leaders of the Cuban film industry, enjoyed local restaurants, jazz clubs and visited a famous cigar factory. He left greatly impressed with the country and its Communist dictator, who he described as ""a genius"", though the luxuries he was treated to on the island are off-limits to most Cuban citizens.      Each one of the films for which he has won an Oscar has also won Best Actress in a Leading Role (Louise Fletcher, One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest (1975); Shirley MacLaine, Terms of Endearment (1983); Helen Hunt, As Good as It Gets (1997)).      Has a second home in Aspen, Colorado.      Graduated from Manasquan High School in Manasquan, New Jersey, where he was voted ""Class Clown"" by the Class of 1954.      Boyhood friends with Danny DeVito. Nicholson\'s relatives and DeVito\'s relatives managed a hair salon together.      Presented the Best Picture Oscar eight times (1972, 1977, 1978, 1990, 1993, 2006, 2007 and 2013), more than any other actor or actress. Though he was a relative newcomer and lacked the status typically associated with Best Picture presenters, the then-two-time nominee took on the assignment in 1972 when many better-known celebrities balked at the job, worried that they would be tainted if Stanley Kubrick\'s A Clockwork Orange (1971) won the top gong and they were seen by the public as linked to the controversial picture. Nicholson, who early on declared publicly that he loved the Oscar (when the sentiment was not chic), happily obliged. In addition to presenting the Best Actress trophy in 1999, he also presented the Thalberg Award to Warren Beatty in 2000 and an honorary award to Michelangelo Antonioni in 1995.      Batman creator Bob Kane personally recommended him for the role of the Joker in Batman (1989).      His mother, June Frances (Nicholson), had English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, and Pennsylvania Dutch (German) ancestry. Jack never knew his biological father, and was raised by his maternal grandparents. He was led to believe that June was his older sister and his grandparents were his parents. It was not until 1974, when a Time magazine reporter researched his life, that he learned the truth. An Italian immigrant named Donald Furcillo, who was married briefly to June, may have been Jack\'s biological father. It is also possible that Jack\'s biological father was Edgar A. Kirschfeld, a Latvian-born entertainer (known as ""Eddie King""). Nicholson has chosen not to investigate further.      Turned down the role of Johnny Hooker in The Sting (1973) to play Billy ""Bad Ass"" Buddusky in The Last Detail (1973), which was written by his close friend Robert Towne, as he did not want to appear in a purely commercial picture just then. Robert Redford eventually played the role. Both Nicholson and Redford were nominated for Best Actor of 1973 at the Academy Awards, losing to Jack Lemmon for Save the Tiger (1973).      Turned down the lead role of Roy Neary in Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), even though he knew the movie would be a success as he felt that the special effects would overwhelm any actor in the movie.      Has appeared in One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest (1975) and Tommy (1975). Both of those films were nominated for Best Actress Oscars. ""Cuckoo"" star Louise Fletcher won.      Has been nominated for an acting Oscar in five different decades (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s).      Attended his 50th high school reunion at Manasquan High School in Manasquan, New Jersey. Needless to say, his classmates were surprised and delighted that he attended. [2004]      Is one of only two actors to receive a Best Supporting Actor Oscar after winning a Best Actor Oscar. (The other is Gene Hackman.).      The character Shipwreck from the animated G.I. Joe series of the 1980s was partly based on him (and partly based on Popeye the Sailor Man).      Claims his personal favorite performances are his works in One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest (1975), Batman (1989), Hoffa (1992) and As Good as It Gets (1997).      With his seventh Best Actor nomination for As Good as It Gets (1997) , he surpassed Laurence Olivier as the most nominated actor ever with 11 total nominations (Nicholson had four Best Supporting Actor nominations in 1970, 1982, 1984 and 1991; Olivier had nine Best Actor (tied for the most in that category with Spencer Tracy) and one Best Supporting Actor nominations. Nicholson extended the lead with his eight Best Actor nod for About Schmidt (2002), which tied him with Paul Newman for second place in Best Actor nominations. (Newman also has one Supporting Actor nomination).      A 12 time acting nominee (eight times as Best Actor, four times as Best Supporting Actor), he ties Katharine Hepburn\'s 12 nominations (all in the Best Actress category) and only Meryl Streep with 14 (10 in the Best Actress category) has more acting nominations. (Bette Davis was nominated 10 times for an Academy Award, all of them Best Actress nods.).      After presenting the Best Picture Oscar at The 78th Annual Academy Awards (2006) to Crash (2004), he told the press he was surprised as he thought Brokeback Mountain (2005) would win. Nicholson then told the press that he himself had voted for Brokeback Mountain (2005).

With the release of Suicide Squad (2016), Nicholson and Jared Leto will be the only two actors still living to have played ""The Joker"" in a (non fan-made) live action Batman production (Cesar Romero died in 1994; Heath Ledger died in 2008).      He was nominated for the 2008 New Jersey Hall of Fame for his services to Arts and Entertainment.      While accepting the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 1999 Golden Globes, he noted that his first day of work as a film actor was May 5, 1955, which he took as a good omen as ""5"" was the jersey number of his boyhood idol, Joe DiMaggio. He attended DiMaggio\'s memorial service four months later.      Actor with the most awards from the New York Film Critics: Easy Rider (1969), Chinatown (1974) and The Last Detail (1973), One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest (1975), Terms of Endearment (1983), Prizzi\'s Honor (1985) and The Witches of Eastwick (1987)/Ironweed (1987)/Broadcast News (1987).      At about 5\' 9"", he is the shortest actor to have played the Joker in a (non fan-made) live-action Batman production. Cesar Romero stood 6\' 3"" and the most recent ""Joker"", Heath Ledger, was 6\' 1"".      As of 2009, he has an estimated fortune of nearly $240 million.      (August 29, 2009) Attended the Catholic funeral mass of Senator Ted Kennedy at the Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica in Boston.      Is the only actor to receive two Best Lead Actor Oscars for films that also won Best Lead Actress: One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest (1975) with Louise Fletcher and As Good as It Gets (1997) with Helen Hunt.      He was inducted into the 2010 New Jersey Hall of Fame for his services and contributions to Arts and Entetainment.      Does not have a cellphone.      Lives in Beverly Hills, Malibu, Los Angeles, California, Aspen, Colorado and Kailua, Hawaii.      (May 30, 2010) Waved the green flag that officially started the Indianapolis 500 automobile race.      Has appeared on the cover of GQ magazine three times: March 1981, January 1990 and January 1996.      His art collection includes Matisse, Warhol, Tamara de Lempicka and Picasso; the collection is estimated to be worth over $100 million. [2011]      Is one of only four actors to receive two Oscars for films that also won Best Picture (the others are Marlon Brando, Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman).      As of 2013, he\'s one of the six actors to receive three acting Oscars, the others being: Walter Brennan, Ingrid Bergman, Katharine Hepburn (who has four), Meryl Streep and Daniel Day-Lewis.      After his first screen test, Louis B. Mayer said to him: ""I don\'t know what we can use you for but if we ever do need you, we\'ll need you real bad."".      Became a father for the first time at age 26 when his [now ex] wife Sandra Knight gave birth to their daughter Jennifer Nicholson on September 13, 1963.      Became a father for the second time at age 33 when his [now ex] girlfriend Susan Anspach gave birth to their son Caleb James Goddard in 1970. Nicholson has never had contact with Goddard.      Became a father for the third time at age 44 when his [now ex] lover Winnie Hollman gave birth to their daughter Honey Hollman in 1981. Nicholson was in a relationship with Anjelica Huston when he conceived Hollman.      Became a father for the fourth time at 52 when his [now ex] girlfriend Rebecca Broussard gave birth to their daughter Lorraine Nicholson on April 16, 1990. Nicholson was in a relationship with Anjelica Huston when Lorraine was conceived.      Became a father for the fifth time at age 54 when his [now ex] girlfriend Rebecca Broussard gave birth to their son Ray Nicholson on February 20, 1992.      Has two grandsons; Sean (born 1996) and Duke Norfleet (born 1999), via daughter Jennifer Nicholson.      Is the only actor to ever play the Devil, the Joker, and a werewolf.      As of 2014, has appeared in ten films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: Five Easy Pieces (1970), Chinatown (1974), One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest (1975), Reds (1981), Terms of Endearment (1983), Prizzi\'s Honor (1985), Broadcast News (1987), A Few Good Men (1992), As Good as It Gets (1997) and The Departed (2006). Of those, One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest (1975), Terms of Endearment (1983) and The Departed (2006) are winners in the category.      In the movie The Last Detail (1973), Nicholson\'s character says ""Marines are really assholes, you know that? It takes a certain kind of a sadistic temperament to be a Marine."" Later in his career in the movie A Few Good Men (1992), he played Marine Colonel Nathan Jessup.      Two of his three Oscar-winning performances were directed by James L. Brooks. This makes him one of four actors to win two Oscars under the same person\'s direction. The other three are: Walter Brennan for Come and Get It (1936) and The Westerner (1940) (both directed by William Wyler), Dianne Wiest for Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) and Bullets Over Broadway (1994) (both directed by Woody Allen) and Christoph Waltz for Inglourious Basterds (2009) and Django Unchained (2012) (both directed by Quentin Tarantino).      Was interested in playing The Father in A Christmas Story (1983) but the budget could not meet his high salary demands.      Had a meeting with Disney about voicing Hades in Hercules (1997). He turned them down due to the offer of salary they were offering him.      Prior to playing The Joker, he was considered for Lex Luthor in Superman (1978). That role ultimately went to Gene Hackman.      In 1977, he attended the murder trial of Claudine Longet in Aspen, Colorado. The courthouse he sat in (the Pitkin County Courthouse) is the very same courtroom where infamous serial killer Ted Bundy was brought into to stand trial for murder several months later.      Has twice been interviewed in Playboy magazine. His second interview is printed in the 50th anniversary issue.      Is a Democrat.      He was considered for the role of Thomas Hagen in The Godfather (1972) before Robert Duvall was cast.      He was considered for the role of Eddie Valiant in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), which went to Bob Hoskins.      He was offered the role of Gunnery Sgt. Emil Foley in An Officer and a Gentleman (1982), which he turned down. The role was instead given to Louis Gossett Jr. who went on to receive an Oscar for his performance.      He was considered for the role of villain Howard Payne in Speed (1994), which went to his good friend Dennis Hopper instead.      Is an accomplished and well payed ""ghost writer"" for the movie industry.      Has worked with 10 directors who have won a Best Director Oscar: Vincente Minnelli, Mike Nichols, Roman Polanski, Milos Forman, Elia Kazan, Warren Beatty, Tony Richardson, James L. Brooks, John Huston and Martin Scorsese.      Biographer Patrick McGilligan stated in his book ""Jack\'s Life"" that Latvian-born Eddie King (originally Edgar A. Kirschfeld), may have been Nicholson\'s biological father.Personal Quotes (67)      The average celebrity meets, in one year, ten times the amount of people that the average person meets in his entire life.      [on the $5 million he earned for A Few Good Men (1992)] It was one of the few times when it was money well spent.      [regarding Terms of Endearment (1983)] When I read the part, I knew I\'d win the Oscar for it.      You only lie to two people in your life: your girlfriend and the police.      If you get an impulse in a scene, no matter how wrong it seems, follow the impulse. It might be something and if it ain\'t - take two!      A star on a movie set is like a time bomb. That bomb has got to be defused so people can approach it without fear.      [on the birth of his son after having had two daughters] I finally got it right.      When I come up against a director who has a concept that I don\'t agree with, or maybe I just haven\'t thought of it or whatever, I\'d be more prone to go with them than my own because I want to be out of control as an actor, I want them to have the control, otherwise it\'s going to become predictably my work, and that\'s not fun.      I only take viagra when I am with more than one woman.      I\'m not a raver anymore, all good things must come to an end.      I was particularly proud of my performance as the Joker. I considered it a piece of pop art.      My motto is: more good times.      A question you always ask in acting is, Where were you going if this scene didn\'t interrupt the movements of the character?      ""You\'re new here, aren\'t you?"" Nicholson, who rarely is seen in public without his sunglasses, replied when asked by a photographer to take off his glasses for a photo.      There\'s a period just before you start a movie when you start thinking, I don\'t know what in the world I\'m going to do. It\'s free-floating anxiety. In my case, though, this is over by lunch the first day of shooting.      Every director implored me, ""Jack, can\'t you talk a little bit faster?"" It was like a hot button for me and I would become hateful. So when Roman started to say it, I began and he said, ""Jack, this movie is 100-and-something pages long. To have a movie that is screen able, you\'ll have to talk a little faster"". [Roman Polanski directed him in Chinatown (1974)].      [on turning down the role played by Robert Redford in The Sting (1973)] I liked the period, the whole project and I knew it would be commercial. But at the time, I needed to put my energies into a movie that really needed them. I needed to take a risk.      [on being nominated for an Oscar for the third time for The Last Detail (1973)] The first time I was up for an Oscar, I thought I would win it. But I didn\'t have as sharp a view as I do now. The second time... I expected to lose, and deservedly lose, to George C. Scott. But even getting a nomination blows my mind. I\'d love to win but now that I\'ve had several good performances that people at large have liked, it becomes harder to excite them. And familiarity breeds contempt.      So I mean it when I say that if you can\'t appreciate Brando, I wouldn\'t know how to talk to you. If there\'s anything obvious in life, this is it. Other actors don\'t go around discussing who is the best actor in the world, because it\'s obvious - Marlon Brando is.      I don\'t want people to know what I\'m actually like. It\'s not good for an actor.      I\'m very contra my constituency in terms of abortion because I\'m positively against it. I don\'t have the right to any other view. My only emotion is gratitude, literally, for my life.      [on Stanley Kubrick] Just because you\'re a perfectionist doesn\'t mean you\'re perfect.      Beer, it\'s the best damn drink in the world.      (1992) I don\'t believe in God now. I can still work up an envy for someone who has a faith. I can see how that could be a deeply soothing experience.      As an actor, I have no desire for anybody to understand my past work. Period.      (1996) I just wish every film I liked wasn\'t either foreign or made in America but with such terrible difficulty. This is the worst period ever for trying to do interesting work.      With my sunglasses on, I\'m Jack Nicholson. Without them, I\'m fat and seventy.      I would be so happy if I didn\'t smoke, for a lot of reasons. I can\'t believe that I can\'t break the habit. I don\'t want to be lying around, dying in Cedar\'s Sinai Hospital and thinking that I was as stupid enough, a man who is as petrified of dying as I am, to have done it to myself. I\'m a real fraidy-cat about mortality.      The thing I like about The Joker is that his sense of humor is completely tasteless.      We were moving to a freer society before AIDS. Most people who investigated this knew that if you were not shooting up or getting f***ed in the heinie, you were as likely to get AIDS as you were to have a safe fall on your head while walking down Wilshire Boulevard. But you could not proselytize this view. The facts were almost useless. You couldn\'t give a woman the facts and have her respond, \'Oh, all right.\'      I think it is very unattractive for me to be seen fawning over little, tiny girls. I didn\'t feel that for a long time but now I do. If I could slip them out the back entrance wrapped in a blanket, that\'s a different story. (February 2004)      [on Jessica Lange] She is like a delicate fawn, but crossed with a Buick.      I\'ve grown out of talking like I know something when I don\'t.      Explaining his controversial remarks on the death of Heath Ledger: What I actually said was, \'I warned them.\' I had a bad experience with those sleeping pills that Ledger apparently took. I took one of these pills and had just gone to sleep when I had a phone call to go to an emergency at a friend\'s house. I jumped up, went outside and some time later woke up on the driveway. It sounds amusing but I live in the mountains and it could\'ve been worse. I didn\'t know Heath Ledger, but I know those pills.      Star quality is if you\'re on stage and a cat walks on and they still watch you.      It\'s not so nice when you are 71 and looking for some action. I feel uncomfortable doing it in the limelight - so from now on I\'ll do it when it\'s right. Happily, when it comes to girls hitting on me, I\'m not undernourished.      [When asked would he see The Dark Knight (2008)] I\'m not inclined to watch it because of what I said. But if it\'s a good movie, I\'ll catch up with it somewhere. I don\'t think they ever really captured Tim Burton\'s spirit [since he stopped being involved]. They kind of drove the franchise into the ground. Tim Burton\'s a genius. He had the right take on it. That\'s why I did the movie. I did the movie based on a single conversation with him. We both come from the cartoon world originally. We had similar ideas. Tim said the Joker should have a humorous dark side to him. Burton is one of the great movie makers. I think the world of him. He\'s the most unassuming man. And he doesn\'t feel pressure. That\'s what I love about him. Once he\'s in there, he\'s smiling making the movie. That\'s it!      I come from the Lynchs of Sligo (Ireland). You know, I went there, but I looked in the phone book and there are nine million Lynchs in Sligo.      There\'s no one before or since like Marlon Brando. The gift was enormous and flawless, like [Pablo Picasso]. Brando was a genius who was the beginning and end of his own revolution. You didn\'t rush him. He had a tremendous gift just in his stillness. I was in high school when I saw The Wild One (1953). He changed my life forever... a monumental artist. There was no way to follow in his footsteps. He was just too large and just too far out of sight. He truly shook the world, and his influence will be there long into the future.      [on Stanley Kubrick] Everyone pretty much acknowledges him as The Man, and I still think that underrates him.      I was talking to Sean Penn on the phone today. I told him it was interesting that they managed to leave me off this long list of Method actors they\'d published in some article. I told him, ""I\'m still fooling them!"" I consider it an accomplishment. Because there\'s probably no one who understands Method acting better academically than I do, or actually uses it more in his work. But it\'s funny -- nobody really sees that. It\'s perception versus reality, I suppose.      For a long time, I was afraid to be alone. I had to learn how to be alone. And there are still times when I think, Uh-oh! I gotta talk to somebody here or I\'m gonna go crazy! But I like to be alone. Now I do. I really do. There\'s a big luxury in solitude.      After September 11, I held my tongue. All of the public positions had been taken -- for, against, good, evil. I had nothing more to add. So I thought, Bring in the clowns, you know what I mean? That\'s why I\'ve done a coupla years\' worth of comedies.      [on On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (1970)] All I am in the movie is bad.      [on Professione: reporter (1975)] Antonioni says he just tries to make something beautiful because truth is beautiful and beauty is truth. That\'s what I\'m really into. I like making beautiful things. Maybe that sounds ridiculous but when I choose a film to do, it\'s because it interests me in that way rather than any other. I look at every character I play on the screen as being completely separate. You can say most of them are outsiders, but it\'s hard today to think of any character in a film who isn\'t an outsider. All I ask is that they relate to the truth in some way.      I hate giving advice, because people won\'t take it.      [on his signature glasses] They\'re prescription. That\'s why I wear them. A long time ago, the Middle American in me may have thought it was a bit affected maybe. But the light is very strong in southern California. And once you\'ve experienced negative territory in public life, you begin to accept the notion of shields. I am a person who is trained to look other people in the eye. But I can\'t look into the eyes of everyone who wants to look into mine; I can\'t emotionally cope with that kind of volume. Sunglasses are part of my armor.      I love discourse. I\'m dying to have my mind changed. I\'m probably the only liberal who read Treason, by Ann Coulter. I want to know, you understand? I like listening to everybody. This to me is the elixir of life.      I\'m the age where we didn\'t have television as kids. So when I saw my nieces and nephews watching Howdy Doody (1954), Kukla, Fran and Ollie (1969), and so forth, I thought the world had gone mad.      I always hesitate to say things like this in interviews because they tend to come back to haunt you, but if I were an Arab-American, I would insist on being profiled. This is not the time for civil rights. There are larger issues for Americans.      I\'d prefer if people had no impressions of me. As a kid, I had to tell my own family, ""Please, just don\'t talk about me!"" Because they always got it wrong. Always. I just didn\'t want them to tell anyone anything about me. God knew, they had a great opinion and they loved me and meant well, but it was like, Please, you don\'t have this right. You know what I mean?      I don\'t know if this is a true statistic, but I heard somewhere that there are three times as many single women over forty as single men. That\'s what we got from the women\'s movement. The chickens have come home to roost.      The less people know about me, the easier my job is.      [on Debra Winger] She\'s real smart, very dedicated, extremely resourceful about her work. You put up with her contentiousness because there is always something at the bottom. You get something you wouldn\'t get unless you took the trip with her. The girl\'s got boom.      (2011, on his own own mortality) One of the toughest parts of aging is losing your friends. At first it starts quietly, then pretty soon it\'s every month, and you can\'t help but think, ""When is that bell going to go off for me?"" And on top of that you feel this constant loss. At this time of life, you feel just a sword\'s point from death. It\'s frightening - who wants to face God and the clear white light? I know I definitely don\'t. Yet.      (2011) I am from a different era of movie acting. My career doesn\'t depend on explosions and pyrotechnics.      (2011) On set I\'m an actor like every other actor. Most times, for every part I play, I can think of other actors who would be better. I worry from the moment I take a job.      (2011) I\'ve had everything a man could ask for, but I don\'t know if anyone could say I\'m successful with affairs of the heart. I don\'t know why. I would love that one last real romance. But I\'m not very realistic about it happening. What I can\'t deny is my yearning. I\'ve been in love in my life, but it always starts with obsession that lasts exactly 18 months and then it changes. If I\'d known and been prepared for that, I may have been able to orchestrate the whole relationship thing better...But when I\'m with someone I\'ve often defied every one of my conventions. I\'ve been so struck I\'ve said, ""Come on, let\'s go, let\'s get married."" But no woman has ever recognized what I say as being legitimate. They think of my reputation, Jack the Jumper. I\'m damned by what people think. Now I think I have a gap I won\'t ever cross.      (2011) I would never complain about my life, even though I really would like to have a mate. It\'s not like I\'m starved for company - I have a few very good lady friends - but there\'s only a certain amount of times a woman wants to see you and never go out for dinner. I got tired of arguing with women about going to have dinners, so I hired somebody to cook. The food is better at my house.      I\'m not worried about wrinkles, in myself or in women. I find them interesting. I can\'t see so well, so sometimes I look in the mirror and I see how I was as a young man.      I\'m so rich that I\'m going to sell myself like an ordinary person. I\'m not into money at all.      [advice to Harry Dean Stanton on screen-acting] Just let the wardrobe be the character. You play yourself. That\'s the way you approach it.      [on working with Michelangelo Antonioni on Professione: reporter (1975)] Antonioni was like a father figure to me. I worked with him because I wanted to be a film director and I thought I could learn from a master. He\'s one of the few people I know that I ever really listened to.      [on Michelle Pfeiffer] She\'s a good egg, I\'m crazy about her... You couldn\'t really say Michelle is glacial, but there\'s obviously something oscillating beneath the surface there. Her first look at people is ""Yeah, well, what do you want?"" It\'s a form of protection because she\'s very sensitive. You never could steamroll Michelle. She\'s always very tough in that sense.      [on Heath Ledger\'s death] I warned him of the stress, the pressure, and the expectations that comes with that Joker character.      [on working with Martin Scorsese in The Departed (2006)] We wanted to create a really bad man, basically a villain who was pretty flamboyant and somebody who you wanted them to get pretty bad. I thought it would bring out the best in Marty.      In my whole career there was only one time when a director said to me, ""OK, come right down the pike and just look beautiful, Jack"". That was Ken Russell on Tommy (1975).Salary (19)On a Clear Day You Can See Forever\xa0(1970)      $12,500       Chinatown\xa0(1974)      $500,000       Tommy\xa0(1975)      $75,000       One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest\xa0(1975)      $1,000,000 + 15% gross      The Missouri Breaks\xa0(1976)      $1,250,000 + 10% of all gross receipts above $12.5m      The Shining\xa0(1980)      $1,250,000       Terms of Endearment\xa0(1983)      $1,000,000 + profit percentage (totalling $9,000,000)      Heartburn\xa0(1986)      $4,000,000       The Witches of Eastwick\xa0(1987)      $6,000,000       Ironweed\xa0(1987)      $5,000,000       Batman\xa0(1989)      $6,000,000       The Two Jakes\xa0(1990)      $5,000,000       A Few Good Men\xa0(1992)      $5,000,000       Hoffa\xa0(1992)      $10,000,000       Wolf\xa0(1994)      $13,000,000       As Good as It Gets\xa0(1997)      $15,000,000       The Pledge\xa0(2001)      $10,000,000       About Schmidt\xa0(2002)      $10,000,000       Anger Management\xa0(2003)      $20,000,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nMary Steenburgen ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 41 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(2)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(22)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(12)  Overview (3)Date of Birth8\xa0February1953,\xa0Newport, Arkansas, USA Birth NameMary Nell SteenburgenHeight5\'\xa08""\xa0(1.73\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Mary Steenburgen is an Academy Award-winning American actress.She was born February 8, 1953, in Newport, Arkansas, USA. Her mother, Nellie May (Wall) Steenburgen, was a school-board secretary, and her father, Maurice H. Steenburgen, was a freight-train conductor. Her surname comes from distant Dutch ancestry, and her roots also include English, Scottish, and Welsh.Young Steenburgen was fond of arts and literature. Mary grew up tap-dancing her way through talent shows and school functions. She was active in her school drama class. After appearing in a number of high school plays, she enrolled at Hendrix College, a highly progressive Southern School located in Conway, Arkansas. Upon the recommendation of her drama professor, she left college in 1972 and moved to New York to study acting professionally. In the past several years, Mary Steenburgen has emerged as one of the most accomplished and sought-after screen actresses. Ever since Jack Nicholson \'discovered\' her and cast her as a sassy adventuress in his rollicking western, Goin\' South (1978), her career has skyrocketed and she has won acclaim for exceptional performances in each of her diverse film roles. In Nicholas Meyer\'s Time After Time (1979), Steenburgen was afforded critical praise for her portrayal of a somewhat dippy but liberated young bank clerk in San Francisco who crosses paths, via time machine, with English author H.G. Wells (played by Malcolm McDowell, who later became her husband. In 1980 she shot to fame with her role as Lynda Dummar in Melvin and Howard (1980) for which she won Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. More recently, Steenburgen again impressed audiences and critics alike with her stunning performance as the strong-willed turn-of-the-century Mother in Ragtime (1981).Steenburgen is a notable patron of arts. She is also an active supporter of humanitarian causes. She has two children from her previous marriage to actor Malcolm McDowell.

Who wouldn\'t love kissing Johnny Depp all day?      I know this is kind of corny, but we thought about renewing our vows again because I think my mom would really love it if we did that in Arkansas, where I came from.      It\'s usually, my people speak to your people and then they speak around each other and trade calls for weeks.      I think that we need to look hard at our beliefs and be responsible about how we speak out.      I helped found Artists for New South Africa, but it used to be called Artists for Free South Africa. Alfre Woodard and a bunch of us started this.      Anything to do with the South resonates with me, because I\'m Southern.      There\'s a certain arrogance to an actor who will look at a script and feel like, because the words are simple, maybe they can paraphrase it and make it better.      It was a few days later I came out to Hollywood for a screen test, and so did a lot of other people. So I really didn\'t think I would get it. I was definitely the one that was least likely to get it, because everyone else was an already established star.      I\'d already made the decision before I\'d even read it-just because it was John Sayles. Then when I read it, the themes were actually themes that have been a big part of my life.      I was this person with this weird last name from New York that no one had ever heard of. But my screen test I guess, according to him, was the best. So I got the part, which was incredible.      I take the fact that films cost a lot of money very seriously, but once in a while to have somebody say, This is a big scene, take your time with it, is important. That\'s John Sayles.      There\'s just such a premium on hurrying, and the camera is the be all and end all, and the actors had better hurry up and get it right and get it done.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nChristopher Lloyd ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 43 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(4)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(3)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(26)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(5)  Overview (4)Date of Birth22\xa0October1938,\xa0Stamford, Connecticut, USA Birth NameChristopher Allen LloydNicknameChris    Height6\'\xa01""\xa0(1.85\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Christopher Lloyd was born on October 22, 1938 in Stamford, Connecticut, USA as Christopher Allen Lloyd.

Younger brother of Sam Lloyd Sr..      Attended and graduated from Staples High School in Westport, Connecticut (1958).      As a young actor, he performed at the Yale Repertory Theater with Meryl Streep.      Has appeared in over two hundred plays, including many on Broadway, regional and summer stock productions.      For his brief 1985 scenes in Back to the Future (1985), he wore prosthetic make-up to appear 30 years older than in his 1955 scenes, which dominate the film. In the sequels, the 1985 Doc Brown has more scenes. To avoid having to put him through extensive make-up every morning, writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale came up with the idea of Doc Brown visiting a rejuvenation clinic in the future, which results in his face looking much younger.      Attended the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City.      Attended the prestigious Fessenden School in West Newton, Massachusetts.      In a scene in Back to the Future (1985), his character Dr. Emmett L. ""Doc"" Brown, hangs on the arm of a large clock. This mimics a stunt done by Harold Lloyd (no relation) in the movie Safety Last! (1923).      To prepare for the role of Taber in One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest (1975), he lived in a mental institution for several weeks and studied the patients. He modeled his character after one of the patients and stayed in character through all filming even when not on screen.      Has appeared with Anjelica Huston in five films: One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest (1975), The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981), The Cowboy and the Ballerina (1984), The Addams Family (1991) and Addams Family Values (1993).      Has worked with Frank Welker in five films: Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984), Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp (1990), The Pagemaster (1994) and In Search of Dr. Seuss (1994).      His Taxi (1978) character, Reverend Jim Ignatowski, was a huge fan of the original Star Trek (1966) series. Lloyd went on to play the Klingon commander Kruge in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984).      In Man on the Moon (1999), he appears as himself reprising his old role of Reverend Jim Ignatowski in scenes from Taxi (1978), 20 years after the sitcom had aired.      A devoted bicyclist, he once rode through Italy, pedaling from Milan to Venice, over the Dolomites, along the Amalfi coast and to Naples.      At age 19, he moved to Manhattan and began studying with the acting teacher Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse.      Attended and graduated from the Darrow School, whose alumni include Chris \'Mad Dog\' Russo, Gregory Hughes and photographer Jane Feldman.      In a June 2009 interview, Lloyd said that the role of Klingon commander Kruge in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984) was among one of his favorite roles he ever portrayed in his acting career.      Won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor in Twenty Bucks (1993).      He was considered for the role of Jack Torrance in Stanley Kubrick\'s The Shining (1980), which went to Jack Nicholson.      He was considered for the role of Stanley Spadowski in \'Weird Al\' Yankovic\'s UHF (1989), which went to Michael Richards.      Owns a home in Montana; his home in Montecito, California was destroyed by the Tea Fire of November 2008.      His maternal grandfather, Lewis Henry Lapham (1858-1934), was one of the founders of the Texaco Oil Company.      His maternal uncle, Roger Lapham (1883-1966), was the Mayor of San Francisco from 1944 through 1948.      Is the youngest of seven children of Samuel R. Lloyd and Ruth Lapham.      Grew up in Fairfield County\'s New Canaan, Connecticut.Personal Quotes (5)      [2012, on Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)] Here was another guy who, okay, he was a toon, but he was also just so evil. So evil. I mean, dipping the little shoes and other little toons into the dip? He was just nasty. And, of course, I loved the makeup. That outfit I wore, the glasses, the whole look of it. It was a lot of fun to play. Yeah, that was great. And working with Bob Hoskins and, again, Bob Zemeckis. I\'ve been lucky.      [2012, on landing Back to the Future (1985)] I was shooting a film in Mexico City that I\'m not sure ever came out. But it was shooting in Mexico City, and I was kind of implanted there, focusing on that, when my agent sent me the script for Back to the Future (1985). I scanned it, but I wasn\'t terribly impressed, mostly because I\'d been offered the chance to go back East and do a play at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven. I\'d be playing Hans Christian Andersen - I grew up with Danny Kaye. And Colleen Dewhurst, an amazing, wonderful actress, was going to be my mother in it, and I just thought, ""I need to go back to my roots."" So I just dismissed the Back to the Future (1985) script. And then a friend who was with me at the time said, ""My mantra has always been to never leave any stone unturned."" In other words, whenever someone has an interest in you, whatever it is, at least check it out. So based on that, I flew back to Los Angeles, met Bob Zemeckis, and the rest is history.      [2012, on working with John Belushi in Goin\' South (1978)] I remember him well. John Belushi was doing Saturday Night Live (1975) at the time, which he had to be in New York to do, and we were shooting Goin\' South (1978) in Durango, Mexico, which meant that for three or four weeks he had to do Saturday Night Live (1975), fly to Durango - which was fairly complicated, because you had to go to Mexico City and then up to Durango - shoot for a couple of days, and then fly back to New York to do Saturday Night Live (1975) again. But he was wonderful to work with. I mean, he was absolutely right for the part. He had a lot of energy, of course. He was great. We had a good routine together. It was cool.      [2012, on Goin\' South (1978)] Well, that happened in a rather interesting way. I was doing a Broadway musical called ""Happy End"", a Bertolt Brecht/Kurt Weill collaboration, and Nicholson was looking for a leading lady, a new actress, to be in Goin\' South (1978), which he was directing. So he came to see ""Happy End"" not knowing I was in it but, rather, to see Meryl Streep, who was my co-star. And I remember after the play, the stage manager said that Jack Nicholson was going to be coming back to my dressing room to say hello. And Meryl Streep was there, and he said that there was a script that he\'d like for me to see, that he\'d like for me to do a part in it. And the film was Goin\' South (1978), and I did it. And ultimately, he found Mary Steenburgen to play the role that he was trying to cast. But it was just fortuitous that he came by that night.      [2012, on filming Dennis the Menace (1993)] I had a scene in that when I\'m walking along an alley and I see a boy eating an apple. I reach over the fence with a big knife and snare the apple, and I eat the apple. And the boy playing that role must have been about six or seven years old - he was horrified of me. Even when I was out of makeup. He\'d hide behind his mother when he saw me just walking as myself. Just absolutely terrified.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nJohn Belushi ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 54 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(5)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(4)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(37)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(4)\xa0|Salary\xa0(2)  Overview (5)Date of Birth24\xa0January1949,\xa0Chicago, Illinois, USA Date of Death5\xa0March1982,\xa0Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA      \xa0(acute cocaine and heroin intoxication)    Birth NameJohn Adam BelushiNicknameAmerica\'s Guest    Height5\'\xa08""\xa0(1.73\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          John Belushi was born in Chicago, Illinois, USA, on January 24, 1949, to Agnes Demetri (Samaras) and Adam Anastos Belushi, a restaurant owner. His father was an Albanian immigrant, from Qytezë, and his mother was also of Albanian descent. He grew up in Wheaton, where the family moved when he was six. Though a young hellion in grade school, John became the perfect all-American boy during his high school years where he was co-captain of the Wheaton Central High School football team and was elected homecoming king his senior year. He also developed an interest in acting and appeared in the high school variety show. Encouraged by his drama teacher, John decided to put aside his plans to become a football coach to pursue a career in acting.After graduation in 1967, John performed in summer stock in rural Indiana in a variety of roles from ""Cardinal Wolsey"" in ""Anne of a Thousand Days"" to a comic detective in ""Ten Little Indians"". In the fall of his freshman year at the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater, John changed his image into a bad-boy appearance by growing his hair long and began to have problems with discipline and structure of attending classes.Dropping out of Wisconsin, John spent the next two years at the College of DuPage, a junior college a few miles from his parents\' Wheaton home, where his father began persuading him to become a partner in his restaurant, but John still preferred acting. While attending DuPage, John helped found the ""West Compass Players"", an improv comedy troupe patterned after Chicago\'s famous ""Second City"" ensemble.In 1971, John made the leap to ""Second City"" itself where he performed in various on-stage comic performances with others, who included Harold Ramis and Joe Flaherty. John loved his life at ""Second City"" where he performed six nights a week, perfecting the physical ""gonzo"" style of comedy he later made famous.A year later, John and his live-in girlfriend from his high school years, Judith Belushi-Pisano, moved to New York because John had joined the cast of National Lampoon\'s Lemmings, an off-Broadway rock musical revue that was originally booked for a six-week run but played to full crowds for nearly 10 months.In 1973, John was hired as a writer for the syndicated National Lampoon\'s Radio Hour which became the National Lampoon Show in 1975. John\'s big break came that same year when he joined the ground-breaking TV variety series Saturday Night Live (1975) which made him a star. The unpredictable, aggressively physical style of humor that he began on ""Second City"" flowered on SNL.In 1978, while still working on Saturday Night Live (1975), John appeared in the movie Goin\' South (1978) which starred and was directed by Jack Nicholson. It was here that director John Landis noticed John and decided to cast him in his movie National Lampoon\'s Animal House (1978). John\'s minor role as the notorious, beer-swilling ""Bluto"" made it a box-office smash and the year\'s top grossing comedy. Despite appearing in only a dozen scenes, John\'s performance stole the movie, which portrays college fraternity shenanigans at a small college set in the year 1962.In 1979, John along with fellow SNL regular Dan Aykroyd quit the series to pursue movie projects. John and Dan Aykroyd appeared in minor roles in Steven Spielberg\'s financially unsuccessful 1941 (1979) and, the following year, in John Landis\' The Blues Brothers (1980). Around this time, John\'s drug use began escalating. Cocaine, which was ubiquitous in show-business circles in the 1970\'s, became his drug of choice. After he first experimented with cocaine in the mid 1970s, John almost immediately became addicted to it. His frequent cocaine sniffing binges became a source of friction between him and Judy, whom he married in 1976.John\'s love for blues and soul music inspired the ""Blues Brothers"". He and Aykroyd first appeared as Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues, a pair of white soul men dressed in black suits, skinny ties, fedora hats and Rayban sunglasses, as a warm-up act before the telecasts of Saturday Night Live (1975). Building on the success of their acts and the release of their album ""A Briefcase Full of Blues"", John and Dan Aykroyd starred in the movie, which gave John a chance to act with his favorite musical heroes including Ray Charles, James Brown and Aretha Franklin.Although John\'s reputation for being an off-screen party animal is legendary, his generous side is less well known. Using some of his money, he bought his father a ranch outside San Diego for him to live. John helped set up some of his Chicago friends with their own businesses and even financially helped his younger brother, Jim Belushi, who followed his older brother\'s path to both ""Second City"" and Saturday Night Live (1975).In 1981, John appeared in the movie Continental Divide (1981), playing a hard-nosed Chicago newspaperman who finds romance in Colorado with eagle expert Blair Brown. That same year, John and Dan Aykroyd appeared again in the movie Neighbors (1981), which gave them a chance to reverse roles, with John playing a straight-arrow family man whose life is turned upside down when a wild family man (Aykroyd) moves in next door.In January 1982, John began work on the screenplay for another movie to be titled ""Noble Rot"". Also, John had checked into a bungalow at the Chateau Marmont, a popular celebrity hotel in Los Angeles. John\'s drug use had been steadily increasing for over a year now, which alarmed his wife and friends, but he continued to promise Judy that he would quit someday. On March 5, 1982, John Belushi was found dead in his hotel room at the age of 33. The local coroner gave the cause of death as a lethal injection of cocaine and heroin. Several years later, John\'s drug dealing/drug user companion during his final weeks, Cathy Smith, was tried and sentenced to three years in prison for supplying John with the drugs. Close friend James Taylor sang ""That Lonesome Road"" at a memorial service at Martha\'s Vineyard cemetery where John was buried.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       matt-282          Spouse (1) Judith Belushi-Pisano (31 December\xa01976            - 5 March\xa01982)\xa0(his death)          Trade Mark (4)        On Saturday Night Live, he often did a running act on the Weekend Update section where he would give an editorial speech that starts calmly, but increases in emotional intensity until the end he is screaming and flailing around like a maniac.        Often played comically intense, volatile, even sometimes sloppy man-child characters.        In his trademark comic rantings, he would include a long, detailed explanation of something he was trying to support or confirm, and then broke into a shouting ""Buuuut nnnnnOOOOOO!"", continuing to rant into the negative.        Often known for his expressive eyes and the solitary raised eyebrowTrivia (37)      Raised in Wheaton, Illinois as a child.      Attended Edison Middle School in Wheaton, Illinois.      Attended Wheaton Central High School, now Wheaton Warrenville South High School, in Wheaton, Illinois.      Following his untimely death, he was interred at Abel\'s Hill Cemetery in Chilmark (on Martha\'s Vineyard), Massachusetts. His grave is unmarked.      Used to borrow a $20 bill from new acquaintances, judging them from their reactions at his request.      Had starred alone in a black and white Saturday Night Live (1975) sketch titled ""Don\'t Look Back in Anger"", in which he played himself as an old man visiting the graves of the other original SNL cast members, himself being the last survivor. In an odd twist of fate, Belushi was the first of the cast to die.      Began his career in Shawnee Summer Theatre of Greene County\'s youth theatre education program, in Bloomfield, Indiana.      Biography in: ""Who\'s Who in Comedy"" by Ronald L. Smith. pg. 38-40. New York: Facts on File, 1992.  ISBN 0816023387      A petition drive was started to have a commemorative stamp printed by the U.S. Postal Service for the actor.      At the time of his untimely death, Belushi was rewriting a script entitled ""Noble Rot"".      4/1/04: Posthumously received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6355 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California. The ceremony was attended by his brother Jim Belushi and friend and partner Dan Aykroyd. Also in attendance were John\'s widow Judith Belushi-Pisano and fellow SNL cast member Chevy Chase.      Made a ""Guest Star Appearance"" on an episode of the television series Police Squad! (1982) which showed him underwater wearing cement shoes. He died shortly before the episode aired, so the scene was cut and replaced by a segment with William Conrad. After the success of the Naked Gun movies in the early 1990s, ABC-TV re-aired episodes of ""Police Squad!"" and hoped to re-edit the Belushi scene back into the episode. However, the footage could not be found and is now presumed lost or destroyed.      Was good friends with fellow Saturday Night Live (1975) player Dan Aykroyd. Belushi personally met with Aykroyd at a speakeasy that Aykroyd frequented to discuss the possibility of Aykroyd joining Saturday Night Live (1975), which is where they hit it off. While they were talking, Aykroyd put on a blues record, which stirred a fascination in Belushi, who was primarily a fan of heavy metal. SNL music director Howard Shore later heard about Aykroyd re-familiarizing Belushi with blues music and suggested that they do a musical sketch, which eventually led to the birth of their popular ""Blues Brothers"" act.      The role of Dr. Peter Venkman in Ghostbusters (1984) was originally written for Belushi. After his death, the role went to fellow SNL player Bill Murray.      Was scheduled to present the first annual Best Visual Effects Oscar at the 1982 Academy Awards with Dan Aykroyd, but died weeks before the ceremony. Aykroyd presented the award alone, and stated from the podium: ""My partner would have loved to have been here tonight to present this award, since he was a bit of a Visual Effect himself."".      His favorite comedienne was Lucille Ball, he knew every detail of her life and career.      Had signed to play a supporting role in Once Upon a Time in America (1984), but died before the film went into production. He was replaced by James Woods.      Was billed as ""Kevin Scott"" on an episode of Saturday Night Live (1975), as a spoof on suggestions that his name Belushi be softened or changed, for the television audience (John\'s Albanian family had kept the name when they came to America, so he wanted to also.).      His good friend Dan Aykroyd used to refer to the green ghost Slimer from Ghostbusters (1984) as ""the ghost of John Belushi"", based on the similar party animal personality.      A scene was deleted from 1941 (1979) in which his character met Dan Aykroyd\'s character right before he boarded the Japanese submarine. They looked at each other as if recognizing each other, a nod to their real life friendship. This was the only scene in the film where they interacted.Chris Farley was an admirer of Belushi and, sadly, Farley too died in his early 30s just when his career appeared to be taking off.      There is a John Belushi Memorial Scholarship for Performing Arts at his alma mater, College of DuPage (Glen Ellyn, Illinois).      The epitaph on Belushi\'s tombstone (on Martha\'s Vineyard, off the coast of Massachusetts) read, ""He made us laugh, and now he can make us think."" John\'s grave drew so many curious viewers that his casket had to be moved and reburied in an unmarked corner of the cemetery... after which Belushi\'s fans posted a new epitaph for him which has since become famous: ""He could have given us a lot more laughs, but NOOOOOOO!"" (This was taken from one of his more-famous catchphrases on Saturday Night Live (1975)).      Attended Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois. He bought his famous ""College"" shirt seen in Animal House (1978) at a small shirt shop on ""The Strip"" (Illinois Street or US Route 51) in Carbondale, which still exists.      His performance as John ""Bluto"" Blutarsky in Animal House (1978) is ranked #48 on Premiere magazine\'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.      Biography in: ""The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives"". Volume One, 1981-1985, pages 61-62. New York: Charles Scribner\'s Sons, 1998.      Older brother of Jim Belushi. Uncle of Robert Belushi.      While co-hosting an episode of Siskel & Ebert & the Movies (1986) with Richard Roeper, longtime friend and collaborator Harold Ramis revealed that it was Belushi\'s longtime ambition to play Ludwig van Beethoven in a feature film.      Belushi died in bungalow #3 of the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles. The last two stars to see him alive were Robert De Niro and Robin Williams, both of whom had visited Belushi, on separate occasions, shortly before his death.      The Polish rock group Lady Pank (who provided the music for the animated series O dwóch takich, co ukradli ksiezyc (1962)) wrote a song called ""John Belushi"", which appears on the album ""Tacy Sami"". The tune was composed by Jan Borysewicz and the lyrics were written by Zbigniew Holdys.      Was very generous, financially, to family and friends, often loaning them money when they asked. Toward the end of his life, Belushi\'s business manager asked him to contact several family and friends and generate money by demanding they make good on their loans. Belushi refused.      Had appeared with Michael O\'Donoghue in ""Wolverines"", the very first sketch on the first SNL show in 1975.      He discovered the band Fear and brought them to Cherokee Studios to record songs for the soundtrack of a major motion picture, he and Dan Aykroyd were starring in, called Neighbors (1981).      John was the original choice to be Dan Aykroyd\'s co-star in Spies Like Us (1985) (in the role that eventually went to Chevy Chase). Aykroyd and Belushi discussed the upcoming movie with Gene Shalit on Today (1952); the clip is included as a special feature on the ""Best of John Belushi"" DVD.      Was good friends with Wrestling Legend Dusty Rhodes.      Belushi\'s nickname ""America\'s Guest"" stemmed from his habit of wandering to a random house of a complete stranger, knocking on the door, going in, helping himself to something in the refrigerator and then sleeping on the stranger\'s couch. Most strangers, recognizing who he was, did not seem to mind Belushi\'s ""visit"".      Since Albania was under communism during his youth, Belushi often told people he was of Greek and Italian descent.Personal Quotes (4)      Some comedians love their characters.

If you realize that a movie critique represents an INDIVIDUAL'S opinion
which may be very different from your own, you probably also don't take
these comments too seriously.  But - for what it's worth - here's mine re:
Goin' South:  I found it very entertaining (and I'm probably fussier than
most when it comes to movies).  That's what I value most in a film:
entertainment.  Any negative comments about this flick come from the more
erudite crowd which knows or looks deeper for such things.  I was even
able
to get past Nicholson's character's need for a good nose-blowin', which
usually really bothers me, but, in this case, I found it utterly
hilarious.

something good about this picture because I think that it richly deserves

Mary Steenburgen had been working as a waitress in an Arizona dinner

I think there is some very touching scenes between Nicholson and

Going' South is probably most famous as being a film directed by Jack
Nicholson. It's a western about an outlaw called Henry Moon who is
saved from execution by a sexually repressed woman who owns a gold
mine. To his chagrin she immediately sets him to work there, needless
to say they don't get along at first but then they do later on.<br><br>This is essentially an odd couple film. It plays things consistently
for laughs but like the majority of comedy westerns it really isn't too
funny. Nicholson may be a great actor but he isn't a very good
director. The pacing lags badly in the second half but the story isn't
terribly engaging overall. It also stars a host of actors who would go
on to become stars in the 80's such as Danny Devito, John Belushi and
Christopher Lloyd. But despite the potential that this cast suggests,
most have very under-developed roles and it feels suspiciously like
Nicholson invited them along just so that he could have a laugh on set.
The western itself was in decline by the late 70's in any case and
Going' South didn't bring anything new to the table to help change
that. It's a film that seems to have a minor cult reputation but I
didn't think it was too good and it's certainly one of Nicholson's
lesser film outings.

""Goin' South"" is a watchable comedy directed by and starring Jack
Nicholson. Filmed cheaply with a local crew down in Mexico, the film
wasn't received well upon release. ""Star Wars"" had rendered westerns
obsolete and screwball comedies were long out of date.<br><br>Still, ""Goin' South"" holds up pretty well. Nichsolson's performance is
amazing and cinematographer Néstor Almendros equals his work on
Terrence Malick's ""Days of Heaven"".<br><br>The film works more as a bizarre insight into Jack Nicholson, than a
comedy. He turns what should be light slapstick, into a pretty nasty
and mean spirited R rated comedy-drama. Watching his filmography from
end to end, I'm surprised how consistently wicked and misogynistic his
characters are. Here he players an outlaw who's hired by a sexually
repressed woman to work in her gold mines. After tying her to a bed and
giving her the hump of her life, she renounces her repressed ways and
gradually begins to appreciate his animalistic masculinity.<br><br>The Jack Nicholson persona seems to constantly be seeking to dominate
women. If he can't have his way, he breaks down. ""Goin South"" is like a
happy version of his ""Carnal Knowledge"", only here he finally gets a
girl who submits to his primal charm.<br><br>In terms of comedy, the film is similar in tone to the Coen Brothers'
""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" It's not as visually stylish, but the
emphasis on wacky accents is the same. The cast includes Danny Devito,
John Belushi and Christopher Lloyd, and many other comic faces pop up.<br><br>But it's Jack Nicholson's face that keeps us watching. He's manic,
cartoonish, sadistic and riveting. Take a look at the IMDb photo of
this film (the DVD cover). The guy looks like a bearded Saddam Hussein,
laughing at his hang man's noose like a psychopath. Nicholson's face is
a work of art. His eyebrows are constantly twitching, his eyes
constantly mischievous, his teeth lighting up his face. Whether you
enjoy the film will depend on whether you love his scenery chewing. He
puts so much energy and skill into his performance here that he
transcends everything else about this film.<br><br>6/10- Worth one viewing. I recommend fast forwarding all the exposition
and simply watching Jack act. The guy's a pleasure to watch.

I rarely see the same movie more than once. Although I love movies,
repeated viewings tend to be tedious and boring. Not so this wonderful
picture which was Jack Nicholson's directing debut. I watch Going'
South over and over and find something new each time. I believe that is
one mark of a well-made and well-written movie.<br><br>From the opening scenes with Moon's horse keeling over as he dances
celebrating his ""get away"" to the tender moments between Moon and Julia
after they divide up the gold, I find this movie gives and keeps on
giving.<br><br>Henry Moon's lines are hilarious and delivered only as Jack can do.
Mary Steenburgen delivers a performance as good as any first time to
the screen and the other characters are played wonderfully by current
and soon-to-be stars of TV and cinema.<br><br>I love turning people on to this movie. I never get tired of watching

Released in 1978 and directed by Jack Nicholson, ""Goin' South"" is a
Western comedy/romance starring Nicholson as a two-bit outlaw saved
from hanging to marry a prim virgin (Mary Steenburgen) who uses him to
(try to) strike gold on the mine located on her remote ranch, inherited
from her dad. But the ex-outlaw's former gang might not let him strike
it rich, whether with gold or love. The wannabe outlaws are played by
Veronica Cartwright, Tracey Walter, Danny DeVito and Jeff Morris.<br><br>The tone is akin to 1976's ""The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox,"" but not
as good. It's generally amusing, but sometimes a little boring; the
script needed more work to further draw out its potential. Yet it's
still worth catching if you like the cast. There are some chuckles. The

Two years later he was teaching full-time and running a number of martial-arts schools. His students included Steve McQueen, Priscilla Presley and the Osmonds.Norris\'s fight career lasted from 1964-1974. Norris started off by losing his first three tournaments but, by 1966, he was almost unbeatable. Among the numerous titles he won were The National Karate Championships (1966), All-Star Championships (1966), World Middleweight Karate Championship (1967), All-American Karate Championship (1967), Internationals (1968), World Professional Middleweight Karate Championship (defeating Louis Delgado on 24 November 1968), All-American Championship (1968), National Tournament of Champions (1968), American Tang Soo Championship, and the North American Karate Championship.

Eldest of three sons born to Ray and Wilma Norris. Chuck\'s brothers are Wieland Norris (born July 12, 1943; KIA in Vietnam, 1970) and Aaron Norris. Aaron is the youngest of the trio, the proverbial ""runt of the litter.""      Father of Mike Norris and Eric Norris, the latter of whom is a professional stock car driver. Their mother is Diane Holechek. Chuck also has a daughter named Dianna DeCioli (Dina). Dina was born in 1964, due to an extramarital affair when he was stationed in California in the US Air Force. More recently, on August 30, 2001, Chuck and Gena O\'Kelly (his second wife) welcomed twins Dakota Alan (boy) and Danilee Kelly (girl).      Often trained with Bruce Lee.      6-time World Karate Champion; among those he faced for this title are fellow actors Joe Lewis and Steve Sanders.      He was the karate teacher of father-son actors Steve McQueen and Chad McQueen. The elder McQueen encouraged Norris to pursue a career in movies and television; allegedly, he told Chuck: ""If you can\'t do anything else, there\'s always acting.""      12/12/01: Received ""Veteran of the Year 2001"" honor at the 6th Annual American Veteran Awards.      In the movies where he\'s a police officer, Norris usually prefers to work alone (i.e. Lone Wolf McQuade (1983), Code of Silence (1985) and Top Dog (1995)).      Has 3 grandchildren by son Eric Norris. Also has three grandchildren by daughter Dianna DeCioli. One of the grandchildren is fellow actress Gabby Di Ciolli.      He has founded two of his own martial arts: Chun Kuk Do (""the Universal Way"") and American Tang Soo Do.      He is the Founder of the National Tang-Soo-Do Congress (NTC) and the United Fighting Arts Federation (UFAF). Chuck is also President of the latter.      He has a 10th degree black belt in Tang Soo Do, and also an 8th degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do...that is, the Korean (or traditional) styles of each.      His father Ray was killed in a car accident, shortly after cancer surgery. Part of Ray\'s throat and chin were removed; a tube was inserted in his trachea to help him breathe. Ray was thrown out of his car in the wreck, and the tube came out. Ray suffocated on the ground because no one at the accident site was aware of the tube.      His voice and drama coach was Jonathan Harris, of Lost in Space (1965) fame. Harris ""taught him how to speak,"" by putting his fingers in Norris\'s mouth, and stretching the mouth wide open. Chuck names Jonathan as the only man in the world who could get away with doing that to him... which Harris was always proud of.      It is commonly believed that he was offered the role of ""Sensei Jon Kreese"" in the original The Karate Kid (1984). He reportedly turned it down, claiming he did not want his name connected with such a brutal and vicious character. This is, in fact, an urban legend; Norris himself has disputed it. While appearing on the February 9, 2006 episode of the radio show hosted by Adam Carolla, Norris stated that he was never offered the role at all.      Despite their vast political differences, he is friends with actress and comedienne Whoopi Goldberg. He was so impressed with a performance of hers that he tried, unsuccessfully, to get her a role in his film Invasion U.S.A. (1985).      Reader\'s Digest once noted a story of how Norris, true to his characters, prefers to find a non-violent way to solve a situation. Norris was in a bar once when a customer walked in and said to him, ""You\'re in my seat. Move."" Norris complied, and as the customer sat down, he recognized Norris. He then said, ""Chuck, you could\'ve kicked my butt if you wanted to. Instead of moving, why didn\'t you just attack me?"" Norris\' response: ""What would that have accomplished?"" Norris later said the experience resulted in him getting a new admirer and a new friend.      Is a Black Belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu under the Machado Brothers.      As a child, his idol and favorite actor was John Wayne. Indeed, their on screen personas bear much in common. Both achieved their highest level of fame playing no nonsense good guys who were incorruptible and did whatever it took to make sure that justice was served and that the bad guys got what they deserved.      He is a staunch supporter of the Republican Party.      Is an NRA member.      Is a close friend of legendary writer and director John Milius, who was an uncredited co-screenwriter of Norris\'s movie Lone Wolf McQuade (1983). Milius credits this film, in part with inspiring him to craft the similar Extreme Prejudice (1987), four years later.      Enjoys playing golf and participates in many celebrity golfing events.      A website known as ""Chuck Norris Facts"" has been created as a parody of his career, containing hundreds of absurdly creative statements about his intellect, strength, virility and image, such as \'Chuck Norris once shot down a German fighter plane by pointing at it and yelling ""Bang!"".\' Chuck is not offended by the website, in fact, has said he feels honored to have a website named after him and says he laughs when he reads the facts. He even used one fact in The Expendables 2 (2012): \'Chuck Norris was once bitten by a cobra. After five days of agonizing pain, the cobra finally died.\'.

I was never a natural athlete, but I paid my dues in sweat and concentration and took the time necessary to learn karate and become world champion.      It\'s the bullies who are afraid, are the ones that do all the fighting. It\'s not the secure kids that get out there and fight. It\'s the insecure kids. And when you develop that security in these youngsters and all of a sudden they have no reason to fight . . . This is to me the most gratifying thing I\'ve ever been able to do.      Today, more than ever, the inspiration for the parts I play is found in you - our nation\'s men and women in uniform and the selfless contributions you make on a daily basis to keep our country safe and free. I salute you.      I haven\'t always been warmly welcomed for holding my conservative positions in Hollywood. Then again, I\'ve never been very good at being politically correct either, on or off screen. So why start now?      For too many years I was in rebellion to God. Now I\'m a rebel with a cause for God and for grassroots America. I no longer fit the mold. I\'m not a liberal actor from Hollywood. I\'m not politically correct, in my opinions or my practice. And though I\'m concerned with what people think, I will not compromise the truth in any form to cater to others, even with religion and politics. Those who would merely brand me on the Right are oversimplifying and running from the real issue.      Alleged Chuck Norris Fact: ""There is no theory of evolution. Just a list of creatures Chuck Norris has allowed to live."" It\'s funny. It\'s cute. But here\'s what I really think about the theory of evolution: It\'s not real. It is not the way we got here. In fact, the life you see on this planet is really just a list of creatures God has allowed to live. We are not creations of random chance. We are not accidents. There is a God, a Creator, who made you and me. We were made in His image, which separates us from all other creatures.      Alleged Chuck Norris Fact: ""Faster than a speeding bullet ... more powerful than a locomotive ... able to leap tall buildings in a single bound... yes, these are some of Chuck Norris\' warm-up exercises."" I\'ve got a bulletin for you, folks. I am no superman. I realize that now, but I didn\'t always. As six-time world karate champion and then a movie star, I put too much trust in who I was, what I could do and what I acquired. I forgot how much I needed others and especially God. Whether we are famous or not, we all need God. We also need other people.      Alleged Chuck Norris Fact: ""Chuck Norris\' tears can cure cancer. Too bad he never cries. Ever."" There was a man whose tears could cure cancer or any other disease, including the real cause of all diseases - sin. His blood did. His name was Jesus, not Chuck Norris. If your soul needs healing, the prescription you need is not Chuck Norris\' tears, it\'s Jesus\' blood.      [on Bruce Lee] Bruce Lee had bad eyesight and one leg that was shorter than the other. But he had a mental image of what he wanted, and he became the quintessential martial artist and the first Chinese superstar in American films.      There are a dozen death spots, another dozen paralyzing death spots, and many, many disabling spots on the body. We human beings are quite fragile, you know.      After years of learning to control my emotions in karate, I found it very difficult to reverse that process and fully express them. But I learn from my mistakes and develop more as an actor with each film role.      I don\'t initiate violence, I retaliate.      There has always been violence on the screen, and certain groups claim that some antisocial behavior can be traced to these violent films. I believe that\'s hogwash. The violence on television news programs is much more harmful because it\'s real. We all have the potential to be violent, but we must learn to control these impulses.      Any GOP candidate can be dissected to a point that he is railed for having liberal tendencies. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has waffled enough around his pro-abortion, pro-gay, pro-gun control views to recruit many Democratic supporters. Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney has flip-flopped so many times on issues of abortion, immigration and gay rights to make one wonder for what party he\'s running. Texas Representative Ron Paul\'s bent toward being an isolationist who wants to bring home every one of our 572,000 troops abroad makes the anti-terror, pro-military hairs on the back of my neck stand. Though Senator John McCain of Arizona is a friend and a true, decorated hero who I personally think would make an excellent vice president for Mike, he opposed the Bush tax cuts and co-authored legislation for comprehensive immigration reform that some believe jeopardizes national security and American sovereignty. And while former Tennessee Senator Fred Dalton Thompson is also a friend, his record of consistently voting against tort reform, opposing the impeachment of Bill Clinton on perjury, supporting opponents of Ronald Reagan [Gerald Ford and James Baker III] in 1976 and 1980, and failing to support federal constitutional amendments that would ban abortion and gay marriage doesn\'t exactly make him ""the only true conservative."" To be fair, even if Reagan himself were running today, he likely couldn\'t dodge liberal labeling, especially for his signing of the Immigration Control and Reform Act of 1986, which granted amnesty to aliens who resided in the U.S. since before 1982.      [on Sen. John McCain] If John takes over the presidency at seventy-two and he ages 3-to-1, how old will he be in four years? Eighty-four years old--and can he handle that kind of pressure in that job? That\'s why I didn\'t pick John to support, because I\'m just afraid the Vice President will wind up taking over his job within that four-year presidency.      I\'ve known John McCain for over twenty years. He\'s a man of integrity, but a lot of his social issues, I didn\'t lean toward. I\'m not a Republican or Democrat. I\'m conservative. Now that John has brought someone like Sarah Palin on the ticket, it makes me more confident that they could do a tremendous job in the White House.      My choice would be John McCain and Sarah Palin mainly because, with Sarah, I think she\'d make a good president because she\'s a no-nonsense gal and she has much more experience than Barack Obama. Europe now is not infatuated with Barack Obama anymore. They are infatuated with Sarah Palin.      I admire those in the recent past who were able to represent a respectful conservatism in a liberal-leaning, show-business industry: men like Charlton Heston, John Wayne, James Stewart and Ronald Reagan. And I\'m grateful for others today who have also stood for conservative values, incredible actors like Jim Caviezel, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight. Jon has recently stepped up to the plate for thousands of others who can\'t because they\'d be cast aside by casting directors if their conservatism was even made known. Jon is taking the brunt end for them from critics who have no tolerance for actors on the right. These are the type of men who will go against the grain of the Hollywood status quo. These are the type of men who get the fact that entertainment isn\'t about playing party politics. These are the type of men who demonstrate what my hero and the stalwart conservative John Wayne once said, ""Courage is being scared to death, and saddling up anyway.""      I think we\'re heading down the wrong direction. We need to restore patriotism as the founders meant it to be. We need to restore our sense of stability, morality and our responsibility. I think we have drifted from that. We just need to get back like our founding fathers. I do a lot of reading about our founding fathers and on our history, you know. They had a vision for America that was not corrupted by greed and power and I think unfortunately many of our politicians have fallen into that trap.      I may run for president of Texas. That need may be a reality sooner than we think. If not me, someone someday may again be running for president of the Lone Star state, if the state of the union continues to turn into the enemy of the state. Anyone who has been around Texas for any length of time knows exactly what we\'d do if the going got rough in America.      With The Expendables 2 (2012), you have a lot of hard language in there that means that young people won\'t be able to see it. I said, I don\'t do movies like that. I didn\'t do them in the past, I didn\'t do them on my TV series. I said, you have to cut out all the hardcore language or I can\'t do it. So they did, and Expendables is now a PG-13 film so kids can see it.      [on Silent Rage] It was about a psycho who couldn\'t die. It\'s amazing that out of all my films, it\'s the one that makes the most people come up to me and say, ""Are you going to do a sequel?"" I say: ""What would I do? I tried every way in the world to kill that guy. Finally, I had to dump him down a well. There\'s nothing else I could do to him.""      [on Invasion U.S.A.] That\'s the one I shot in Atlanta and Miami. I wrote that screenplay [after] I got the story out of a Reader\'s Digest, which talked about what would happen if terrorists came into our country and started blowing up schools and buses and airplanes - things that would isolate our transportation system. [It was like] 9/11. Of course, in the film it was the Russians who were trying to scare us into not leaving our homes. And I saved the day.      [on Code of Silence][Code of Silence] was my biggest critical success. I played a cop in Chicago, and Dennis Farina was one of my co-stars. It was probably the first movie where the critics really praised me. They called me the next John Wayne.      [on Return of the Dragon] Yeah, that was amazing. Bruce had left for Hong Kong to pursue his movie career, and I didn\'t hear from him for a couple of years. Then he called me out of the blue and asked if I would be his opponent in this new movie, which he was directing, as well. He said, ""I\'m going to do this big fight scene in the Colosseum in Rome - a fight to the death, like two gladiators."" And kiddingly I went, ""Well, who wins, Bruce?"" And he said, ""I win; I\'m the star of this movie."" I said, ""Oh, I see."" Because I held the world title then, I said, ""So you want to beat the world champion?"" And he said, ""No, I want to kill the world champion."" I said, ""Oh ... OK.""      [on Delta Force] That was a good one, too, because it was a privilege to work with Lee Marvin. He was an incredible guy, a real macho guy. He was known for criticizing everybody - all his co-stars - and he never said nice things. Then they interviewed him right after we did Delta Force and asked him about me. He said: ""I liked him. He was a cool guy."" So I thought, ""Thank goodness.""      [on Hero and the Terror] That was shot here in Los Angeles. It was a scary movie. The bad guy was a monster, a huge guy. It was OK, but it wasn\'t one of my favorites.      [on Top Dog] It was interesting working with a dog - even though they always say, ""Never work with dogs or children."" This dog was incredibly smart. I was doing a scene where the dog and I were running, and we both had our marks to land on. I ran up and looked - and missed my mark by two or three feet - but the dog landed right on his. And they said, ""Chuck, if a dog can land on his, you can sure as heck land on yours!""      I have to say I\'m proud of them all. My favorite? That\'s a tough one because each has a special [meaning] to me. The Missing in Action films were very special because they were really the ones that [took] me to a higher level [where I was] more in demand. They helped spearhead my career. Of course, Code of Silence is special because it was a critical success. And Lone Wolf McQuade was a fun film.      Listen, you\'ve got to be 21 to be smoking a cigar in the first place. And smoking a cigar is an experience, not like smoking a pack of cigarettes every day. A cigar is for relaxation. I do enjoy cigar smoking and I\'m old enough to smoke. Anything done in excess is going to be bad for you, whether it\'s eating, drinking or whatever. The key to enjoying cigar smoking is moderation. I\'m not going to hide out in some back room and tell the world that I don\'t smoke cigars. I\'m not going to lie about it.      I don\'t approve of athletes or celebrities who say that they don\'t want to be a role model for children. The kids still look up to them, and the least they can do is not allow their lives to go in a negative direction. They have a responsibility to children whether they like it or not. And I think they should adhere to that responsibility.      I think kids today need someone to emulate, because a lot of times they don\'t have that at home. Kids have to find it elsewhere. And a lot of kids today look in a negative direction. They look up to drug addicts, gang members, because they don\'t have positive role models.      After I did Good Guys Wear Black, the critics said it was the worst acting in the history of movie making. But people went to see that movie, and I think it was because the lead character was a strong, positive, heroic role model. A guy who was pretty much in the same category as Walker. A guy who fights against whatever injustices there may be and uses his abilities as a martial artist to do it. My concepts haven\'t changed much over the years. But we must be doing something right, because every week about a billion people around the world are watching Walker, Texas Ranger.      Success in show business is misleading. You can be here today and gone tomorrow. One day they want to see you, the next day they could care less. That\'s the way it is. You never know when that day is gonna come when people say, \'I\'ve seen all I want to see of that guy.\' I started later in life. I was 36 before I got into the film business and at that time I had already achieved a modicum of success in the martial arts world. So when I went into films I was already pretty centered. Understanding the philosophy of life means that success can be very fleeting and you just do the best you can. Work as hard as you can and just see what happens with all that. If it\'s successful, great. If it\'s not, move on. I\'ve never really let the pressure get to me.Salary (4)Breaker!

Lester was never rude to me, but I didn\'t like his attitude toward filmmaking. Lester had his way of making movies, God bless him, but to me, he was nowhere near as professional as Donner. Donner was a pro who knew his job and did his homework. Superman II is a great movie, but it would have been better if they went with the Donner version.

I thought he was a bit of an asshole. But, when he got hurt, my heart went out to him and I\'ve seen the courage he gave people. And that was magic. So he did do something with his life that was kind of good and for that, I give him a lot of credit. I can\'t be a hypocrite, I\'m not going to say we were best friends and all that shit, because we weren\'t.      Christopher was all right. But he wasn\'t one of my favorite people. He was a 170 pound skinny kid and I gave David Prowse, a good guy, some suggestions on how to build him up. But after he built him up, Christopher started walking around like a \'serious guy\'. We had a couple of confrontations. He was a 28 year old with a 16 year old brain. Christopher was rude to a lot of people, but he didn\'t dare act that way with me. I had him against the wall one day because of something that he said. Dick(Richard Donner)came running up. ""Please, Jack. Don\'t hit him in the face!"" Christopher and I sorted it out. I told him ""If you talk about me again, you put \'Mister\' in front of my name, sonny. And don\'t even say ""Hello"" to me unless I tell you to! We never had another problem, but then I never really rapped with him after that. I didn\'t care for him. I\'m not trying to knock a dead guy, and I empathize with what he went through after the accident. I give him credit from the time that he got hurt, though he did many things that helped many people. That was magic and he conducted himself brilliantly. For that I give him five stars. I applaud him for how he helped people. They asked me to come when he got his star on Hollywood Boulevard, but what could I say? I\'m not going to be a hypocrite.

This time Chuck Norris confronting an ominous psycho-killer . A
sensible but two-fisted cop (Chuck Norris) and his tough helper (Steve
James) pit a dangerous series killer who holds a supernatural force .
The police named Danny O'Brien is back in action fighting the notorious
psychotic Simon Moon (Jack O'Halloran) , also known as ¨The Terror¨ who
murders his victims by twisting their necks . The monstrous and
virtually indestructible man is a Frankestein-alike , acting similarly
to Jason Vorhees and Michael Myers .<br><br>This Chuck Norris vehicle contains action-packed , thrills , chills and
lots of blood and violence . Chuck Norris demonstrates his qualities as
an action hero on the fights against the largest-than-life murderous by
means of punches , kicks , bounds and leaps . This is last film that
Menahem Golan , from Cannon film company , produced with Chuck Norris .
Large support cast formed by usual secondaries of the 80s such as Steve
James , Jeffrey Kramer , Billy Drago , Branscome Richmond and Ron
O'Neal as the Mayor . David Michael Frank's screeching musical score
was composed by means of synthesizer . The motion picture was regularly
directed by William Tannen . This horror-fighting-thriller is an
inferior Norris film , in spite of it he was on his best period with
hits such as ¨The Octagon¨ , ¨An eye for an eye¨ , ¨Forced vengeance¨ ,
¨Lone Wolf MacQuade¨ , and ¨Missing in action¨ , among others . Rating
: Below average but entertaining . The picture will appeal to Chuck
Norris fans though results to be one of his inferior outings .

Years ago, cop Chuck Norris captured serial killer Simon Moon, a.k.a.
""The Terror."" This made him a local hero dubbed ""Hero"" by the press.
Now The Terror is back and Hero has to stop him. This is a somewhat
different movie for Chuck than his other '80s movies. He attempts to
play a more layered and sensitive guy this time around. Sure he does
spin-kicks and the like, but he also wears sweaters and goes shopping
with his pregnant girlfriend Brynn Thayer (one of Matlock's daughters).
Jack O'Halloran plays The Terror. Steve James takes time out from being
Michael Dudikoff's sidekick in the American Ninja movies to being
Chuck's partner here. Billy Drago also appears in a surprisingly
non-villainous role. Chuck gets a lot of flack for a variety of reasons
but his '80s movies were usually entertaining. This is no exception.
It's not high art but it is a fun cop movie.

Out of the ordinary for Norris? In a way it does feel like it, but
still those sweaty and muscle-bound elements are still evident but in a
lesser tone. Norris does kick some ass, but he plays a scarred,
guilt-ridden and unsure character that doesn't see himself as some sort
of hero (the media portrays) with the main focus being on the welfare
of his girlfriend and their expected baby. Some might say that it's a
sombre performance with little emotion, but it's a heartfelt turn that
you feel every aching and haunting thought. Complementing that broad
complexion is David Michael Frank's score, which is always there and
holds a sorrow edge. The story builds upon its material with a humane
angle, as Norris battles the demons (spares us some wry relationship
humour) while the killer (the terror) is mainly a lumbering shadow that
emits terror in the most basic and raw way. It's primal and old-fashion
police-killer premise, but stays stimulating throughout. That's not
discarding some repetitive and contrived inclusions, and how the killer
does feel secondary to Norris. William Tannen's direction gradually
forms suspense and moves quick enough (even with some useless spots).
The action isn't eye-opening, but it's a sturdy display with moments of
atmospheric lashings and the setting in a renovated movie theatre is a
nice touch. The violence is quick, with the killer providing a sure
cure for neck problems. An above-par cast do a sound job. Brynn Thayer
excels as Norris' girlfriend. Jack O'Halloran's animalistic, brute
physique is his performance and Steve James is enjoyable too. Rounding
the cast off; Ryan O'Neil, Jeffrey Kramer, Murphy Dunne and a short,
but important see-in for Billy Drago (this guy has presence) who
explains the creepy and unsettling nature of the wanted killer.

I bought this movie probably like three years ago and always picked it
up looking at the cover wanting to watch it, but never did. I went
through a cannon phase where i bought a bunch of cannon movies to watch
with my buddies.We would watch a cannon film, crack open a few beers,
watch, laugh and enjoy. I bought all the Death Wishes(the first one is
not by cannon and is actually legit) and a bunch of chucks. We got
drunk and laughed at all the super cheese. Invasion USA is a fave. Well
anyways i watched this one by myself and i have to say it really
surprised me. I found myself shocked by how much i was enjoying it! Its
not even cheesy. Its well directed and has a pretty good cast to it.
This is hands down, actually a LEGIT Chuck Norris movie. Not your
standard comedy act. Chuck acts very well here. Very likable with (lol
im not kidding) some depth. All in all i loved it. LOL even the ending
song which sounds like it could be in a sylvester stallone 80's
movie(Cobra, First Blood,lol Over the Top). So what im saying, is check
it out. It'll surprise ya. Ide give a 7.5 outta ten. cant do that here

WOW! I've heard many negative reviews of this film but holy cow is it a nail
biter! Chuck Norris is at his prime in this movie, a performance he was only
able to top in Delta Force One and Two. Billy Drago, as Doctor Highwater,
leads a solid supporting cast in making this movie a huge success. Every
time Chuck and Billy team up they create an explosion of action and emotion.
I've watched this movie several times and every time I come away with
something new I have learned about the characters or the plot itself. This
movie has an awful high babe factor as well. Bottom line: Drago and Norris
are an hit on screen!

Chuck Norris takes on a serial killer in this enjoyable action
thriller. Okay, it's no Silent Rage . . . . . . . but what is? Fans of
the mighty Chuck will find enough to enjoy as he launches his patented
flying kicks. Steve James is also on hand to look tough and praise our
hero, who is literally nicknamed hero at various times throughout
(hence the title).<br><br>HERO AND THE TERROR is probably one of the weaker Norris/Cannon
collaborations, but still it's worth a watch if you think of it as a
watered- down version of SILENT RAGE.. sounds like a good idea, which-
let's face it- is.<br><br>Not one of his most exciting films, but definitely one of his better
films, considering everything after this was going straight to video. A
solid opening and a killer ending make up for the fact that there's
very little action in this, as it tries to go for more of a
thriller/drama vibe, in which case it only half-succeeds.<br><br>Hero and the Terror' was a slight departure for the action star  one
that offered more psychological drama than punches and kicks. Still, I
actually like the movie enough to say it's worth a look, particularly

Cop Danny O'Brien (Chuck Norris) starts having nightmares about his
heroic arrest of serial killer Simon Moon (Jack O'Halloran) from three
years prior. This is bad news because it is messing up his relationship
with his pregnant psychiatrist girlfriend Kay (Brynn Thayer). Oh, and
it also sucks because Moon has escaped from prison and started killing
again while hiding out inside a recently remodeled movie theater in
downtown Los Angeles. <br><br>Norris only did a few films in his career that fell under the horror
category (this, SILENT RAGE, HELLBOUND); if SILENT RAGE was his take on
FRANKENSTEIN, then HERO AND THE TERROR is Chuck's PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.
Of course, I'm a sucker for any horror movie set in a theater, so I
still enjoyed this on a revisit even if it isn't very good. Moon has
all the personality of Andrew from HELL NIGHT (1981) and the same
""heavy on the corpses and candles"" home design sensibilities as Jason
circa Friday THE 13th PART 2 (1981). Novelist Michael Blodgett adapted
his own book for this along with co-writer Dennis Shryack, who has some
good horror credits with THE CAR (1977) and MURDER BY PHONE (1982). The
plot is pretty flimsy and the drama between Norris and his crazy
seeming fiancé is really rough. Their birthday dinner scene is really
odd to the point I was screaming for Norris to ditch this crazy chick.
Also, the idea that Norris is the only one who believes the killer is
in the theater after three mysterious deaths is laughable. Still, there
are some memorable bits including a final showdown that fulfills my
wildest theater setting fantasies. Co-starring Steve James as Norris'
partner and Ron O'Neal as The Mayor.

Joe Guzaldo (who acted with Chuck in ""Code of Silence""), Murphy Dunne

crew deserve some credit for doing something a little different; you
don't see him in the position of actually being intimidated by his

This time Chuck Norris confronting an ominous psycho-killer . A
sensible but two-fisted cop (Chuck Norris) and his tough helper (Steve
James) pit a dangerous series killer who holds a supernatural force .
The police named Danny O'Brien is back in action fighting the notorious
psychotic Simon Moon (Jack O'Halloran) , also known as ¨The Terror¨ who
murders his victims by twisting their necks . The monstrous and
virtually indestructible man is a Frankestein-alike , acting similarly
to Jason Vorhees and Michael Myers .<br><br>This Chuck Norris vehicle contains action-packed , thrills , chills and
lots of blood and violence . Chuck Norris demonstrates his qualities as
an action hero on the fights against the largest-than-life murderous by
means of punches , kicks , bounds and leaps . This is last film that
Menahem Golan , from Cannon film company , produced with Chuck Norris .
Large support cast formed by usual secondaries of the 80s such as Steve
James , Jeffrey Kramer , Billy Drago , Branscome Richmond and Ron
O'Neal as the Mayor . David Michael Frank's screeching musical score
was composed by means of synthesizer . The motion picture was regularly
directed by William Tannen . This horror-fighting-thriller is an
inferior Norris film , in spite of it he was on his best period with
hits such as ¨The Octagon¨ , ¨An eye for an eye¨ , ¨Forced vengeance¨ ,
¨Lone Wolf MacQuade¨ , and ¨Missing in action¨ , among others . Rating
: Below average but entertaining . The picture will appeal to Chuck
Norris fans though results to be one of his inferior outings .

Years ago, cop Chuck Norris captured serial killer Simon Moon, a.k.a.
""The Terror."" This made him a local hero dubbed ""Hero"" by the press.
Now The Terror is back and Hero has to stop him. This is a somewhat
different movie for Chuck than his other '80s movies. He attempts to
play a more layered and sensitive guy this time around. Sure he does
spin-kicks and the like, but he also wears sweaters and goes shopping
with his pregnant girlfriend Brynn Thayer (one of Matlock's daughters).
Jack O'Halloran plays The Terror. Steve James takes time out from being
Michael Dudikoff's sidekick in the American Ninja movies to being
Chuck's partner here. Billy Drago also appears in a surprisingly
non-villainous role. Chuck gets a lot of flack for a variety of reasons
but his '80s movies were usually entertaining. This is no exception.
It's not high art but it is a fun cop movie.

Out of the ordinary for Norris? In a way it does feel like it, but
still those sweaty and muscle-bound elements are still evident but in a
lesser tone. Norris does kick some ass, but he plays a scarred,
guilt-ridden and unsure character that doesn't see himself as some sort
of hero (the media portrays) with the main focus being on the welfare
of his girlfriend and their expected baby. Some might say that it's a
sombre performance with little emotion, but it's a heartfelt turn that
you feel every aching and haunting thought. Complementing that broad
complexion is David Michael Frank's score, which is always there and
holds a sorrow edge. The story builds upon its material with a humane
angle, as Norris battles the demons (spares us some wry relationship
humour) while the killer (the terror) is mainly a lumbering shadow that
emits terror in the most basic and raw way. It's primal and old-fashion
police-killer premise, but stays stimulating throughout. That's not
discarding some repetitive and contrived inclusions, and how the killer
does feel secondary to Norris. William Tannen's direction gradually
forms suspense and moves quick enough (even with some useless spots).
The action isn't eye-opening, but it's a sturdy display with moments of
atmospheric lashings and the setting in a renovated movie theatre is a
nice touch. The violence is quick, with the killer providing a sure
cure for neck problems. An above-par cast do a sound job. Brynn Thayer
excels as Norris' girlfriend. Jack O'Halloran's animalistic, brute
physique is his performance and Steve James is enjoyable too. Rounding
the cast off; Ryan O'Neil, Jeffrey Kramer, Murphy Dunne and a short,
but important see-in for Billy Drago (this guy has presence) who
explains the creepy and unsettling nature of the wanted killer.

I bought this movie probably like three years ago and always picked it
up looking at the cover wanting to watch it, but never did. I went
through a cannon phase where i bought a bunch of cannon movies to watch
with my buddies.We would watch a cannon film, crack open a few beers,
watch, laugh and enjoy. I bought all the Death Wishes(the first one is
not by cannon and is actually legit) and a bunch of chucks. We got
drunk and laughed at all the super cheese. Invasion USA is a fave. Well
anyways i watched this one by myself and i have to say it really
surprised me. I found myself shocked by how much i was enjoying it! Its
not even cheesy. Its well directed and has a pretty good cast to it.
This is hands down, actually a LEGIT Chuck Norris movie. Not your
standard comedy act. Chuck acts very well here. Very likable with (lol
im not kidding) some depth. All in all i loved it. LOL even the ending
song which sounds like it could be in a sylvester stallone 80's
movie(Cobra, First Blood,lol Over the Top). So what im saying, is check
it out. It'll surprise ya. Ide give a 7.5 outta ten. cant do that here
cause you cant go by .5.

Once Again, there are egg heads looking to find The green mile when U
watch steven segal or chuck norris. This is not that kind of movie.
BUT, If U want a nice action mystery movie with decent acting then this
is your movie. This is a Gem of a flick. Excellent for a guy who gets
home late and wants to watch a movie. Kids girls or boys having a sleep
over. Father - son/daughter type. I have a 9 year old girl who loves to
curl up on my chest watching this kind of movie. Its great, and thank U
Chuck and steven for giving us so many. Silent Rage was Awesome also. I
recommend it. Don't try to expect too much out of the different kinds
of films. Your supposed to have fun with this kind, or scared or
whatever.

WOW! I've heard many negative reviews of this film but holy cow is it a nail
biter! Chuck Norris is at his prime in this movie, a performance he was only
able to top in Delta Force One and Two. Billy Drago, as Doctor Highwater,
leads a solid supporting cast in making this movie a huge success. Every
time Chuck and Billy team up they create an explosion of action and emotion.
I've watched this movie several times and every time I come away with
something new I have learned about the characters or the plot itself. This
movie has an awful high babe factor as well. Bottom line: Drago and Norris
are an hit on screen!

Chuck Norris takes on a serial killer in this enjoyable action
thriller. Okay, it's no Silent Rage . . . . . . . but what is? Fans of
the mighty Chuck will find enough to enjoy as he launches his patented
flying kicks. Steve James is also on hand to look tough and praise our
hero, who is literally nicknamed hero at various times throughout
(hence the title).<br><br>HERO AND THE TERROR is probably one of the weaker Norris/Cannon
collaborations, but still it's worth a watch if you think of it as a
watered- down version of SILENT RAGE.. sounds like a good idea, which-
let's face it- is.<br><br>Not one of his most exciting films, but definitely one of his better
films, considering everything after this was going straight to video. A
solid opening and a killer ending make up for the fact that there's
very little action in this, as it tries to go for more of a
thriller/drama vibe, in which case it only half-succeeds.<br><br>Hero and the Terror' was a slight departure for the action star  one
that offered more psychological drama than punches and kicks. Still, I
actually like the movie enough to say it's worth a look, particularly
if you've never seen it or haven't seen it in a while.<br><br>Not much martial arts in this, but Check it out if you like some Good
Suspense in an action film.

OK, it's her turn to watch a movie she likes, yet being a man of action
you start to have panic attacks just thinking about movies like Xanadu

whats the word?? compromise.Well done-some good acting and you get to
see Jaws which is cool.You also get to see parts of the theater that
you don't usually get to see. I would really like to know just who

Cop Danny O'Brien (Chuck Norris) starts having nightmares about his
heroic arrest of serial killer Simon Moon (Jack O'Halloran) from three
years prior. This is bad news because it is messing up his relationship
with his pregnant psychiatrist girlfriend Kay (Brynn Thayer). Oh, and
it also sucks because Moon has escaped from prison and started killing
again while hiding out inside a recently remodeled movie theater in
downtown Los Angeles. <br><br>Norris only did a few films in his career that fell under the horror
category (this, SILENT RAGE, HELLBOUND); if SILENT RAGE was his take on
FRANKENSTEIN, then HERO AND THE TERROR is Chuck's PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.
Of course, I'm a sucker for any horror movie set in a theater, so I
still enjoyed this on a revisit even if it isn't very good. Moon has
all the personality of Andrew from HELL NIGHT (1981) and the same
""heavy on the corpses and candles"" home design sensibilities as Jason
circa Friday THE 13th PART 2 (1981). Novelist Michael Blodgett adapted
his own book for this along with co-writer Dennis Shryack, who has some
good horror credits with THE CAR (1977) and MURDER BY PHONE (1982). The
plot is pretty flimsy and the drama between Norris and his crazy
seeming fiancé is really rough. Their birthday dinner scene is really
odd to the point I was screaming for Norris to ditch this crazy chick.
Also, the idea that Norris is the only one who believes the killer is
in the theater after three mysterious deaths is laughable. Still, there
are some memorable bits including a final showdown that fulfills my
wildest theater setting fantasies. Co-starring Steve James as Norris'
partner and Ron O'Neal as The Mayor.

He is the son of Sadie Virginia (Arnett), a homemaker, and Delmar Lloyd Busey, a construction design manager. He has English, as well as Irish, Scottish, and German, ancestry. He graduated from Nathan Hale High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1962 and for a while was a professional musician. A talented drummer, he played in several bands, including those of country-and-western legends Leon Russell, Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson.Busey\'s first film appearance was as a biker in the low-budget Angels Hard as They Come (1971) and, over the next few years, he landed several film roles generally as a country hick/redneck or surly, rebellious types. His real breakthrough came in the dynamic film The Buddy Holly Story (1978), with Busey taking the lead role as Buddy Holly, in addition to playing guitar and singing all the vocals! His stellar performance scored him a Best Actor nomination and the attention of Hollywood taking overcasting agents. Next up, he joined fellow young actors William Katt and Jan-Michael Vincent as surfing buddies growing up together in the cult surf film Big Wednesday (1978), directed by John Milius. However, a string of appearances in somewhat mediocre films took him out of the spotlight for several years, until he played the brutal assassin Mr. Joshua trying to kill Los Angeles cops Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the runaway mega-hit Lethal Weapon (1987). Further strong roles followed, including alongside Danny Glover once again in Predator 2 (1990). He was back on the beaches, this time tracking bank robbers with FBI agent Keanu Reeves, in Point Break (1991) and nearly stole the show as a psychotic Navy officer in league with terrorists led by Tommy Lee Jones taking over the USS Missouri in the highly popular Under Siege (1992).The entertaining Busey has continued to remain busy in front of the cameras and has certainly developed a minor cult following among many film fans.

McGill first gained attention from his memorable portrayal of Naoh, the leader of the Caveman tribe in La guerre du feu (1981). He also played the Fremen leader Stilgar in David Lynch\'s science fiction epic Dune (1984). With his rugged physique, cold, sinister stare and husky, whispering voice, McGill became usually memorable and well cast in villainous roles, such as the double-crossing FBI Agent Edward Killifer in Licence to Kill (1989) and as Penn, the terrorist leader in Under Siege 2: Dark Territory (1995).- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Michael Chrush <michaelj@chr.bar.com>          Trade Mark (3)        Rugged, muscular physique        Cold sinister staring eyes        Husky whispering voiceTrivia (5)      Trained to be an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London.

Michael Straczynski intended to cast McGill in the role of Major Ryan in the Babylon 5 (1994) episode ""Severed Dreams"". However, Straczynski didn\'t know his full name, so when he asked to have McGill contacted to set up a meeting about casting him, his assistant asked if he meant Bruce, and Straczynski said yes. Bruce McGill was invited to meet with Straczynski, and it was only after the two met that Straczynski realized his mistake. Straczynski decided to use Bruce for the role of Major Ryan, despite this.      Like the other cast members of David Lynch\'s Dune (1984), McGill, who played Stilgar, was under contract to appear in sequels should the first film be a success.

He starred in eight movies with Corey Feldman: The Lost Boys (1987), License to Drive (1988), Dream a Little Dream (1989), Blown Away (1993), Last Resort (1994), Dream a Little Dream 2 (1995), Busted (1997) and Lost Boys: The Tribe (2008).      He and Corey Feldman were known as the Two Coreys at the peak of their careers in the 1980s.      Formerly engaged to actress Tiffany Shepis. [Oct. 30, 2008].      Was buried at Thornhill memorial chapel in Toronto on March 16th, 2010. Because Haim was broke at the time of his death, a celebrity memorabilia site that he sometimes sold items to, Startifacts, had donated $20,000 to cover the cost of the transportation and headstone. The check was subsequently canceled when it was found the funeral home was covering the cost already.      Best friend Corey Feldman chose not to attend Haim\'s funeral at the request of Haim\'s family, because they wanted to keep the funeral as low-key as possible. Feldman instead issued an open letter on the Internet which he wrote to his deceased friend.      Back when he was a kid in Thornhill Ontario, Corey Haim used to break dance with the other kids at recess, in school.      Was offered the role of Charlie Fox in The Mosquito Coast (1986) and Chris Chambers in Stand by Me (1986). His father, who was acting as his manager at the time, turned down both in favor of Corey having a starring role in Lucas (1986). Both of those roles eventually went to the late River Phoenix.      Haim was engaged to model Cindy Guyer in 2000. He proposed to Guyer two days after they met at a Chicago autograph show.      He was in a relationship with actress Alyssa Milano from 1987 to 1990.      Was in a relationship with Victoria Beckham in 1995, which ended on mutual terms.Personal Quotes (6)      I was working on The Lost Boys (1987) when I smoked my first joint. But a year before that, I was starting to drink beer on the set of the film Lucas (1986). I lived in Los Angeles in the \'80s, which was not the best place to be. I did cocaine for about a year and a half, then it led to crack. I started on the downers which were a hell of a lot better than the uppers because I was a nervous wreck. But one led to two, two led to four, four led to eight, until at the end it was about 85 a day - the doctors could not believe I was taking that much. And that was just the valium - I\'m not talking about the other pills I went through.      I want to be the guy they talk about when they talk about comebacks. I want people to learn from me, see I\'m human, and understand that I make mistakes just like they do, but it doesn\'t have to consume you. You\'ve got to walk through the raindrops, and that\'s totally what I am trying to do.      This is where you make new friends and you start living and learning. So I\'m a late bloomer, I\'m 36, but hey, I\'m learning. Every day\'s a learning experience, right?

Every day I opened up, like, a can of sardines. It\'s something I\'ve addressed. Psychiatrists can be helpful. They have the medications and blah-blah-blah. But I don\'t want any of that, man. I\'ve dealt with this, and I\'m dealing with this-second by second, minute by minute, day by day. Everything\'s cool. It\'s just like, It happened, it\'s over, and move on.

My parents lived, breathed, ate and slept theatre. Emotions were right on the surface. Growing up, the unreal had as much importance as the real. - MF, 2005 interview      I do experience more scrutiny because of [Anne of Green Gables], but I have come to the conclusion, for my own sanity, that I can only choose things according to my own barometer of what I\'m trying to achieve or how I\'m stretching and reaching. That\'s all I really have in my control. - MF, 2005 interview      [on the title role in \'Anne of Green Gables\'] It was not an easy character. She\'s iconic, so people think they know what she is, but she was multifaceted. She was not the appendage of a male character; she was number one. She had a lot of character defects that were fantastic to play. She had an uncontrollable temper; she was a compulsive talker; she had a rich fantasy life - all of which were products of the fact she was an orphan and raised in undesirable circumstances. And it is her intellect, her wit which turns that around and turns the community around. I think that is why that is why that story has had lasting power.      [remembering her ""Anne Of Green Gables"" co-star and friend Jonathan Crombie] Truly I just remember at times just laughing so hard that you\'d just be crying. He was so playful and silly and as I said really bright, so his humor was always informed with that, which made him even funnier. He had that beautiful face. He was a lot of fun, he was very open so you just felt he was someone who really wanted to play and it really was a new experience for him. We were all just in it to do the best that we could and we had a lot of fun.      I like to say Reign (2013) is the 24 (2001) of the pre-Renaissance. I think we\'re going to take a lot of liberties with history, as well as extend it over a longer period of time.      What I love is a good role. In the theatre, there is just a canon of extraordinary roles, the quality of character is amazing, but I also love working in front of a camera. It was the first one for me; as a kid I was in front of a camera. I feel at home.      My parents lived, breathed, ate and slept theatre. Emotions were right on the surface. Growing up, the unreal had as much importance as the real.      I did a short film at Outfest, \'Where Are the Dolls,\' based on an Elizabeth Bishop poem done, where I play this woman who is sort of walking the streets and ends up alone dancing in a club. I have this hot and heavy scene with a very beautiful actress. It became very popular.      There are some fantastic roles for women and women of a certain age on television, whether it\'s \'Medium\' or \'The Closer\' or Damages (2007) or \'Saving Grace.\'      That whole thing: the paparazzi, a gazillion magazines. You can\'t lie on a beach. God forbid your bikini rides up too far or you\'ve eaten too many doughnuts and they catch you wiping your mouth. That must be exhausting, that lack of privacy.      My parents were working performers, so obviously I saw that there wasn\'t a lot of fairy tale going on there. It was a precarious world. One that they were deeply committed to and deeply loved, but one that required a lot of hard work.      I have two children myself. I always laugh; they have you playing mothers pretty early, us women.

Although there are many reasons why this film is a far cry from excellence,
Silver Bullet is, at the very least, very entertaining.  The film chronicles
how a werewolf has been killing off various people in a small town.  A young
boy in a wheelchair discovers who the werewolf is, and then must prepare
with his sister and crazy, dead-beat uncle to meet the wolfman when the moon
is full on a Halloween evening.  The film's plot really tests your
suspension of disbelief, but the characters, the acting, and the direction
are all done in a very likable style with a generous dose of humour.  Corey
Haim plays the youth very nicely, as he rides up and down the streets in a
souped-up wheelchair(?).  Gary Busey gives a fine performance as his uncle. 
The killings are fairly brutal, and the special effects are not too bad. 
The film is a lot of fun, and even though you will know who is the wolfman
long before you should know....the film zips along with an energetic,
entertaining pace.

I'm not sure why, but it seems like the rating for Silver Bullet is
somewhat low on IMDb in my opinion. Silver Bullet is a great horror
movie by the master of scares Stephen King. I did read his novella
""Cycle of the werewolf"" which was OK, not my favorite book but had a
very great idea. Silver Bullet took the idea and made it into a really
terrifying story that was also a great update to the werewolf monster
story. It made you think that what if there was someone in your town
who was hiding a secret that they were a monster who could judge you
and feel the need to just kill at their own will, and what if they knew
that you knew what they were? It makes it a whole lot worse. Silver
Bullet is a great movie to watch in the dark that I'm sure will give
you goosebumps and make the hair on your arms stand up.<br><br>The good residents of Tarker's Mill are dense enough to ignore or
explain away a series of violent deaths until a little boy is torn to
pieces while flying his kite after dark. At that point, the men gang up
and go into the fog-shrouded woods to hunt down whatever slasher is out
there. The most they achieve is the sighting of one hairy arm and a few
more sacrificial victims. But life goes on, and when the summer
fireworks show is canceled because people have deduced it might be
fatal to stay out after dark, the family's wheelchair-bound son Marty
goes coasting off to the bridge to shoot his own fireworks. Needless to
say, the hairy killer beast that is certain to be lurking there gets
shot in the eyeball by one of Marty's rockets and is now an unhappy
hairy killer beast.<br><br>The acting is decent enough, we have a baby Corey Haim who delivers a
very strong performance as Marty. It's sad to think that with the
success he had with Lucas, Silver Bullet and The Lost boys that he led
the life he did, he could have been something great when you watch this
performance. His relationship with Megan Follows who plays Jane his
sister was so touching and very believable. We also have a young Gary
Busey with those same teeth, lol, but he pulls in a decent performance
as well playing the alcoholic uncle who is cool in his nephew's eyes
but always lets everyone down. He's sick of doing that so really pulls
through for his niece and nephew when they need him most. Everett
McGill as the reverend/werewolf was chilling, you felt a certain
sympathy for him at one point as you know he feels some guilt but then
he turns very cocky trying to justify his killings and you hate him. He
was a great choice for this despicable villain. I love Silver Bullet,
it may be dated and the effects are not the greatest, but I think it's
a great horror movie that still gives me chills.<br><br>7/10

I was about to turn off the TV as opening titles rolled for Silver Bullet
and I saw the ""Cycle of the Werewolf"" reference, as I really don't care much
for fantasy monsters at all. This being a Stephen King, though, I thought
I'd give it a look. I'm glad I did.<br><br>The difference between this and the standard, cookie-cutter, grade-B
monster/werewolf/e-mail-spammer horror flick could be a tutorial for
playwrights, screenwriters and cinematographers. Instead of the tired
horror-flick plot - monster terrorizes small town after killing some folks
(usually with heavy-handed special-effects gore, repeated frequently
throughout); populace panics and does a lot of stupid things; standard-issue
hero arrives; standard-issue sexy young heroine falls in love with him and
the movie ends with the standard-issue hero dispatching the monster moments
before monster is about to make standard-issue heroine his/her/its next
victim - this one deftly draws on strong theatrical principles and
creativity to make the viewing real entertainment.<br><br>The young protagonist, who could be a paraplegic edition of ELL-LEE-YUHHT
from E.T., his mid-teenage sister, which character, as an adult, opens the
story with off-camera narrative (by Tovah Feldshuh), and an equally-charming
third kid, who happens to be the boy's uncle and is chronologically but in
no other respect an adult, endearingly played by Gary Busey, are developed
skilfully as characters in their own right, entirely apart from the werewolf
theme. By making us know and care about them, as well as the lesser
characters, King creates a warm and personal relationship between them and
the audience, something rarely achieved in standard horror/suspense fare.
Busey is just right as the uncle who finds responsibility to be rather an
impediment to enjoying life.<br><br>Injecting just the right touch of comedy where you'd least expect it and
making it work - to avoid spoiling, I'll just say something about the woods
at night and a bunch of people who don't belong there - a few red herrings
to keep you guessing, and one broad clue to the identity of the werewolf
that the sharp-eyed and -eared might catch but is otherwise not at all
tipping a hand, all combine to hold the interest and attention of the
viewer. The knitting-together of various threads - the significance of the
monster's attack on the suicidal woman, for one - creates a certain
intricacy that typical monster-flick shows rarely have.<br><br>Some blood and gore is unavoidable in a story like this; but again, it's
handled with skill and delicacy instead of blunt force. The attack scenes
are crafted to use the viewer's imagination much more than the
special-effects department to create the impression. Watch carefully and
you'll notice that the illusion is created by alternating very brief flashes
of action streaking by the lens, almost too fast to discern, with
establishing shots of the victim's accumulating injuries, with the audio
gluing it all together. A few frames of the monster's snout or eyes moving
past, a claw (or later on, a club or baseball bat) streaking by, but not not
visibly headed for any particular target, horrified looks and increasing
amounts of blood from the victim who may get tossed across the room or
otherwise propelled violently but you never see the propelling directly, and
your imagination does the rest.<br><br>It's not the masterpiece of the ages; but it's a film to enjoy once, and
then, if you're into the theatrical arts at all, see again - for
study.

Though based on a Stephen King novel, this movie is just as good as the
book. The characters in the movie was well played, the suspense was
just right, and the results were touching. Corey Haim playing the
wheel-chair bound brother was just amazing. Knowing he really loves his
sister was easy for him, but his sister was really the one who need to
grow up. His friend who put the snake in the tree, wasn't really a bad
kid, he just needed to be taught a little lesson. Just not being torn
to shreds by a lycanthrope(Werewolf). The three characters Red(Gary
Busey), Jane(Megan Follows), and Marty(Haim) proved themselves to be
the heroes, and the love bond had strengthened everyone, including the
sister. Stephen King has received a lot of credit for making this
movie, and I think it wasn't too bad at all.

I first saw this movie when I was ten years old, my uncle, a horror fanatic,
showed this to me and my brother and it scared the living soul out of
me.<br><br>Ten years later it still remains as one of my favorite horror films of all
time and I consider it one of the best of King's work.<br><br>When a small town is being ravaged by horrible mutilations, townsfolks begin
to think it may be a monster doing the killings. A small crippled boy comes
in contact with the werewolf and confides in his older sister and uncle and
they all set out on a search for the monster. What they discover will be
shocking.<br><br>The film is very well directed and relies a lot on tension and atmosphere
and solely on the acting which is performed well by Corey Haim, Megan
Follows and Garey Busey who is immensely likable and memorable as the
uncle.<br><br>The film itself as a horror movie is excellent with a lot of sheer tension
and some great horror scenes in which we never see the werewolf until the
end. That's an aspect that makes this film truly horrifying and the murders
are gruesome and never pulls its punches. The mysterious identity of the
werewolf is shocking and it leaves us on pins and needles until the exciting
end of the film.<br><br>I highly suggest this among horror fans and think it's worth a

In the spring of 1976, in the former peaceful town Tarker's Mills, the
inhabitants are scared with violent murders and press Sheriff Joe
Haller (Terry O'Quinn) to investigate further and find the responsible.
Meanwhile, the crippled boy Marty (Corey Haim) is very happy with the
new motorized wheelchair that his dear Uncle Red (Gary Busey) gave to
him. During the night, Marty sneaks out to use the fireworks Red gave
to him in a bridge. However he is attacked by a haired creature but
Marty shots a rocket in the left eye of the attacker and escapes. Marty
tells his sister Jane (Megan Follows) that he was attacked by a
werewolf and convinces her to seek out who in town could have an
injured eye. Jane discovers that the local Reverend Lowe (Everett
McGill) is the creature but now the siblings have to convince Uncle Red
to help them to disclose the truth about the reverend.<br><br>In the 80's, ""Silver Bullet"" was a successful werewolf film on VHS in
the rentals. I might have watched this entertaining movie at least
twice in those years. Today I have just seen it again and I really
liked it, specially the chance to see Corey Haim two years before ""Lost
Boys"" and Terry O'Quinn decades before ""Lost"". But maybe the most
important is the excellent transformation of the werewolf without the
use of computers. My vote is seven.<br><br>Title (Brazil): ""A Hora do Lobisomem"" (""The Hour of the Werewolf"")

Silver Bullet is my favorite of Steven King's horror adaptations (yes,
I do like this better than The Shining) . King even penned the
screenplay himself (from his short story 'The Cycle of the Werewolf'),
but since he was also responsible for the awful Maximum Overdrive,
that's no solid proof of quality. But it a damn cool movie.<br><br>What makes it so different and unique is that it's horror movie told
from a child's perspective (though I admit that the retrospective
narration seems out of place) and has a brother/sister dynamic that's
quite cute and makes you really care for the characters.<br><br>Corey Haim plays Marty Coslaw, a young boy who is confined to a
wheelchair for reasons unknown. His older sister Jane is forced to take
care of him and throws tantrums whenever the mum and dad take Marty's
side (which is always). But the chair doesn't stop Marty from being
mischievous. Especially when his manic, reckless Uncle Red (a fat Gary
Busey-absolutely brilliant, as always) builds him a motorized
wheelchair/bike called the Silver Bullet.<br><br>There is killer in their small town who strikes every month when the
moon is full. The townsfolk gradually become more and more weary as
autumn rolls on and Marty takes a personal offence when his best friend
is murdered, his best girl is run out of town and a fireworks display
is cancelled. Then he witnesses what the killer really is. But who is
going to believe a kid's story of a werewolf? Despite the red-herrings,
it's easy to figure out who it is before the main revelation. But it's
still a fun mystery.<br><br>Filmed with the little-used JDC-Scope process, Silver Bullet has
brilliant cinematography by Armando Nannuzzi and a wonderful score by
Jay Chattaway. There's not much horror to it, but I don't think it was
ever the intention to dwell on the violence. Even though I would call
this film suitable for kids (despite the 18/R-rating) it's still way
better than the PG-13 junk we get these days.<br><br>The film is also notable for Everett McGill (so evil as the baddie in
Under Siege 2), an under-rated and under-used actor in a typically
eccentric role as a charismatic Reverend. Doesn't he look like a cross
between Christopher Reeve and David Hasselhoff? <br><br>A perfect Halloween movie or any night with the curtains drawn and
lights off.

Playing like an after school werewolf special, Silver Bullet is a more
than tolerable King adaptation. It does lack in the effects department
and maybe some of the acting is phased by some over the top melodrama
but something about this movie is charming. That something is The Buse,
oh yeah your favorite big screen nut-job Gary Busey steals this one
entirely playing the caring, wise cracking, souped up wheel chair
building and oft skunk drunk Uncle Red. He's the comic relief, the
voice of reason and the unwilling hero all in one. This guy should make
a point to do more horror in the immediate future. It works for him
because the guys a fright show in his own right. He could easily become
the next Tom Atkins. Now if your'e asking yourself who Tom Atkins is
take a look at the Fog or Night of the Creeps and you'll immediately
find yourself saying, ""oohhh that guy? Yeah he's cool as *BEEP*!""
Silver Bullet is worth the watch for scary Gary's performance alone but
other highlights include, white trash wrestling fan yelling at TV set
""ooh that hurts ma'parts"",car vS. wheel chair high speed chase, genre
vet George ""Buck"" Flower having his block knocked off in the first
reel, the ole'$1.47 rocket in the werewolf eye trick, and everybody's
favorite stepfather Terry O'Quinn as the wimpiest sheriff in cinema. My
biggest knock against this movie other then the rather cheese-tastic
werewolf (guy in a bear suit) is that it's the second horror movie I've
seen were the cast reknown Hollywood madman Lawrence Tierney and
totally waste him. They should of had him go head to head with the
werewolf. He would have neutered that son of a sheepdog.

Although there are many reasons why this film is a far cry from excellence,
Silver Bullet is, at the very least, very entertaining.  The film chronicles
how a werewolf has been killing off various people in a small town.  A young
boy in a wheelchair discovers who the werewolf is, and then must prepare
with his sister and crazy, dead-beat uncle to meet the wolfman when the moon
is full on a Halloween evening.  The film's plot really tests your
suspension of disbelief, but the characters, the acting, and the direction
are all done in a very likable style with a generous dose of humour.  Corey
Haim plays the youth very nicely, as he rides up and down the streets in a
souped-up wheelchair(?).  Gary Busey gives a fine performance as his uncle. 
The killings are fairly brutal, and the special effects are not too bad. 
The film is a lot of fun, and even though you will know who is the wolfman
long before you should know....the film zips along with an energetic,
entertaining pace.

I'm not sure why, but it seems like the rating for Silver Bullet is
somewhat low on IMDb in my opinion. Silver Bullet is a great horror
movie by the master of scares Stephen King. I did read his novella
""Cycle of the werewolf"" which was OK, not my favorite book but had a
very great idea. Silver Bullet took the idea and made it into a really
terrifying story that was also a great update to the werewolf monster
story. It made you think that what if there was someone in your town
who was hiding a secret that they were a monster who could judge you
and feel the need to just kill at their own will, and what if they knew
that you knew what they were? It makes it a whole lot worse. Silver
Bullet is a great movie to watch in the dark that I'm sure will give
you goosebumps and make the hair on your arms stand up.<br><br>The good residents of Tarker's Mill are dense enough to ignore or
explain away a series of violent deaths until a little boy is torn to
pieces while flying his kite after dark. At that point, the men gang up
and go into the fog-shrouded woods to hunt down whatever slasher is out
there. The most they achieve is the sighting of one hairy arm and a few
more sacrificial victims. But life goes on, and when the summer
fireworks show is canceled because people have deduced it might be
fatal to stay out after dark, the family's wheelchair-bound son Marty
goes coasting off to the bridge to shoot his own fireworks. Needless to
say, the hairy killer beast that is certain to be lurking there gets
shot in the eyeball by one of Marty's rockets and is now an unhappy
hairy killer beast.<br><br>The acting is decent enough, we have a baby Corey Haim who delivers a
very strong performance as Marty. It's sad to think that with the
success he had with Lucas, Silver Bullet and The Lost boys that he led
the life he did, he could have been something great when you watch this
performance. His relationship with Megan Follows who plays Jane his
sister was so touching and very believable. We also have a young Gary
Busey with those same teeth, lol, but he pulls in a decent performance
as well playing the alcoholic uncle who is cool in his nephew's eyes
but always lets everyone down. He's sick of doing that so really pulls
through for his niece and nephew when they need him most. Everett
McGill as the reverend/werewolf was chilling, you felt a certain
sympathy for him at one point as you know he feels some guilt but then
he turns very cocky trying to justify his killings and you hate him. He
was a great choice for this despicable villain. I love Silver Bullet,
it may be dated and the effects are not the greatest, but I think it's
a great horror movie that still gives me chills.<br><br>7/10

I was about to turn off the TV as opening titles rolled for Silver Bullet
and I saw the ""Cycle of the Werewolf"" reference, as I really don't care much
for fantasy monsters at all. This being a Stephen King, though, I thought
I'd give it a look. I'm glad I did.<br><br>The difference between this and the standard, cookie-cutter, grade-B
monster/werewolf/e-mail-spammer horror flick could be a tutorial for
playwrights, screenwriters and cinematographers. Instead of the tired
horror-flick plot - monster terrorizes small town after killing some folks
(usually with heavy-handed special-effects gore, repeated frequently
throughout); populace panics and does a lot of stupid things; standard-issue
hero arrives; standard-issue sexy young heroine falls in love with him and
the movie ends with the standard-issue hero dispatching the monster moments
before monster is about to make standard-issue heroine his/her/its next
victim - this one deftly draws on strong theatrical principles and
creativity to make the viewing real entertainment.<br><br>The young protagonist, who could be a paraplegic edition of ELL-LEE-YUHHT
from E.T., his mid-teenage sister, which character, as an adult, opens the
story with off-camera narrative (by Tovah Feldshuh), and an equally-charming
third kid, who happens to be the boy's uncle and is chronologically but in
no other respect an adult, endearingly played by Gary Busey, are developed
skilfully as characters in their own right, entirely apart from the werewolf
theme. By making us know and care about them, as well as the lesser
characters, King creates a warm and personal relationship between them and
the audience, something rarely achieved in standard horror/suspense fare.
Busey is just right as the uncle who finds responsibility to be rather an
impediment to enjoying life.<br><br>Injecting just the right touch of comedy where you'd least expect it and
making it work - to avoid spoiling, I'll just say something about the woods
at night and a bunch of people who don't belong there - a few red herrings
to keep you guessing, and one broad clue to the identity of the werewolf
that the sharp-eyed and -eared might catch but is otherwise not at all
tipping a hand, all combine to hold the interest and attention of the
viewer. The knitting-together of various threads - the significance of the
monster's attack on the suicidal woman, for one - creates a certain
intricacy that typical monster-flick shows rarely have.<br><br>Some blood and gore is unavoidable in a story like this; but again, it's
handled with skill and delicacy instead of blunt force. The attack scenes
are crafted to use the viewer's imagination much more than the
special-effects department to create the impression. Watch carefully and
you'll notice that the illusion is created by alternating very brief flashes
of action streaking by the lens, almost too fast to discern, with
establishing shots of the victim's accumulating injuries, with the audio
gluing it all together. A few frames of the monster's snout or eyes moving
past, a claw (or later on, a club or baseball bat) streaking by, but not not
visibly headed for any particular target, horrified looks and increasing
amounts of blood from the victim who may get tossed across the room or
otherwise propelled violently but you never see the propelling directly, and
your imagination does the rest.<br><br>It's not the masterpiece of the ages; but it's a film to enjoy once, and
then, if you're into the theatrical arts at all, see again - for
study.

Though based on a Stephen King novel, this movie is just as good as the
book. The characters in the movie was well played, the suspense was
just right, and the results were touching. Corey Haim playing the
wheel-chair bound brother was just amazing. Knowing he really loves his
sister was easy for him, but his sister was really the one who need to
grow up. His friend who put the snake in the tree, wasn't really a bad
kid, he just needed to be taught a little lesson. Just not being torn
to shreds by a lycanthrope(Werewolf). The three characters Red(Gary
Busey), Jane(Megan Follows), and Marty(Haim) proved themselves to be
the heroes, and the love bond had strengthened everyone, including the
sister. Stephen King has received a lot of credit for making this
movie, and I think it wasn't too bad at all.

I first saw this movie when I was ten years old, my uncle, a horror fanatic,
showed this to me and my brother and it scared the living soul out of
me.<br><br>Ten years later it still remains as one of my favorite horror films of all
time and I consider it one of the best of King's work.<br><br>When a small town is being ravaged by horrible mutilations, townsfolks begin
to think it may be a monster doing the killings. A small crippled boy comes
in contact with the werewolf and confides in his older sister and uncle and
they all set out on a search for the monster. What they discover will be
shocking.<br><br>The film is very well directed and relies a lot on tension and atmosphere
and solely on the acting which is performed well by Corey Haim, Megan
Follows and Garey Busey who is immensely likable and memorable as the
uncle.<br><br>The film itself as a horror movie is excellent with a lot of sheer tension
and some great horror scenes in which we never see the werewolf until the
end. That's an aspect that makes this film truly horrifying and the murders
are gruesome and never pulls its punches. The mysterious identity of the
werewolf is shocking and it leaves us on pins and needles until the exciting
end of the film.<br><br>I highly suggest this among horror fans and think it's worth a
look.<br><br>***half out of **** stars.

In the spring of 1976, in the former peaceful town Tarker's Mills, the
inhabitants are scared with violent murders and press Sheriff Joe
Haller (Terry O'Quinn) to investigate further and find the responsible.
Meanwhile, the crippled boy Marty (Corey Haim) is very happy with the
new motorized wheelchair that his dear Uncle Red (Gary Busey) gave to
him. During the night, Marty sneaks out to use the fireworks Red gave
to him in a bridge. However he is attacked by a haired creature but
Marty shots a rocket in the left eye of the attacker and escapes. Marty
tells his sister Jane (Megan Follows) that he was attacked by a
werewolf and convinces her to seek out who in town could have an
injured eye. Jane discovers that the local Reverend Lowe (Everett
McGill) is the creature but now the siblings have to convince Uncle Red
to help them to disclose the truth about the reverend.<br><br>In the 80's, ""Silver Bullet"" was a successful werewolf film on VHS in
the rentals. I might have watched this entertaining movie at least
twice in those years. Today I have just seen it again and I really
liked it, specially the chance to see Corey Haim two years before ""Lost
Boys"" and Terry O'Quinn decades before ""Lost"". But maybe the most
important is the excellent transformation of the werewolf without the
use of computers. My vote is seven.<br><br>Title (Brazil): ""A Hora do Lobisomem"" (""The Hour of the Werewolf"")

Silver Bullet is my favorite of Steven King's horror adaptations (yes,
I do like this better than The Shining) . King even penned the
screenplay himself (from his short story 'The Cycle of the Werewolf'),
but since he was also responsible for the awful Maximum Overdrive,
that's no solid proof of quality. But it a damn cool movie.<br><br>What makes it so different and unique is that it's horror movie told
from a child's perspective (though I admit that the retrospective
narration seems out of place) and has a brother/sister dynamic that's
quite cute and makes you really care for the characters.<br><br>Corey Haim plays Marty Coslaw, a young boy who is confined to a
wheelchair for reasons unknown. His older sister Jane is forced to take
care of him and throws tantrums whenever the mum and dad take Marty's
side (which is always). But the chair doesn't stop Marty from being
mischievous. Especially when his manic, reckless Uncle Red (a fat Gary
Busey-absolutely brilliant, as always) builds him a motorized
wheelchair/bike called the Silver Bullet.<br><br>There is killer in their small town who strikes every month when the
moon is full. The townsfolk gradually become more and more weary as
autumn rolls on and Marty takes a personal offence when his best friend
is murdered, his best girl is run out of town and a fireworks display
is cancelled. Then he witnesses what the killer really is. But who is
going to believe a kid's story of a werewolf? Despite the red-herrings,
it's easy to figure out who it is before the main revelation. But it's
still a fun mystery.<br><br>Filmed with the little-used JDC-Scope process, Silver Bullet has
brilliant cinematography by Armando Nannuzzi and a wonderful score by
Jay Chattaway. There's not much horror to it, but I don't think it was
ever the intention to dwell on the violence. Even though I would call
this film suitable for kids (despite the 18/R-rating) it's still way
better than the PG-13 junk we get these days.<br><br>The film is also notable for Everett McGill (so evil as the baddie in
Under Siege 2), an under-rated and under-used actor in a typically
eccentric role as a charismatic Reverend. Doesn't he look like a cross
between Christopher Reeve and David Hasselhoff? <br><br>A perfect Halloween movie or any night with the curtains drawn and
lights off.

But she was known to millions of other fans for her movie career, which spanned the period from 1927 until 1964, after which she appeared on television until 1986. It was a career that lasted for 59 years.Barbara Stanwyck was born Ruby Catherine Stevens on July 16, 1907, in Brooklyn, New York, to working class parents Catherine Ann (McPhee) and Byron E. Stevens. Her father, from Massachusetts, had English ancestry, and her Canadian mother, from Nova Scotia, was of Scottish and Irish descent. Stanwyck went to work at the local telephone company for fourteen dollars a week, but she had the urge (a dream--that was all it was) somehow to enter show business. When not working, she pounded the pavement in search of dancing jobs. The persistence paid off. Barbara was hired as a chorus girl for the princely sum of $40 a week, much better than the wages she was getting from the phone company. She was seventeen, and was going to make the most of the opportunity that had been given her.In 1928 Barbara moved to Hollywood, where she was to start one of the most lucrative careers filmdom had ever seen. She was an extremely versatile actress who could adapt to any role. Barbara was equally at home in all genres, from melodramas, such as Forbidden (1932) and Stella Dallas (1937), to thrillers, such as Double Indemnity (1944), one of her best films, also starring Fred MacMurray (as you have never seen him before). She also excelled in comedies such as Remember the Night (1940) and The Lady Eve (1941). Another genre she excelled in was westerns, Union Pacific (1939) being one of her first and TV\'s The Big Valley (1965) (her most memorable role) being her last. In 1983, she played in the ABC hit mini-series The Thorn Birds (1983), which did much to keep her in the eye of the public. She turned in an outstanding performance as Mary Carson.Barbara was considered a gem to work with for her serious but easygoing attitude on the set. She worked hard at being an actress, and she never allowed her star quality to go to her head. She was nominated for four Academy Awards, though she never won. She turned in magnificent performances for all the roles she was nominated for, but the ""powers that be"" always awarded the Oscar to someone else. However, in 1982 she was awarded an honorary Academy Award for ""superlative creativity and unique contribution to the art of screen acting.""

In 1978, at the The 50th Annual Academy Awards (1978), before starting the presentation of the sound award, Holden publicly thanked her for what she did.

[1999]      In February 1955 she was mentioned to be one of the female stars of Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957) but she never made the film.      As of the age of four, after her mother died and her father, upset by his wife\'s death, abandoned his kids, Barbara was brought up by her elder sister.      She was a staunch Republican and conservative.      Before she was an actress, she was a successful dancer and chorus girl.      She was very good friends with: Julie London, John Forsythe, Jane Wyman, Loretta Young, Jean Arthur, Bette Davis, Frank Capra, Fred MacMurray, Lucille Ball, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, Tony Martin, Richard Basehart, Aaron Spelling, Robert Fuller, James Drury, John McIntire, Denny Miller, Bruce Dern, Rhonda Fleming, Leif Erickson, Gavin MacLeod, Pernell Roberts, Jeanne Cooper, Richard Anderson, L.Q.

Forty of the movies she appeared in in her 35-year-long career were screened through the month of December 2013 in special tribute at New York City\'s Film Forum.      Stanwyck vehemently opposed the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. She felt that if someone from her disadvantaged background had risen to success, others should be able to do the same without government intervention or assistance.      A massive, 1000-page biography of Stanwyck, published in 2013 by Victoria Wilson, is merely the first volume of an ongoing narrative of the star, one that covers only the first 33 years of Stanwyck\'s life.      Was considered for the title role in Mildred Pierce (1945).      Born at 8:55 PM.      She was known to be a very private lady.      Although many would say that her greatest movie role was in Double Indemnity (1944), directed by Billy Wilder, she was an outspoken critic of Wilder\'s Kiss Me, Stupid (1964), calling it obscene (although she admitted to not having seen it). However, there seems to have been no lasting animosity between them - when Stanwyck received her AFI Life Achievement Award, Wilder was amongst the most laudatory of those paying tribute to her.      Upon her death, she was cremated and the ashes scattered from a helicopter over Lone Pine, California, where she had made some of her Western films.      Through his friend Oscar Levant, Frank Fay met and married Barbara Stanwyck, then a young chorus girl who\'d just gotten her first Broadway show (Burlesque, 1927) In 1929 they did a dramatic sketch, as ""Fay and Stanwyck"" at the Palace. Later that year, they were called to Hollywood, so Frank could star in the film ""Show of Shows."" Fay and Stanwyck\'s marriage and their experience in Hollywood later became the basis of a Hollywood movie - ""A Star is Born"".      In Hollywood, as everywhere he went, Frank Fay did not make a lot of friends. A standard joke of the time went ""who\'s got the biggest prick in Hollywood?"" Answer: ""Barbara Stanwyck."" The womanizing, alcoholic Fay\'s career floundered, while Stanwyck\'s flourished for decades. In 1935 the two were divorced, and Fay continued his downward spiral, until 1944, when he was chosen to play Elwood P. Dowd in the original New York City Broadway production of ""Harvey"".      Started smoking when she was nine.      Caught bronchitis while filming The Thorn Birds (1983).      In a first season episode of ""The BIg Valley"" (called ""Tunnel of Gold"") her character Victoria Barkley explains that she lost both of her parents as a young child, and was raised in a foster home. Years later, Stanwyck explained that was written that way because the exact same thing had happened to her as a child, losing both parents at a young age and growing up in foster care.Personal Quotes (19)      During Double Indemnity (1944), Fred MacMurray would go to rushes [viewings of daily completed shots]. I remember asking Fred, ""How was I?"" [Fred\'s response was] ""I don\'t know about you, but I was wonderful!"" Such a true remark. Actors only look at themselves.      I\'m a tough old broad from Brooklyn. I intend to go on acting until I\'m ninety and they won\'t need to paste my face with make-up.      [Referring to director Frank Capra] Eyes are the greatest tool in film. Mr. Capra taught me that. Sure, it\'s nice to say very good dialogue, if you can get it. But great movie acting - watch the eyes!      Put me in the last fifteen minutes of a picture and I don\'t care what happened before. I don\'t even care if I was IN the rest of the damned thing - I\'ll take it in those fifteen minutes.      My only problem is finding a way to play my fortieth fallen female in a different way from my thirty-ninth.      [In 1939 on the fact that her fiancé, Robert Taylor, was four years younger than she] The boy\'s got a lot to learn and I\'ve got a lot to teach.      It\'s perhaps not the future I would choose. I still think it\'s possible to make a success of both marriage and career, even though I didn\'t. But it\'s not a bad future. And I\'m not afraid of it.      I couldn\'t remember my name for weeks. I\'d be at the theater and hear them calling, ""Miss Stanwyck, Miss Stanwyck"", and I\'d think, ""Where is that dame? Why doesn\'t she answer? By crickie, it\'s me!""      Egotism - usually just a case of mistaken nonentity.      There\'s nothing more fun in the whole world than seeing a child open a present at Christmas. To have a six-year-old boy stroke a bicycle with his eyes and, not daring to touch, turn and ask, ""Is it mine, Missy? Really mine?"" That\'s part of my future. The rest is work. And, I hope, some wisdom.      Career is too pompous a word. It was a job and I have always felt privileged to be paid for doing what I love doing.      Attention embarrasses me. I don\'t like to be on display.      I want to go on until they have to shoot me.      [on filming Titanic (1953)] The night we were making the scene of the dying ship in the outdoor tank at Twentieth, it was bitter cold. I was 47 feet up in the air in a lifeboat swinging on the davits. The water below was agitated into a heavy rolling mass and it was thick with other lifeboats full of women and children. I looked down and thought, ""If one of these ropes snaps now, it\'s good-by for you"". Then I looked up at the faces lined along the rail -those left behind to die with the ship. I thought of the men and women who had been through this thing in our time. We were re-creating an actual tragedy and I burst into tears. I shook with great racking sobs and couldn\'t stop.      [In the 1960s, explaining her four-year absence from films after Forty Guns (1957)] Nobody asked me. They don\'t normally write parts for women my age because America is now a country of youth. We\'ve matured and moved on. The past belongs to the past.      Some kids are born with bad blood just like horses. When a parent has done everything possible, the only solution is to save yourself.      [on performing her favorite title role in Stella Dallas (1937)] The task was to convince audiences that Stella\'s instincts were fine and noble even though, on the surface she was loud, flamboyant, and a bit vulgar.      (On her character in Sorry, Wrong Number (1948) ""Almost from the word go, she is way up there emotionally, and stays there day after day...I decided I\'d prefer to jump in, bam, go, stay there, up, try to sustain it all the way and shoot the works.""      (On making Sorry, Wrong Number (1948) ""Five days I was handling it, starting the next day\'s work where I\'d picked up, sustaining it all, and then I had two whole days to relax and not to worry about the character, and I tell you it was strange.

All of his grandparents were immigrants from Northern Ireland. He was a tough street kid who took an early interest in gymnastics. He joined the circus as an acrobat and worked there until he was injured. It was in the Army during WW II that he was introduced to the USO and acting. His first film was The Killers (1946), and that made him a star. He was a self-taught actor who learned the business as he went along. He set up his own production company in 1948 with Harold Hecht and James Hill to direct his career. He played many different roles in pictures as varied as The Crimson Pirate (1952), From Here to Eternity (1953), Elmer Gantry (1960) and Atlantic City, USA (1980).His production company, Hecht-Hill-Lancaster, produced such films as Paddy Chayefsky\'s Marty (1955) (Oscar winner 1955) and The Catered Affair (1956). In the 1980s he appeared as a supporting player in a number of movies, such as Local Hero (1983) and Field of Dreams (1989). However, it will be the sound of his voice, the way that he laughed, and the larger-than-life characters he played that will always be remembered.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Tony Fontana <tony.fontana@spacebbs.com>          Spouse (3)               Susan Martin          (10 September\xa01991            - 20 October\xa01994)\xa0(his death)                         Norma Anderson          (28 December\xa01946            - 1969)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(5 children)                         June Ernst          (1935            - 1946)\xa0(divorced)          Trade Mark (5)        A killer smile, which he called ""The Grin""        A great physique, of which director John Frankenheimer said, ""Nobody ever looked like Burt Lancaster in The Crimson Pirate (1952) .""

[1995]      Graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in New York [1930]      Ranked #85 in Empire (UK) magazine\'s ""The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time"" list. [October 1997]      Started out as a circus performer.      Father of actor/writer Bill Lancaster.      Was a big fan of the silent film The Unknown (1927), probably partially because the movie took place in a circus, and Burt himself spent a lot of time early in his life in a circus. He once said that no scene in any movie affected him as emotionally as the one in this movie in which Lon Chaney learns that Joan Crawford does not love him.      Suffered a severe stroke while visiting actor Dana Andrews, who was suffering from Alzheimer\'s Disease. Lancaster remained hospitalized until February 1991, and incapacitated and unable to speak until his death in October, 1994. [November 1990]      Was Cecil B. DeMille\'s first choice to play ""Samson"" in Samson and Delilah (1949).      5 children: James Stephen ""Jimmy"" (born June 30, 1946), William ""Billy"" (born in November, 1947), Susan Elizabeth (born July 5, 1949), Joanna Mari (born in July, 1951) and Sighle (born in 1954).      Son Jimmy was diagnosed as schizophrenic.      According to Kate Buford in her biography ""Burt Lancaster: An American Life,"" he felt competitive with Marlon Brando, who achieved stardom playing Stanley Kowalski on Broadway, a role Lancaster turned down. A Top 10 box-office success in the early 1960s, it was this sense of competition with Brando, who was known as both an actor\'s actor and a major movie star, that led Lancaster to plunge into art films and riskier fare such as Luchino Visconti\'s Il gattopardo (1963), in order to prove himself as an actor and be known as an artist rather than just a movie star. After this refocusing of his career, he slipped out of the Top 10 and never again was a major box office attraction.      Descended from Irish Protestants from Ulster who emigrated to the United States in the 1880s.      Known for his liberal political sympathies, he was one of the Hollywood movie stars, along with Marlon Brando, Sammy Davis Jr., Charlton Heston, Judy Garland, Eartha Kitt, Harry Belafonte, Sidney Poitier and Paul Newman, who participated in Martin Luther King\'s March on Washington in August 1963. He flew home from Europe, where he was making a film, to participate. He was a financial supporter of King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.      In 1947 he was offered the role of Stanley Kowalski in the original Broadway production of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" after first choice John Garfield was rejected due to his demands for a ownership percentage of the play. He turned down the role that went to Marlon Brando and made him a legend.      He was voted the 39th Greatest Movie Star of all time by Entertainment Weekly.      One of his demands was that he have a high bar set up on sets and locations so he could perform acrobatics and stay in shape.      He admitted that an odd thing always happened to him on a movie set. He would complain about everything, sometimes very loudly. By the end of the shoot however, the crews loved him and hated to see him go, despite his complaints. He never understood why that happened.      He was an infamous ladies man in Hollywood, which eventually irritated his wife, Norma, enough for her to leave him.      Until undergoing emergency quadruple heart bypass surgery in 1983, he maintained the fantastic physical health he attained as an acrobat in his youth. He impressed many who knew him with his apparently enormous strength.      Felt intimidated by co-star Montgomery Clift on the set of From Here to Eternity (1953) due to Clift\'s great talent.      Despite his enduring stardom, he surprisingly only placed in Quigley Publications\' Top 10 Poll of Money-Making Stars twice: #4 in 1956 and #10 in 1963. The annual poll of movie exhibitors ranks the top stars in terms of box-office drawing power. Even more surprisingly, his friend and co-star Kirk Douglas never made the list during his career.Robert Altman wanted Lancaster for the role of Ned Buntline in Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull\'s History Lesson (1976) because he had the ""stature"" of a great movie star but was ""able to play that as a kind of bullshitter"", which was what Altman conceived the character to be: ""He understood totally the bullshit factor and what he was playing."" Buntline, a real-life writer of nickel Westerns, had invented Buffalo Bill Cody as a western hero; Altman knew that Lancaster had invented himself as a star, a new kind of star that had revolutionized the movies in the 1950s.      His son Bill Lancaster\'s screenplay for The Bad News Bears (1976) was based on his experience being coached by his father. Bill had been disabled by polio as a child, and according to friend Joel Douglas - the son of Kirk Douglas - the Tatum O\'Neal character in the film, the odd kid out, was Bill. The coach played by Walter Matthau was based on Burt, who was known for his grumpiness.      Came up with $150,000 of his own money to complete Go Tell the Spartans (1978) after the production ran out of money with five days left to shoot. The shooting schedule already had been pared from 40 to 31 days to save money.      After placing tenth place in the Motion Picture Herald poll of most popular box-office stars in 1962, he dropped to 18th place in 1963 and never again appeared on the list.      Allegedly showed up at a Hollywood Oscar party in the late 1950s wearing a G-string and spray-painted gold, resembling an Academy Award statuette after a similar stunt had been done by Rock Hudson and Vera-Ellen.      Was forced by United Artists to make four films for $150,000 a picture in the 1960s: The Young Savages (1961), Birdman of Alcatraz (1962), The Train (1964) and The Hallelujah Trail (1965) rather than his normal fee of $750,000, because of cost overruns at his production company, Hecht-Hill-Lancaster, for which he was personally responsible.      In January 1980, he almost died during a routine operation to remove his gallbladder, when the operation, which should have lasted five hours, turned into an 11-hour ordeal. After the organ was removed, a team of doctors worked to repair an unusually small channel from the gallbladder to the intestines, although Lancaster later told a friend that a doctor had accidentally cut into a valve. A doctor reportedly got down on the floor to pray for the actor\'s life. Lancaster was in intensive care for 48-hours after the operation.      He made a great deal of money from Airport (1970), which was a huge hit, due to a 10% profit participation once the movie hit $50 million. (the film grossed $45.3 million in North America alone). Lancaster said that the movie was ""the worst piece of junk ever made.""      Told Bruce Davison, his co-star in Ulzana\'s Raid (1972), of a practical joke he played on Kirk Douglas, who was several inches shorter than Lancaster: ""I\'ll never forget the time we were getting ready for our big two-shot and I hid his lifts on him. He was so pissed!""      His first TV role was a guest appearance on Sesame Street (1969) in 1969, reciting the alphabet.      A self-described atheist, Lancaster had turned down the role in the remake of Ben-Hur (1959) played by Charlton Heston, but followed in Heston\'s footsteps when he played the title role in Moses the Lawgiver (1974), the $5-million TV epic produced by Britain\'s ATV-ITC and Italy\'s RAI Television. When a reporter asked him if he was following in Heston\'s sandal-clad steps, Lancaster replied, ""If Charlton was trapped in Biblical films, it was his own fault - he accepted the limitation."" Though Lancaster claimed he was an atheist, some of his friends doubted him.      Turned down the lead in Patton (1970) due to his anti-Vietnam War sympathies, but actively campaigned for the title role in ""Patton"" screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola\'s next movie, The Godfather (1972). He offered to do a screen test for the role of Don Corleone, and even though Paramount brass was interested in casting him, Coppola wanted Marlon Brando, and got him after Brando made his own ""screen-test"" (actually a video Coppola shot of him improvising a makeup for the old Don). Both George C. Scott and Brando won, and refused, Oscars for the roles.      An unabashed political liberal, chairman of the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California and an active campaigner for George McGovern in the 1972 Presidential election, Lancaster was one of the 575 people named on President Richard Nixon\'s 1973 ""Enemies List,"" along with fellow actors Gene Hackman and Paul Newman, ""Playboy"" magazine publisher Hugh M. Hefner and TV producer Norman Lear.      Helped pay for the defense of Private Billy Dean Smith, an African American soldier accused of \'fragging\' two officers in Vietnam in 1971. Lancaster gave $3,000 to his defense attorneys to hire ballistics experts to testify at his court-martial. Smith was acquitted.      Was cast in Old Gringo (1989) but was informed by Columbia when he arrived in Mexico City for rehearsals in December 1987 that he was being replaced with Gregory Peck, as the insurance for him was too high. He sued Columbia for his $1.5-million fee, and made an out-of-court settlement.      Had tried to raise financing for four years for Hector Babenco\'s film of Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985), based on the novel by Manuel Puig, after Babenco gave him the novel in 1981 at the NY Film Critics Society Ceremony. Lancaster was to have played the role of Molina, the gay hairdresser who shares a cell with Valentin, a political prisoner. However, Lancaster had a heart attack in June 1983, and subsequently a quadruple-bypass operation, and at the age of 70, he was essentially uninsurable. He had to withdraw from roles in Maria\'s Lovers (1984), Gorky Park (1983), Firestarter (1984) and the TV mini-series A.D. (1985). The film was later made for less than $1 million with William Hurt in the role Lancaster wanted to play. Hurt won a Best Actor Oscar as Molina.      Turned down a $1-million offer to appear in the remake of Ben-Hur (1959). If he had accepted the offer, he would have beaten both Elizabeth Taylor (Cleopatra (1963)) as the first female star and Marlon Brando (The Fugitive Kind (1960)) as the first male star, to breach that million-dollar threshold.      In July 1965, United Artists made a settlement with Lancaster to end is association with his production company, Hecht-Hill-Lancaster, which had financially floundered in the late 1950s due to a few flops and exorbitant spending, and wound up operations in 1959. The payoff amount was $920,954.85, approximately $5,223,000 in 2003 dollars. In 1964, part of the proposed settlement with UA had been for Lancaster to star in Khartoum (1966) but that role eventually was played by Charlton Heston.      Was named the #19 greatest actor on the 50 Greatest Screen Legends by the American Film Institute      During World War II, he served as a member of the Special Services branch, entertaining troops. He was stationed in Italy for much of the war.      He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6801 Hollywood Blvd.      Suffered his first heart attack during the making of Cattle Annie and Little Britches (1981) in 1979.      He and Kirk Douglas acted together in 7 movies: Victory at Entebbe (1976), Tough Guys (1986), Seven Days in May (1964), The List of Adrian Messenger (1963), I Walk Alone (1947), Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957) and The Devil\'s Disciple (1959)      Lancaster lost out on two roles he lobbied for to Marlon Brando (roles that helped make Brando a legend): that of Stanley Kowalski in \'A Streetcar Named Desire\' (1951) and that of Don Vito Corleone in \'The Godfather\' (1972).      He was not close friends with Kirk Douglas as was often perceived. The closeness of their friendship was largely fabricated by the publicity-wise Douglas, while, in reality, they were very competitive with each other and sometimes privately expressed a mutual personal disdain despite a mutual respect for their acting talents.      One of the very few humanitarian causes he publicly associated himself with was AIDS research. In 1985 he read out a letter from Rock Hudson announcing he was dying of AIDS, although there was later some controversy as to whether the letter had been written by Rock or his secretary (in a 2010 Paley Center for Media documentary about gay visibility on TV, writer Bruce Vilanch said that he had written the letter at Hudson\'s request). This was at a Hollywood dinner to raise awareness, which only a very few stars such as Elizabeth Taylor and Burt Reynolds dared attend. In 1988 there was a poster of Lancaster holding a rose and a caption urging people to be careful.      Was considered for the role of Jason Colby in The Colbys (1985).Luchino Visconti wanted to cast Laurence Olivier in the title role of the Italian prince in ""The Leopard"" (1963), but his producer overruled him. The producer insisted on a box office star to justify the lavish production\'s high budget and essentially forced Visconti to accept Burt Lancaster. A decade later, the two Oscar-winning actors competed again for the role of another Italian prince, Mafia chieftain Don Corleone, in ""The Godfather"" (1972), ultimately losing out to Marlon Brando.      Shared a birthday with Luchino Visconti, who directed him in Il gattopardo (1963) and Gruppo di famiglia in un interno (1974).      Died the very same year as his long-time friend, circus acrobat partner and frequent co-star Nick Cravat.      His performance as J.J. Hunsecker in Sweet Smell of Success (1957) is ranked #76 on Premiere Magazine\'s 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006).      Frequently compared with the English actor Sir Dirk Bogarde. Both achieved stardom in purely commercial films, then deliberately broke away from their images to star in artistic films and in so doing lost their box office popularity. Both actors were directed twice to great effect by Luchino Visconti - Lancaster in Il gattopardo (1963) and Gruppo di famiglia in un interno (1974), Bogarde in La caduta degli dei (Götterdämmerung) (1969) and Morte a Venezia (1971).      Attended Visconti\'s funeral in Rome in March 1976.      His performance as J.J. Hunsecker in Sweet Smell of Success (1957) is ranked #61 on Premiere Magazine\'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.      Lancaster stood 6\' 1"" at his peak, as can be seen in Vera Cruz (1954) where he is clearly two inches shorter than his 6\' 3"" co-star Gary Cooper.      Was the original choice to play Sam Flusky in Under Capricorn (1949), but the part went to Joseph Cotten instead because Lancaster was deemed too expensive.      Gave two of his revolvers to Ringo Starr when The Beatles stayed in Hollywood in August 1964.      When Republican candidate George Bush referred to the American Civil Liberties Union as ""un-American"" during the 1988 presidential election, Lancaster responded by appearing in a television advertisement in which he said, ""My name is Burt Lancaster and I\'ve a confession to make. I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU."".      A lifelong Democrat and liberal activist, Lancaster appeared prominently on President Richard Nixon\'s ""List of Enemies"" due to his support for Senator George McGovern in the 1972 presidential election.      He was nearly blacklisted in the late 1940s due to his liberal political beliefs, and the FBI kept a file detailing his activities.      Campaigned for Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential election.Go Tell the Spartans (1978), though little seen at the time of its release, is widely considered the greatest anti-war movie about Vietnam.      Shortly before his massive stroke in November 1990 Lancaster had discussed starring in a sequel to Il gattopardo (1963). Some of his friends had told him he would be making a big mistake.      A self-described atheist, Lancaster agreed to play a corrupt evangelist in Elmer Gantry (1960) because he wanted to make an anti-Billy Graham statement. His performance won him the Best Actor Oscar.      He could not attend the funeral of close friend Telly Savalas as he was so ill.      Was a close, longtime friend of Telly Savalas.      Eagerly sought the role of a dying composer who discovers his homosexuality in Luchino Visconti\'s masterpiece Morte a Venezia (1971). Although the role went to Dirk Bogarde, Lancaster later played a reclusive professor who is brought face to face with his latent homosexuality in Visconti\'s Gruppo di famiglia in un interno (1974).      Signed a letter in 1947 deploring the anti-communist witch hunts in Hollywood.      Participated in the March on Washington for Civil Rights on 28 August 1963, along with Charlton Heston, Marlon Brando and Bob Dylan.      In 1987 he joined Gregory Peck, Martin Sheen and Lloyd Bridges in narrating a television advertisement by People for the American Way, a liberal action group founded by Norman Lear, in opposition to President Ronald Reagan\'s appointment of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court.      He would frequently turn down lifetime achievement awards during the 1980s, saying half-jokingly, ""Give them to my good friend Kirk"", since he knew Douglas would be happier in the limelight.      Claimed that he learned a great deal from Gary Cooper\'s laid back acting style and behavior on the set of Vera Cruz (1954).      On the set of Ulzana\'s Raid (1972) Lancaster told actor Bruce Davison that he had undergone so much plastic surgery over the years that at the age of 58 the most real thing about him were his eyes. He also advised Davison not to become too publicly involved in the anti-Vietnam movement until he was more established in Hollywood.      He was nearly 33 when he appeared in his first movie, The Killers (1946), having worked as a circus acrobat since his late teens and following war service and acting on Broadway.      Joined Gregory Peck, James Stewart, Liza Minnelli, and Orson Welles in testifying against the colorization of old movies by Ted Turner in the mid 1980s.      During the late 1950s John Wayne approached Lancaster, suggesting they make a western together. Lancaster laughed off the idea, suggesting they would need Kirk Douglas in the film as well. In reality, Lancaster would not work with Wayne, Hollywood\'s most prominent Republican supporter who had been actively involved in the McCarthy witch hunts as a founding member and later President of the right-wing Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals. Lancaster had only agreed to co-star opposite Gary Cooper, a moderate Republican who gave a vague testimony to the House Unamerican Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1947, after Cooper had starred in the anti-McCarthyism western High Noon (1952). Despite this, Lancaster joined a minute\'s silence for Wayne on 11 June 1979 while filming Cattle Annie and Little Britches (1981) after Wayne died in Los Angeles.      Supported Tom Bradley\'s unsuccessful campaign for Mayor of Los Angeles in 1969.      Replaced Sir Laurence Olivier as Dr Ernst Janning in Judgment at Nuremberg (1961). Lancaster had not been impressed when Olivier kept confusing him with Kirk Douglas while filming The Devil\'s Disciple (1959).Jane Fonda admitted she was devastated to lose Lancaster from Old Gringo (1989), because she admired him very greatly.      A self-described ""Kennedy man"", Lancaster dined with President John F. Kennedy at the White House. He delayed the release of Seven Days in May (1964) when the President was assassinated, and later joined fellow liberal activists Robert Ryan and Will Geer in starring in Executive Action (1973), the first Kennedy assassination conspiracy movie. Its ""real purpose"", Lancaster stated, was ""to make people skeptical."".      Attended Elizabeth Taylor\'s ""Commitment to Life"" fundraiser on 19 September 1985, despite being warned his appearance would resurrect the longtime rumors about his sexuality. At the event Lancaster read out Rock Hudson\'s letter admitting that he had AIDS.      He was prevented from playing William Hurt\'s Oscar-winning role as a flamboyant gay hairdresser in Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985) when forced to undergo quadruple bypass surgery on 26 August 1983 following a heart attack. He believed his vocal chords were damaged after tubes were inserted down his throat during the operation.      In 1961 he announced his intention to produce a biopic of Michelangelo, in which he would play the title role and possibly portray the painter as a homosexual. However, he was forced to shelve this project due to the five-month filming schedule on Il gattopardo (1963). Later, Charlton Heston starred as Michelangelo in The Agony and the Ecstasy (1965). Heston denied that the painter was gay in his autobiography.      In 1965 he turned down Charlton Heston\'s role as Major General Charles Gordon in Khartoum (1966), and Richard Burton\'s role in The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965).      Teamed up with director John Huston to make The Unforgiven (1960) as a left-wing response to John Ford\'s epic western The Searchers (1956).      Took a pay cut to make Castle Keep (1969), which he intended to be the ultimate anti-war film and an allegory for the Vietnam conflict.      Turned down Clint Eastwood\'s role as Harry Callahan in Dirty Harry (1971). The plot some called fascist of the lawman who goes beyond the limits of the law to kill a marginalized criminal contradicted his belief in a collective responsibility for criminal and social justice and the protection of individual rights.      Was ill with hepatitis while filming Cattle Annie and Little Britches (1981).      Voted ""Man of the Year"" by Aid for AIDS in 1987 for his extensive work on their behalf, including allowing his photograph to be used on their annual Christmas card.      He was originally cast in Victor Mature\'s role in The Robe (1953), but backed out due to the Christian theme.      Starred in five films directed by John Frankenheimer.      In 1957 he requested a meeting with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, who responded, ""I will not greet Lancaster in view of his subversive associations."".      In order to get his passport renewed in January 1954, he was forced to send a letter to the State Department in which he wrote, ""I am not now a Communist. I never been a Communist and I am not in sympathy with the Communist movement."".      He has only one grandchild, granddaughter Keigh, born in 1966 to his son, Bill Lancaster.      His son, Bill Lancaster, wrote the screenplay for The Bad News Bears (1976).      Daughter Sighle worked as a model then became a social worker.      His daughter Sighle\'s name is pronounced Sheila.      His son Jimmy was born with a foot deformity and as a baby had to wear a cast that had to be constantly changed. When daughter Joanna was born with the same deformity, they decided not to use a cast but to see if she would outgrow the deformity.      Son Billy was named after Lancaster\'s dead brother. His daughter Susan Elizabeth was named after his mother, Lizzie.      He has a step-son, John Scherer, from his widow, Susie.      One of his first acting roles, if not his first professional role, was a part in the non-musical Broadway play ""A Sound of Hunting"" (1945) playing character ""Sgt. Joseph Mooney"". He co-starred in his first movie the next year (The Killers (1946)).      His house burned down (as did many others) in the famous Bel Air - Brentwood fire of November 6, 1961.      Irish-American.      Ironically, he was not a very good swimmer despite being an extremely versatile athlete from his days as a circus acrobat, and had to train with a professional swimming coach for his role in The Swimmer (1968), a role he took after asking his daughter Joanna what she thought of the script.      According to his wishes, he was buried without any memorial or funeral service. His grave in Westwood Memorial Park has a headstone that simply reads, """"Burt Lancaster, 1913-1994"".      He was offered the Montgomery Clift role in Red River (1948) by agent Charles K. Feldman, who was trying to sign the former acrobat, but Lancaster had just signed with agent Harold Hecht and so turned down the role to star in The Killers (1946), his film debut.      In honor of his 100th birthday, Turner Classic Movies honored Lancaster as their Star of the Month for November 2013.      He was wanted for The Wild Geese (1978), but thought it inferior, and Ashanti (1979), which he was interested in, but terms couldn\'t be agreed.      During the Great Depression, he supported himself working as a nude artists model by day and a singing waiter by night.      In the late 1940s, he was in negotiation to appear as the male lead in a film entitled ""A Sinner Kissed An Angel"" opposite Laraine Day but the project never materialized because Lancaster hated the storyline and refused to do it, making the studio call the whole thing off.      Release of the book, ""Burt Lancaster"" by Minty Clinch. [1985]      Release of the book, ""Burt Lancaster: An American Life"" by Kate Buford. [2000]      New York City: In the year that marks the centennial of his birth in 1913, Lancaster is being honored with a 12-film tribute at Lincoln Center ranging from 1946\'s The Killers (1946) to _Atlantic City (1981)_ in 1981. [May 2013]      Release of the book, ""Against Type: The Biography of Burt Lancaster"" by Gary Fishgall. [1995]      Did not start acting until he was 31 years old.      Was considered for Gregory Peck\'s role in Twelve O\'Clock High (1949).      Turned down the lead role in Dark City (1950) which went to Charlton Heston as his film debut.      He sought the role of Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather (1972) before Marlon Brando was cast but was never considered for it.      Despite his reputation for physical strength and agility, Lancaster was a chain smoker.      He appeared in eight films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: From Here to Eternity (1953), The Rose Tattoo (1955), Separate Tables (1958), Elmer Gantry (1960), Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), Airport (1970), Atlantic City, USA (1980) and Field of Dreams (1989). Of those, only From Here to Eternity (1953) is a winner in the category.      He was reported to have gone into a coma on his 80th birthday.      A very strong and agile man - despite chain smoking - due to his years as a circus acrobat, Lancaster unfortunately lost two roles in the films of Cecil B. DeMille due to politics, the films in question being Samson and Delilah (1949) and The Greatest Show On Earth (1952). Lancaster was a liberal Democrat while DeMille was a conservative Republican.      According to his will, after his death, there was no funeral nor memorial service.      Sidney Pollack says that up until 1975, when he was in his sixties, Burt Lancaster was still doing giant swings at the bar, smoked cigarettes, drank Martinis every night and jogged three times a week.      Lancaster told Bernardo Bertolucci on the set of Novecento (1976) he had undergone so much plastic surgery over the years that his eyes were his only real facial feature. He wore a hairpiece in later films but left it off for artistic films.Personal Quotes (20)      Most people seem to think I\'m the kind of guy who shaves with a blowtorch. Actually I\'m bookish and worrisome.      [on being a director] It\'s the best job in the picture business because when you\'re a director, you\'re God. And you know that\'s the best job in town.      Life is to be lived within the limits of your knowledge and within the concept of what you would like to see yourself to be.      [speaking in 1983] Tits and sand - that\'s what we used to call sex and violence in Hollywood.      I don\'t know why Airport (1970) was nominated for any Oscars - it\'s the biggest piece of junk ever.      We\'re all forgotten sooner or later. But not films. That\'s all the memorial we should need or hope for.      I woke up one day a star. It was terrifying. Then I worked hard toward becoming a good actor.      [advice to actor Bruce Davison, on the set of Ulzana\'s Raid (1972)] You try to please the director, and the cameraman and the soundman, and you\'re acting and acting and acting and by the time you come to your close-up, you\'ve shot your wad. It\'s like making love to a woman: you can\'t try to come all at once, son. A bit of a tit here, a bit of an inner thigh there, and you have a performance!      [upon being offered Ben-Hur (1959)] I don\'t want to make this film. It\'s a piece of crap.      If I\'m working with frightened people, I do tend to dominate them. I\'m no doll, that\'s for sure.      [on Kirk Douglas] Kirk would be the first to admit that he\'s difficult to work with - and I would be the second.      [in 1976] Whether you like it or not, when you\'re 62 you are fulfilled.      [in 1985] If anyone should have gotten AIDS from an active sex life, it is me.      [on Montgomery Clift] He had so much power, so much concentration. Clift was a complicated man, there\'s no question about it. He was a very sweet man, Monty, very emotional.      [on Kirk Douglas] We both came from, sort of, well, shall we say, humble beginnings. We were both young, brash, cocky, arrogant. We knew everything, were highly opinionated. We were invincible. Nobody liked us.      In my opinion, Shirley Booth is the finest actress I have ever worked with.      [on working with Montgomery Clift on From Here to Eternity (1953)] The only time I was ever really afraid as an actor was that first scene with Clift. It was my scene, understand: I was the sergeant, I gave the orders, he was just a private under me. Well, when we started, I couldn\'t stop my knees from shaking. I thought they might have to stop because my trembling would show. I was afraid he was going to blow me right off the screen.      Genius is a pretty dangerous thing to have. Genius is too erratic. It\'s better just to be talented.      [on Go Tell the Spartans (1978)] One of the best scripts I\'ve read and certainly the best I\'ve had for myself in a few years.      [In 1984 about his career] When I think of my least favorite, I think of Rope of Sand (1949). I did that thing under great duress. I hated it.Salary (9)The Killers\xa0(1946)      $20,000       Brute Force\xa0(1947)      $45,000       Desert Fury\xa0(1947)      $1,250 /week      From Here to Eternity\xa0(1953)      $120,000       The Young Savages\xa0(1961)      $150,000       Birdman of Alcatraz\xa0(1962)      $150,000       The Train\xa0(1964)      $150,000       The Hallelujah Trail\xa0(1965)      $150,000       Twilight\'s Last Gleaming\xa0(1977)      $750,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nAnn Richards ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 13 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(2)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(2)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(8)  Overview (2)Date of Birth13\xa0December1917,\xa0Sydney, New South Wales, Australia Date of Death24\xa0August2006,\xa0Torrance, California, USA Mini Bio (1)          Ann Richards was born on December 13, 1917 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

Born on March 20, 1914 in Dracut, Massachusetts, in the northeastern part of the Commonwealth near the New Hampshire border, Corey was the son of a Congregationalist clergyman. After receiving his education, Corey began his acting career in summer stock. During the Depression he worked with the Federal Theater Project, part of the Works Progress Administration that had been created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to put the unemployed to work. It was while working with the Federal Theater Project in the late 1930s that he met his wife, Alice Wiley.He made his Broadway debut in ""Comes the Revelation"" in 1942, a flop that lasted only two performances. His next play, ""Strip for Action"" (1942-43), was more successful, lasting 110 performances. He appeared in more plays in supporting roles from 1943-45, before making his reputation as the cynical newspaperman in Elmer Rice\'s hit comedy ""Dream Girl,"" which ran for 341 performances in the 1945-46 season. He was discovered during the run of the play by producer Hal B. Wallis, the former head of production at Warner Bros. who was an independent producer affiliated with Paramount Pictures. Wallis, who discovered Burt Lancaster shortly after the war, signed Corey to a Paramount contract.It was at Paramount that he made his movie debut in Desert Fury (1947). He went on to a career as a supporting player in the \'40s and \'50s in A-level productions with top Hollywood stars.

If you are into nail biting suspense in your movies look no further
than SORRY,WRONG NUMBER. An excellently structured climactic noir
thriller made by Paramount Pictures in 1948. Produced by Hal Wallis and
director Anotole Litvak it bears all the hallmarks of what was best in
Hollywood's Golden Age when it came to producing great thrillers. With
its slick and stylish black and white cinematography by legendary Sol
Polito, masterful direction by Litvak it boasted a magnificent central
performance from its star Barbara Stanwyck. Written by Lucille Fletcher
the film is an expanded version of her hugely successful radio play.
And to give it greater depth and density the picture is underlined by a
terrific score by Franz Waxman (Over the titles an ostinato figure in
the horns cleverly simulates the busy signal of a telephone).<br><br>Stanwyck is Leona Stevenson the pampered well to do daughter of
industrial magnate James Cotterell (the always excellent Ed Begley).
She pursues and marries beneath her a lowly drug store assistant Henry
Stevenson (a miscast Burt Lancaster) much to the chagrin of her father
(""Who is he anyhow? Why he hasn't even got a proper job!). The marriage
however is doomed from the very start. Cotterell sets his son-in-law up
in an executive position but Henry is unable to take the domineering
ways of the spoiled Leona and wants to leave her culminating in his
embezzling from the company and the degeneration of Leona into a
bedridden neurotic invalid. The film's primary setting then takes place

Anatole Litvak directs the movie version of Lucille Fletcher's radio
war-horse Sorry, Wrong Number was gusto and drive. The photograpy is
deceptively simple at first blush, but soon evolves, giving each scene an
individuality and clarity not unlike deep-focus. There's an overall feeling
of gloom in this largely nocturnal movie, which is stylistically a sort of
vest-pocket film noir Citizen Kane. Some of the touches border on the
surreal, such as Lancaster's (among others) repeated references to his home
town of Grassville, which happened at least thirty-six times and grows
alternately funnier and more disturbing with each passing mention. The feel
of New York in summer has seldom been so well captured in a studio-bound
film, as scene upon scene appears to be enveloped in fog or cigarette smoke,
and the horns of boats moving down-river or out to sea are often audible, at
times suggesting, not wholly inapprpriately, the world of Eugene O'Neill and
his theme of universal frustration. For all this, there is little actual
movement in the film, which reflects the heroine's bed-ridden state, as
scenes are acted out semi-theatrically, with characters talking to one
another continuously, and whether wicked or benign seldom communicating
clearly, as each little chat leaves someone more in the dark than before.
The story moves, one might say, from one misinterpretation to another, until
the climax, when all becomes clear, as tragedy trumps melodrama, giving the
viewer a much needed jolt of reality.

When I first started watching this film, I wasn't hooked until well
into the movie. Seeing the bed-ridden Stanwyck's monologue just didn't
hook me--even when she accidentally overheard a plot to kill someone. A
lot of this was because her character wasn't very likable--she was a
very whiny little ""princess"" who frankly annoyed me! This is why I rate
the movie lower than many on IMDb--I just didn't care much about her
and early on I was hoping that SHE would be the one murdered. However,
as the story unfolded in a series of flashback, the film became less
claustrophobic and very entertaining. None of this really made me hate
Stanwyck's character less, but it did help the audience to understand
her more--as well as her husband (Burt Lancaster). While the story
still was hampered by a long list of unlikable characters (actually, I
never really liked any of them--except maybe Wendell Corey), it did
excel by being super-creative and for ending on a very powerful note.
The film was a lot like the first drop on a roller-coaster--very slow
and uphill until a wonderful conclusion. I'd like to say more, but
don't want to spoil the film.<br><br>The movie had generally good and very creative writing, good direction
and excellent acting. It certainly WAS creative, but allowing Stanwyck
to be more three-dimensional would have improved the film greatly.

If you are into nail biting suspense in your movies look no further
than SORRY,WRONG NUMBER. An excellently structured climactic noir
thriller made by Paramount Pictures in 1948. Produced by Hal Wallis and
director Anotole Litvak it bears all the hallmarks of what was best in
Hollywood's Golden Age when it came to producing great thrillers. With
its slick and stylish black and white cinematography by legendary Sol
Polito, masterful direction by Litvak it boasted a magnificent central
performance from its star Barbara Stanwyck. Written by Lucille Fletcher
the film is an expanded version of her hugely successful radio play.
And to give it greater depth and density the picture is underlined by a
terrific score by Franz Waxman (Over the titles an ostinato figure in
the horns cleverly simulates the busy signal of a telephone).<br><br>Stanwyck is Leona Stevenson the pampered well to do daughter of
industrial magnate James Cotterell (the always excellent Ed Begley).
She pursues and marries beneath her a lowly drug store assistant Henry
Stevenson (a miscast Burt Lancaster) much to the chagrin of her father
(""Who is he anyhow? Why he hasn't even got a proper job!). The marriage
however is doomed from the very start. Cotterell sets his son-in-law up
in an executive position but Henry is unable to take the domineering
ways of the spoiled Leona and wants to leave her culminating in his
embezzling from the company and the degeneration of Leona into a
bedridden neurotic invalid. The film's primary setting then takes place
during one night and concentrates on Leona in bed and alone in her big
house trying to contact Henry on her bedside phone. Then on a crossed
line she suddenly overhears two men plotting a murder that is to happen
that night. Frantically she phones the police first, then her father,
her doctor (Wendell Corey) and her husband's secretary but either they
are not answering and or no one will believe her. It isn't very long

Paul\'s father was Jewish, the son of immigrants from Poland and Hungary; he owned a successful sporting goods store. Paul\'s mother, a practicing Christian Scientist of Slovak decent, and his uncle Joe, had an interest in creative arts, and it rubbed off on him. He acted in grade school and high school plays. The Newmans were a well-to-do family, and Paul grew up in a nice home in Shaker Heights.By 1950, the 25-year-old Newman had been kicked out of Ohio University for unruly behavior, served three years in the United States Navy during World War II as a radio operator, graduated from Ohio\'s Kenyon College, married his first wife, Jackie, and had his first child, Scott. 1950 was also the year that Paul\'s father died. When he became successful in later years, Newman said if he had any regrets it would be that his father wasn\'t around to see it. He brought Jackie back to Shaker Heights and he ran his father\'s store for a short period. Then, knowing that wasn\'t the career path he wanted to take, he moved Jackie and Scott to New Haven, Connecticut, where he attended Yale University\'s School of Drama. While doing a play there, Paul was spotted by two agents, who invited him to come to New York City to pursue a career as a professional actor. After moving to New York, Paul acted in guest spots for various television series and in 1953 came a big break. He got the part of understudy of the lead role in the successful Broadway play ""Picnic"". Through this play, he met actress Joanne Woodward, who was also an understudy in the play. While they got on very well and there was a strong attraction, Paul was married and his second child, Susan, was born that year. During this time, Newman was also accepted into the much admired and popular New York Actors Studio, although he wasn\'t technically auditioning.In 1954, a film Paul was very reluctant to do was released, The Silver Chalice (1954). He considered his performance in this costume epic to be so bad that he took out a full-page ad in a trade paper apologizing for it to anyone who might have seen it. He had always been embarrassed about the film and reveled in making fun of it. He immediately wanted to return to the stage, and performed in ""The Desperate Hours"". In 1956, Newman got the chance to redeem himself in the film world by portraying boxer Rocky Graziano in Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956), and critics praised his performance. In 1957, with a handful of films to his credit, he was cast in The Long, Hot Summer (1958), co-starring none other than Joanne Woodward. During the shooting of this film, they realized they were meant to be together and by now, so did Paul\'s wife Jackie. After Jackie gave Paul a divorce, he and Joanne married in Las Vegas in January 1958. They went on to have three daughters together and raised them in Westport, Connecticut. In 1959, Paul received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958). The 1960s would bring Paul Newman into superstar status, as he became one of the most popular actors of the decade, and garnered three more Best Actor Oscar nominations, for The Hustler (1961), Hud (1963) and Cool Hand Luke (1967). In 1968, his debut directorial effort Rachel, Rachel (1968) was given good marks, and although the film and Joanne Woodward were nominated for Oscars, Newman was not nominated for Best Director. However, he did win a Golden Globe Award for his direction.1969 brought the popular screen duo Paul Newman and Robert Redford together for the first time when Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) was released. It was a box office smash. Through the 1970s, Newman had hits and misses from such popular films as The Sting (1973) and The Towering Inferno (1974) to lesser known films as The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean (1972) to a cult classic Slap Shot (1977). After the death of his only son, Scott, in 1978, Newman\'s personal life and film choices moved in a different direction. His acting work in the 1980s and on is what is often most praised by critics today. He became more at ease with himself and it was evident in The Verdict (1982) for which he received his sixth Best Actor Oscar nomination and in 1987 finally received his first Oscar for The Color of Money (1986). Friend and director of Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956), Robert Wise accepted the award on Newman\'s behalf as he did not attend the ceremony. Films were not the only thing on his mind during this period. A passionate race car driver since the early 1970s, Newman became co-owner of Newman-Haas racing in 1982, and also founded ""Newman\'s Own"", a successful line of food products that has earned in excess of $100 million, every penny of which Newman donated to charity. He also started The Hole in the Wall Gang Camps, an organization for children with serious illness. He was as well known for his philanthropic ways and highly successful business ventures as he was for his legendary actor status.Newman enjoyed a 50-year marriage to Joanne in Connecticut, their main residence since moving away from the bright lights of Hollywood in 1960. Renowned for his sense of humor, in 1998 he quipped that he was a little embarrassed to see his salad dressing grossing more than his movies. During his later years, he still attended races, was much involved in his charitable organizations, and in 2006, he opened a restaurant called Dressing Room, which helps out the Westport Country Playhouse, a place that Paul took great pride in. In 2007, he made some headlines when he said that he was losing his invention and confidence in his acting abilities and that acting is ""pretty much a closed book for me."" He died on September 26, 2008 at age 83 of lung cancer. Whether he was on the screen or not, Paul Newman remained synonymous with the anti-heroism of the 1960s and 1970s cinema, and with the rebellious nature his characters so often embodied.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Tom McDonough          Spouse (2) Joanne Woodward (29 January\xa01958            - 26 September\xa02008)\xa0(his death)\xa0(3 children)                         Jacqueline E.

While he played similar system-bucking, troubled young men as such near contemporaries as Marlon Brando and James Dean, Newman\'s characters were often more humorous, introspective and self-assured. Newman\'s character\'s conflicts were often ironic and (intentionally) borderline-absurd.

Within a space of five months in 2003, he was nominated for an Oscar (for Road to Perdition (2002)), a Tony (for ""Our Town"") and an Emmy (for Our Town (2003)).      Although he played the lead male roles in the original productions of three Broadway classics near the beginning of his career - ""The Desperate Hours"", ""Picnic"" and ""Sweet Bird of Youth"" - Newman did not receive a Tony Award nomination until 2003, when at age 78, he was nominated as Best Actor for his performance in the 2002 revival of the ""Our Town"".      Was so ashamed of his debut in the failed costume drama The Silver Chalice (1954), that he took out an ad in Variety apologizing for his performance.

He was voted the 13th Greatest Movie Star of all time by Entertainment Weekly.      The fourth nomination on Empire magazine\'s ""Gods Among Us"" series along with Al Pacino, Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson.      Students at Princeton University have named 24 April Newman\'s Day. Students try to drink 24 beers over the 24 hours of the day. The tradition stems from a comment that Newman is alleged to have made; ""24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case. Coincidence? I think not."" The event is not officially sponsored by the university, and Newman has commented that he would ""like to bring an end to the tradition"".      He and Frank Sinatra are the only actors to win an acting Academy Award, a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and a Special/Honorary Academy Award. Sinatra won the Best Supporting Actor Award (1953), the Humanitarian Award (1970) and a Special Award (1945, Best Short Subject The House I Live In (1945)). Newman won the Best Actor Award (1986), the Humanitarian Award (1993) and an Honorary Award (1985) for lifetime achievement.Lee Strasberg, who trained Newman at the Actors Studio, said that he would have been as great an actor as Marlon Brando if he had not been so handsome. According to Strasberg, Newman had the talent, but he too often relied on his good looks to coast through a role.      Stumped the United States for Eugene McCarthy during his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic Party presidential nomination in 1968. Newman made the cover of Life magazine with a McCarthy pin on his jacket on the May 10, 1968 issue.      Appeared on Quigley Publications\' annual poll of the Top Ten Money Making Stars 14 times from 1963 to 1986, which ranks him #7 for all-time in appearances in the top 10. He trails Bing Crosby, who made the list 15 times, Clark Gable (16 appearances on the list), Gary Cooper and Tom Cruise (18 times each), Clint Eastwood (21 times) and John Wayne (25 times).      Was named the #1 Box Office Star by Quigley Publications in its annual Top Ten Money Making Stars poll of movie exhibitors two years in a row, 1969 and 1970. Newman had been #2 in 1968 and #3 in \'67 and would rank #3 in both 1971 and 1974. Newman, who entered the list for the first time in 1963 at #9 and the last time in 1986 at #10, has made the list 17 times.      Early in his acting career, he was often mistaken for Marlon Brando. He claims to have signed around 500 autographs reading, ""Best wishes, Marlon Brando"".      Premiere magazine ranked him as the #6 Greatest Movie Star of All Time in their Stars in Our Constellation feature (2005).Otto Preminger, Jewish himself, cast him in Exodus (1960) because he wanted someone of Jewish heritage who did not ""look Jewish"".      Was a Brother of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity at Ohio University.      He was nominated for nine acting Academy Awards in five different decades - the 1950s (Best Lead Actor for Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958)), 1960s (Best Lead Actor for The Hustler (1961), Hud (1963) and Cool Hand Luke (1967)), the 1980s (Best Lead Actor for Absence of Malice (1981), The Verdict (1982) and The Color of Money (1986) winning for this last film), the 1990s (Best Lead Actor for Nobody\'s Fool (1994)) and finally in Road to Perdition (2002) for Best Supporting Actor.      He and his daughter Nell Potts were supposed to be in Paper Moon (1973) in the leading roles, but this changed when original director John Huston bowed out and was replaced by Peter Bogdanovich.      The role of Rocky Graziano in Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956) was originally awarded to James Dean, who died before filming began. Due to Dean\'s untimely death, Newman was cast in the role. Dean also was signed to play Billy the Kid in The Left Handed Gun (1958), but that role was also inherited by Newman after Dean\'s death. Dean and Newman had shot their last screen tests for East of Eden (1955) together; the six-years-younger Dean got the role and Newman went on to star in The Silver Chalice (1954), a notorious turkey.      He is only one of six performers to be nominated for an Oscar twice for playing the same role in two separate films. He was nominated as Fast Eddie Felson in The Hustler (1961) and The Color of Money (1986). The other five are Bing Crosby as Father O\'Malley in Going My Way (1944) and The Bells of St. Mary\'s (1945), Peter O\'Toole as Henry II in Becket (1964) and The Lion in Winter (1968), Al Pacino as Michael Corleone in The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather: Part II (1974), Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth I in Elizabeth (1998) and Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007), and Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa in Rocky (1976) and Creed (2015).      He had one brother, Arthur S. Newman Jr., who was named after their father, Arthur S. Newman, a successful sporting goods store owner.Michelle Pfeiffer wanted Newman to play her father, patriarch Larry Cook, in the drama A Thousand Acres (1997), which she produced. Newman turned down the role, which went to Jason Robards.      When Premiere magazine does a list of 24 Great Performances from each year, they often ask the actors who their idols are. Newman has been the most frequently cited idol so far.      Was nominated 10 times for the Academy Award, including eight times as Best Actor, once as Best Supporting Actor, and once for Best Picture (the latter coming the same year he famously did not receive a Best Director nomination despite having won the then-equally prestigious New York Critics Award as Best Director for Rachel, Rachel (1968). In the acting field, the only actors with more nominations are Jack Nicholson with 12 nominations (8 Best Actor and 4 Best Supporting Actor nominations) and Laurence Olivier (nine Best Actor nominations and 1 Best Supporting Actor nod). On the distaff side, Bette Davis, who was nominated 10 times for an Academy Award, all of them Best Actress nods. Katharine Hepburn, with 12 nods (all in the Best Actress category) and Meryl Streep, with 20 nods have more acting nominations than Newman.      Is one of only six actors to be nominated for acting honors by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences over five decades (1950s, 1960s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s). Laurence Olivier (1930s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s), Katharine Hepburn (1930s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1980s), Jack Nicholson (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s) and Michael Caine (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s) Meryl Streep (1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s) are the others who have turned the trick.      Has donated between $150 million-$175 million to charity since the 1980s.      His performance as Frank Galvin in The Verdict (1982) is ranked #19 on Premiere magazine\'s 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006).      His performance as Fast Eddie Felson in The Hustler (1961) is ranked #64 on Premiere magazine\'s 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006).      Was director Robert Wise\'s first pick for the lead in The Sand Pebbles (1966), eventually played by Steve McQueen, who won his only Oscar nomination for the role. Wise had earlier directed Newman in Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956) and Until They Sail (1957).      Turned down the role of the shark hunter Quint in Jaws (1975), which went to Robert Shaw.

This is a ranking which he shares with Robert Redford, who played the Sundance Kid.      His performance as Luke Jackson in Cool Hand Luke (1967) is ranked #30 on the American Film Institute\'s 100 Heroes & Villains.      Ranked the #1 Box Office star of 1969 and 1970 by Quigley Publications\' annual poll of the Top Ten Money Making Stars. He was ranked #2 in 1968 and at #3 in 1967, 1971 and 1974. In all, he made the Top Ten list 14 times from 1963, when he entered it at #9, and 1986, when he bowed out of the Top 10 at #10. He was ranked in the Top Ten for 10 straight years from 1966-1975, peaking in the Top Three from 1967 to 1971.      The GI Bill got him through his first three months at Yale University. To pay tuition for the rest of his time there, he sold Encyclopedia Britannica. He claims he was very good at it.      For a Mother\'s Day gift, he gave wife Joanne Woodward two hours of uninterrupted driving around the roads of Westport, Connecticut that they had never seen before.      Said he did not want his epitaph to say two things: ""Here lies Paul Newman, who died a failure because his eyes turned brown"" and ""Here lies the old man who wasn\'t a part of his time."" (1960s).      Godfather of Jake Gyllenhaal.      Great admirer of Jim Carrey.      While campaigning for the Democrats in the 1968 U.S. Presidential election, Newman would rent a Jaguar on the weekends. When he found out that opponent Richard Nixon, who was known to his naysayers as ""Tricky Dick"", was renting the same car during the week, Newman left a note in it saying ""This clutch is tricky, so you won\'t have any trouble with it."".      Prior to filming The Hustler (1961), Newman lacked talent at playing pool. But after brushing up on it for the role, he felt very confident in his ability. So he bet co-star Jackie Gleason $50 on a game of pool. Being the excellent pool player he was, Gleason beat Newman. Instead of paying him in dollar bills, Newman dumped $50 worth of pennies on the table for Gleason to take.      When Newman failed to receive an Oscar nomination for his performance in Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956), producer Charles Schnee and director Robert Wise gave him what they called a ""Noscar"". The engraving says, ""The Schnee-Wise Noscar award to Paul Newman for best portraying a terrible no-good, for turning him into a charming and lovable sprite, and for thereby doing what Lincoln said should never be done, i.e. fooling all of the people all of the time."".      After being asked so many times what the secret was to being married so long to Joanne Woodward, he was asked yet again and simply responded, ""I don\'t know what she puts in my food."".      One of the most sought after and valuable collectible Rolex watches, the early ""Daytona"" model, from the 1960s, is known unofficially and passionately worldwide, as the Rolex ""Paul Newman"". ""Paul Newmans"" in steel fetch as much as $100,000 in auctions. This nickname was adopted as he sported one in film.      A film poster of him in Hud (1963) appears in Midnight Cowboy (1969).      During the 1950s and 1960s, he was close friends with fellow Democrat and civil rights activist Charlton Heston. In 1983, after Heston\'s political beliefs had moved to the Right, both actors took opposing sides in a television debate on President Ronald Reagan\'s Star Wars defense missile program. Heston, much better briefed and prepared than Newman, was judged to have won the debate easily. Some years later, when Newman learned that Heston was supposed to introduce him at an awards ceremony, Newman insisted that his one-time friend be replaced by the liberal Donald Sutherland.      Supported Senator Ted Kennedy\'s campaign to win the Democratic presidential nomination in 1980.      In 2007, his auto racing team, known as Newman-Haas, became Newman/Haas/Lanigan due to Chicago businessman Michael Lanigan becoming a partner.

He had previously announced his retirement in 1995, but came back to make four more movies. [May 2007]      Opened a restaurant called ""Dressing Room"" with co-owner and chef Michael Nischan in Westport, Connecticut. It was originally opened to help subsidize the Westport Country Playhouse, which sits next to it (2006).      He was a vocal supporter of gay marriage.      Was offered the role of Judah Ben-Hur in Ben-Hur (1959), which he turned down because he said he did not have the legs to wear a tunic.      Got two roles which were first offered to Elvis Presley but which were turned down by Presley\'s manager: Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958) and Sweet Bird of Youth (1962).The Eiger Sanction (1975) was originally intended as a vehicle for him.      His father, Arthur Sigmund Newman, died in 1950 at age 55 and his mother, Theresa Newman, died in 1982 at age 86.      Announced that his Champ Car team is merging with NASCAR team Robert Yates Racing. It is now called Yates/Newman/Haas/Lanigan racing. Newman said the deal ""in no way lessens our commitment to open-wheel racing. We want to broaden our horizons."". [July 2007]      Ranked #19 in Empire magazine\'s 100 Sexiest Movie Stars of All Time (2007).      Became a rear gunner of a TBF Avenger torpedo bomber when his color blindness disqualified him from being a pilot.      Longtime supporter of gun control, and a member of Handgun Control Inc.      Supported anti-war Senator Eugene McCarthy\'s bid to win the Democratic nomination from incumbent President Lyndon Johnson in 1968, and actively campaigned for George McGovern in the 1972 presidential election.      According to Joe McGinnis\' book about the advertising industry\'s participation in Richard Nixon\'s 1968 campaign, the first telethon for the Eugene McCarthy Campaign, which was emceed by Newman, raised $125,000 (about $800,000 in 2008 money, when factored for inflation, a good sum for the time). Nixon\'s advertising people attributed the success of the telethon to Newman\'s participation.      In the 1970s, long before Brokeback Mountain (2005), he was thwarted by Hollywood in his desire to star in the movie version of the best-selling novel ""The Front Runner"", about the love affair between a male coach and a male star runner. The project remains unmade.      Supported Al Franken\'s campaign for election as United States Senator from Minnesota.      Attended the main Democratic fundraiser for Senator John Kerry before the Democratic National Convention at Radio City Music Hall, along with Whoopi Goldberg, Jon Bon Jovi, Meryl Streep, Sarah Jessica Parker, Mary J. Blige, Chevy Chase and Jessica Lange (August 13, 2004).      Donated $1 million to ""The Nation"" magazine in order to keep it going.

The other five are Joel Coen directing Frances McDormand in Fargo (1996), John Cassavetes directing Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence (1974) & Gloria (1980), Blake Edwards directing Julie Andrews in Victor Victoria (1982), Paul Czinner directing Elisabeth Bergner in Escape Me Never (1935) and Richard Brooks directing Jean Simmons in The Happy Ending (1969). Jules Dassin also directed his future wife Melina Mercouri in an Oscar-nominated performance (Pote tin Kyriaki (1960)), but they weren\'t married yet at the time of the nomination.      Turned down the role of Harry Callahan in Dirty Harry (1971) because he thought the screenplay was too right-wing, and recommended Clint Eastwood for the role instead.      Grandfather of Peter (born May 1996) and Henry Elkind, the sons of his daughter Melissa ""Lissy"" Newman and her husband Raphael ""Raphe"" Elkind.      Father-in-law to Gary Irving (husband of Elinor ""Nell"" Newman), Raphael ""Raphe"" Elkind (husband of Melissa ""Lissy"" Newman) and Kurt Soderlund (husband of Claire ""Clea"" Newman).      Known as an inveterate prankster, he and Robert Redford in particular played numerous pranks on each other. One time, Redford, who was also into car racing, had a beaten-up Porsche shell delivered to Newman\'s porch for Newman\'s 50th birthday. Newman never said anything, but not long after, Redford found a crate of the (now) molten metal delivered to the living room of a house Redford rented, which dented the floor. Not to be outdone, Redford then had the metal turned into an incredibly ugly sculpture and dropped into Newman\'s garden.      He and Frank Sinatra are the only people who were awarded a competitive Oscar, an Honorary Award and a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS).      Once, when he was handing out punch at a Westport charity event, a dowager asked him to stir her drink with his finger. ""I\'d be glad to,"" Newman replied, ""but I just took it out of a cyanide bottle."".      Did all of his own driving in films.      Said in an interview that a film had never made any special impact on him until he saw On the Waterfront (1954).      The animated comedy Cars (2006), his last film, was the highest-grossing film of his career.      The series episode The Simpsons: Lost Verizon (2008), was dedicated to his memory.      Turned down Donald Sutherland\'s role in A Time to Kill (1996) because he found the film\'s justification of murder distasteful.      Chosen by GQ magazine as one of the 50 Most Stylish Men in the Past 50 Years.      His first wife, Jacqueline ""Jackie"" Witte, was born in September 1929.      He was director William Friedkin\'s first choice for the lead role of Popeye Doyle in The French Connection (1971), but he was deemed too expensive. The role went to Newman\'s good friend Gene Hackman.      Turned down the lead role of Jackie Scanlon in Sorcerer (1977), which eventually went to Roy Scheider.      Profiled in ""American Classic Screen Interviews"" (Scarecrow Press) (2010).      Inducted into the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Hall of Fame in 2009.      Directed three actors to Oscar nominations: Joanne Woodward (Best Actress, Rachel, Rachel (1968)), Estelle Parsons (Best Supporting Actress, Rachel, Rachel (1968)), and Richard Jaeckel (Best Supporting Actor, Sometimes a Great Notion (1970)).      Like his dear friend Robert Redford, both men had firstborn sons named Scott who predeceased their fathers.      Newman was expelled from Ohio University for denting the college president\'s car with a beer keg.      He was the only performer, to date, to receive an Oscar for a repeated role. He won as Fast Eddie Felson in The Color of Money (1986), having been previously nominated as the same character in The Hustler (1961).      Was announced as co-star with Spencer Tracy and Robert Mitchum in the Jerry Wald production of ""The Enemy Within"", based on the book by Attorney General Robert Kennedy, which at 1962/63 was in preparation for 20th Century Fox.      Presented with the Golden Turkey Award for the Most Embarrassing Movie Debut of All Time for his performance in The Silver Chalice (1954). His response was that he fully agreed with the award.      He was never happy at signing autographs and stopped completely after a man asked him for one while he was stood at a urinal in a gents toilet at a restaurant.      Often said that of all the films he had performed in, Slap Shot (1977) was the most fun and his personal favorite.      Attended the month long festivities at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in support of the Indianapolis 500. [May 2008]      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7060 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on February 1, 1994.      The longest period he had gone without an Oscar nomination was 13 years between his Best Picture nomination for Rachel, Rachel (1968) and his Best Actor nomination for Absence of Malice (1981).      Had appeared in six films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), The Hustler (1961), Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), The Sting (1973), The Towering Inferno (1974), The Verdict (1982). Only The Sting (1973) won in the category.      This was little known that he was a skilled jazz and blue piano player, like Clint Eastwood. One photo was taken which appears to show him playing while Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin sing, while Robert Mitchum and James Garner look on.      Did not start training to be an actor until he was age 26.      The births of his and Joanne\'s daughters were announced in the Milestones columns of the Time magazine issues for 20 April 1959, 6 October 1961, and 30 April 1965 respectively; while his oldest grandson Peter\'s birth was announced in the Passages column of People magazine\'s 3 June 1996 issue.      Pictured on a USA \'forever\' postage stamp issued 18 September 2015. Price on day of issue was 49¢.      His and Joanne\'s daughters are named after their moms the first Character she ever played on film and a Character in Lawrence Durrell\'s novel the Alexandria Quartet during her last pregnancy they had hoped for a boy so when it was another girl they chose Claire ""Clea"" from the Durrell novel which Joanne had been reading in the weeks before she gave birth.      He later regretting making Exodus (1960).      He was a heavy smoker for thirty years.      Separated from his wife during the filming of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) due to his affair with journalist Nancy Bacon.      Became friends with future Prime Minister of Sweden, Olof Palme when they were students at Kenyon College in Ohio in 1940s.      With the change in zodiac signs he would now be a Capricorn instead of an Aquarius and Joanne is now an Aquarius instead of a Pisces.      Paul Newman passed away on September 26, 2008, four months away from what would have been his 84th birthday on January 26, 2009.      ""Reprises"" his role as Doc Hudson in Cars 3 (2017) via unused recordings from Cars (2006).Personal Quotes (75)      [responding to an interviewer\'s question as to why he was never ""tempted"" by the many beautiful Hollywood actresses he worked with] Why fool around with hamburger when you have steak at home?      [in response to radio interviewer who asked if he would co-star with Robert Redford in a sequel to Indecent Proposal (1993)] Like a rocket! I\'d shack up with anyone for a million dollars. I\'d shack up with a gorilla for a million, plus 10%.      [1974, on the success of his collaborations with wife Joanne Woodward] You should see us when we get back to the bedroom.      [1982] Acting is like letting your pants down - you\'re exposed.      The embarrassing thing is that my salad dressing is out-grossing my films.      [on philanthropy] You can only put away so much stuff in your closet.      I really just can\'t watch myself. I see all the machinery at work and it just drives me nuts.      If I ever feel like I\'m doing something I\'ve done before, I scrap it and start over again.      When I realized I was going to have to be a whore, to put my face on the label, I decided that the only way I could do it was to give away all the money we make. Over the years, that ethical stance has given us a 30 per cent boost. One in three customers buys my products because all the profits go to good causes and the rest buy the stuff because it is good.      It\'s all been a bad joke that just ran out of control. I got into food for fun but the business got a mind of its own. Now - my good Lord - look where it has gotten me. My products are on supermarket shelves, in cinemas, in the theater. And they say show business is odd.      I like racing but food and pictures are more thrilling. I can\'t give them up. In racing you can be certain, to the last thousandth of a second, that someone is the best, but with a film or a\xa0recipe, there is no way of knowing how all the ingredients will work out in the end. The best can turn out to be awful and the worst can be fantastic. Cooking is like performing and performing like cooking.      I\'m a supporter of gay rights. And not a closet supporter, either. From the time I was a kid, I have never been able to understand attacks upon the gay community. There are so many qualities that make up a human being... by the time I get through with all the things that I really admire about people, what they do with their private parts is probably so low on the list that it is irrelevant.      [on Alfred Hitchcock] I think Hitch and I could have really hit it off, but the script kept getting in the way.      You can\'t be as old as I am without waking up with a surprised look on your face every morning: ""Holy Christ, whaddya know - I\'m still around!"" It\'s absolutely amazing that I survived all the booze and smoking and the cars and the career.      I was always a character actor. I just looked like Little Red Riding Hood.      If you\'re playing a poker game and you look around the table and can\'t tell who the sucker is, it\'s you.      Every time I get a script it\'s a matter of trying to know what I could do with it. I see colors, imagery. It has to have a smell. It\'s like falling in love. You can\'t give a reason why.      For those of you who like to scarf your popcorn in the sack, the good news is that Newman\'s Own contains an aphrodisiac.      Being on [President Richard Nixon\'s] enemies list was the highest single honor I\'ve ever received. Who knows who\'s listening to me now and what government list I\'m on?      I started my career giving a clinic in bad acting in the film, The Silver Chalice (1954) and now I\'m playing a crusty old man who\'s an animated automobile [in Cars (2006)]. That\'s a creative arc for you, isn\'t it?      I never ask my wife [actress Joanne Woodward] about my flaws. Instead, I try to get her to ignore them and concentrate on my sense of humor. You don\'t want any woman to look under the carpet, guys, because there\'s lots of flaws underneath. Joanne believes my character in a film we did together, Mr. & Mrs. Bridge (1990), comes closest to who I really am. I personally don\'t think there\'s one character who comes close... but I learned a long time ago not to disagree on things that I don\'t have a solid opinion about.      [his advice to young actors just starting out] Study your craft and know who you are and what\'s special about you. Find out what everyone does on a film set, ask questions and listen. Make sure you live life, which means don\'t do things where you court celebrity, and give something positive back to our society.      I\'ve repeatedly said that for people as little in common as Joanne and myself, we have an uncommonly good marriage. We are actors. We make pictures and that\'s about all we have in common. Maybe that\'s enough. Wives shouldn\'t feel obligated to accompany their husbands to a ball game, husbands do look a bit silly attending morning coffee breaks with the neighborhood wives when most men are out at work. Husbands and wives should have separate interests, cultivate different sets of friends and not impose on the other...You can\'t spend a lifetime breathing down each other\'s necks.      Twenty-five years ago, I couldn\'t walk down the street without being recognized. Now I can put a cap on, walk anywhere and no one pays me any attention. They don\'t ask me about my movies and they don\'t ask me about my salad dressing because they don\'t know who I am. Am I happy about this? You bet.      I\'ve been accused of being aloof. I\'m not. I\'m just wary.      [what wife Joanne Woodward thinks of his love for racing] She thinks competitive driving is the silliest thing in the world. It is also very scary for her, and she doesn\'t much care for it.      The first time I remember women reacting to me was when we were filming Hud (1963) in Texas. Women were literally trying to climb through the transoms at the motel where I stayed. At first, it\'s flattering to the ego. At first. Then you realize that they\'re mixing me up with the roles I play - characters created by writers who have nothing to do with who I am.      I had no natural gift to be anything--not an athlete, not an actor, not a writer, not a director, a painter of garden porches--not anything. So I\'ve worked really hard, because nothing ever came easily to me.      [on why he decided to stay in Connecticut] Better than Montana... and my wife and I found a nice cemetery here.      [on winning his first Oscar after so many losses] It\'s like chasing a beautiful woman for 80 years. Finally, she relents and you say, ""I\'m terribly sorry. I\'m tired"".      That I survived the first film I did [The Silver Chalice (1954)] was extraordinarily good fortune. I mean, I had dogs chasing me down the street. I was wearing this tiny little Greek cocktail dress - with MY legs! Good Lord, it was really bad. In fact, it was the worst film made in the 1950s. My first review said that ""Mr. Newman delivers his lines with the emotional fervor of a Putnam stop conductor announcing local stop"".      I can remember in my high school days and I kept thinking to myself, ""Now, why did those actors go out in public after a certain age?"" I mean, why would they wanna blow this image they\'d worked so hard and allow themselves to be photographed? They should have just stayed at home and stayed young and youthful. And now it\'s there for everybody to look at - all our words, stuttering, and bad posture. All those things that should never happen, really. Well, times change. Yeah, it ain\'t so bad!      [on his long marriage to Joanne Woodward] We are very, very different people and yet somehow we fed off those varied differences and instead of separating us, it has made the whole bond a lot stronger.      [explaining why he accepted The Silver Chalice (1954) for his film debut] After the success of ""Picnic"", I had a lot of offers from Hollywood and I never accepted any of them. Finally, my agent said, ""You know, they\'re going to keep knocking on your door and knocking on your door and at some point they\'re going to stop. So you better make sure you say \'Yes\' before that stop occurs"". That was when somebody sent me a copy of ""The Silver Chalice"" and I got talked into it. I knew that was going to be a bomb.      I picture my epitaph: ""Here lies Paul Newman, who died a failure because his eyes turned brown.""      [1970s] I think I get a very unfortunate view of the press. I think of what is written about me, about 5% of it is accurate. I\'m not comfortable with them, they\'re not comfortable with me. I certainly am not comfortable with photographers.      [on his days as a member of the Actors Studio] I remember someone who helped me a lot in my early days. We were just rehearsing a scene and I remember she stopped me with an absolute rifle shot of a clap and grabbed my shirt and said, ""You are not thinking, you are just thinking you are thinking."" And if you watch actors, you can tell those who don\'t necessarily indicate in broad strokes what\'s going on, but you can really see in their eyes that they are going through a process.      I\'m always puzzled by this talk about star... image. I think there\'s people who are writers or barbers or mechanics or race car drivers that have certain recognizable personalities, and I don\'t think just because they happen to be on the screen that it makes them any more exceptional.      I will continue to get behind the wheel of a racing car as long as I am able. But that could all end tomorrow...      In the early days of films, the movie star in this country replaced royalty. They\'ve been demoted since then but they\'re still treated as beings larger than life.      A man can only be judged by his actions, and not by his good intentions or his beliefs.      Acting is a question of absorbing other people\'s personalities and adding some of your own experiences.      Almost everything I learned about being an actor came from those early years at the Actor\'s Studio.      I would like it if people would think that beyond Newman, there\'s a spirit that takes action, a heart, and a talent that doesn\'t come from my blue eyes.      I don\'t think there\'s anything exceptional or noble in being philanthropic. It\'s the other attitude that confuses me.      I\'d like to be remembered as a guy who tried - who tried to be part of his times, tried to help people communicate with one another, tried to find some decency in his own life, tried to extend himself as a human being. Someone who isn\'t complacent, who doesn\'t cop out.      A man with no enemies is a man with no character.      Men experience many passions in a lifetime. One passion drives away the one before it.      Once I started taking drama classes, I asked myself why I had ever wasted so much time on a football team.      As long as my heart continues to beat, I think I will continue.      Acting isn\'t really a creative process, it\'s an interpretative one.      The characters I have the least in common with are the ones I have the greatest success with. The further a role is from my own experience, the more I try to deepen it.      To be an actor, you have to be a child.      [Joanne Woodward] has always given me unconditional support in all my choices and endeavors, and that includes my race car driving, which she deplores. To me, that\'s love.      You can\'t stop being a citizen just because you have a Screen Actors\' Guild card.      Ever since Slap Shot (1977), I\'ve been swearing more. I knew I had a problem one day when I turned to my daughter and said, ""Would you please pass the fucking salt?"".      I wasn\'t driven to acting by an inner compulsion. I was running away from the sporting goods business.      I\'m not able to work anymore as an actor and still at the level that I would want to. I\'m just, you know, you start to lose your memory, you start to lose your confidence, you start to lose your invention. So I think that\'s pretty much a closed book for me.      [asked why he thought he became so successful as an actor] I have a face that does not belong to a thief.      [2007] I have an extraordinary attention span. I manage to juggle two or three different ideas at the same time, and that\'s probably, if I have a gift, that\'s probably the best gift that\'s given me.      [on a $10-million donation he made to his alma mater] I owe Kenyon College a great deal. I even started my first business, a laundry service, there, and I depended on the extra $60 a week.      [on Dame Julie Andrews] The last of the really great dames.      [on Tom Cruise] He\'s got a lot of actor\'s courage. He doesn\'t mind climbing up there and jumping off. It\'s nice to watch that.      [on Henry Fonda] If I can be like Henry Fonda, then I look forward to aging to sixty and beyond -- and not just because Hank finally won the Oscar he deserved. He was a good character actor and a good actor in the American tradition of playing variations on oneself.      [2005] It\'d be lunatic to try to get into politics at my age. I don\'t think I\'d have the stomach for it. I wish I felt a little more comfortable about the direction that we\'re going. It does not seem to be of the people, by the people and for the people. It seems to be about something else completely different. I think part of it is the media\'s fault for not being more aggressive and persistent and nasty and I think it\'s the people\'s fault for not paying attention. That\'s not a good combination. It allows people in government to do pretty much what they want.      Once you\'ve seen your face on a bottle of salad dressing, it\'s hard to take yourself seriously.      [1994] I\'m not mellower, I\'m not less angry, I\'m not less self-critical, I\'m not less tenacious. Maybe the best part is that your liver can\'t handle those beers at noon anymore.      If anyone had ever told me 20 years ago I\'d be sitting in a room with peach walls, I would have told them to take a nap in a urinal.      I have no natural gift to be anything - not an athlete, not an actor, not a writer, not a director, a painter of garden porches - not anything. So I\'ve worked really hard, because nothing ever came easily to me.      I can say fairly safely that I didn\'t really know much about acting until I got to be in my fifties.      I felt guilty as hell about leaving my wife and children, and I will carry that guilt for the rest of my life. But the fact that Joanne and I are still together after all those years proves I took the right decision.      We are such spendthrifts with our lives. The trick of living is to slip on and off the planet with the least fuss you can muster. I\'m not running for sainthood. I just happen to think that in life we need to be a little like the farmer, who puts back into the soil what he takes out.      [on Marlon Brando] I\'ve always envied Marlon\'s talent, which was always so much greater than anybody else\'s. I feel cheated he hasn\'t made more films, but I understand his reason. I think he felt that acting was not a manly profession sometimes and sometimes I feel the same way. But with Marlon it\'s more that he\'s too good for any of this.      Acting is a question of absorbing other people\'s personalities and adding some of your own experiences.      [on his salad dressing franchise] I\'ve had more fun doing this than anything else I\'ve done in a long time. But remember: it\'s really my way of telling Ronald Reagan that his salad days are over.Salary (10)Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\xa0(1958)      $17,000       Exodus\xa0(1960)      $200,000       Sweet Bird of Youth\xa0(1962)      $350,000 + percentage of profits      Hombre\xa0(1967)      $750,000 + 10% of gross      Winning\xa0(1969)      $1,100,000       Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\xa0(1969)      $750,000       Pocket Money\xa0(1972)      $1,200,000       The Sting\xa0(1973)      $500,000 and profit participation      The Towering Inferno\xa0(1974)      $1,000,000 + 10% of gross      Blaze\xa0(1989)      $5,000,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nFredric March ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 66 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(5)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(2)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(48)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(10)  Overview (5)Date of Birth31\xa0August1897,\xa0Racine, Wisconsin, USA Date of Death14\xa0April1975,\xa0Los Angeles, California, USA      \xa0(prostate cancer)    Birth NameErnest Frederick McIntyre BickelNicknameFreddie    Height5\'\xa010""\xa0(1.78\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Fredric March began a career in banking but in 1920 found himself cast as an extra in films being produced in New York. He starred on the Broadway stage first in 1926 and would return there between screen appearances later on. He won plaudits (and an Academy Award nomination) for his send-up of John Barrymore in The Royal Family of Broadway (1930). Four more Academy Award nominations would come his way, and he would win the Oscar for Best Actor twice: for Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) and The Best Years of Our Lives (1946). He could play roles varying from heavy drama to light comedy, and was often best portraying men in anguish, such as Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman (1951). As his career advanced he progressed from leading man to character actor.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Bill Takacs <kinephile@aol.com>          Spouse (2) Florence Eldridge (30 May\xa01927            - 14 April\xa01975)\xa0(his death)\xa0(2 children)                         Ellis Baker          (3 May\xa01925            - 17 January\xa01927)\xa0(divorced)          Trivia (48)      After he and his wife Florence Eldridge appeared in the heavily panned play, ""Yr. Obedient Husband"" in 1938, they ran an ad in New York newspapers; a cartoon borrowed from the New Yorker magazine, it showed a trapeze artist missing his partner. The caption read: ""Oops! Sorry!"".      His wife, actress Florence Eldridge, appeared with him in The Studio Murder Mystery (1929), Les Misérables (1935), Mary of Scotland (1936), Another Part of the Forest (1948), An Act of Murder (1948), Christopher Columbus (1949) and Inherit the Wind (1960). On television, she appeared with him in Producers\' Showcase: Dodsworth (1956).      Adopted two children with his wife, Florence Eldridge: Penelope (""Penny,"" born 1932) and Anthony (born 1934).      His stage name was a shortened version of his mother\'s maiden name (Marcher).      Won two Tony Awards as Best Actor (Dramatic), the first in 1947 for his performance in Ruth Gordon\'s ""Years Ago"", an award shared with José Ferrer for ""Cyrano de Bergerac"", and the second, ten years later, in 1957, for his landmark performance in Eugene O\'Neill\'s ""Long Day\'s Journey Into Night"". He was also nominated in the same category in 1962 for Paddy Chayefsky\'s ""Gideon"".      In 1949, he was targeted for blacklisting by the House Un-American Activities Committee because of his supposed ""leftist"" politics.      Shares the distinction with actors José Ferrer, Helen Hayes and Ingrid Bergman of being the first winners of acting Tony Awards when the annual event was established in 1947      For a while after undergoing major surgery for prostate cancer in 1970, it seemed March\'s acting career was finished. However, he was able to give one final great performance in The Iceman Cometh (1973).      For many years, he maintained his primary residence in New Milford, Connecticut. After his death, the property was subsequently leased to playwright Lillian Hellman as well as to Henry Kissinger.Marlon Brando praised March as his favorite actor in his youth.      Although it was not used, he proposed the following epitaph for his tombstone: ""This is just my lot."".      March and his second wife were both active supporters of the Democratic Party.      He and Basil Rathbone appeared together in two television adaptations of ""A Christmas Carol"", shown in the 1950s. In the first, Shower of Stars: A Christmas Carol (1954), March played Scrooge and Rathbone played Marley\'s Ghost. In the second, Tales from Dickens: A Christmas Carol (1959), March was the narrator, and Rathbone played Scrooge.      He was the first actor to receive an Academy Award for a horror film (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931)). The next would not be until Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs (1991).      March\'s daughter, Penny, remembered her father during her growing up years as fun, charming and very kind, writing in 1990, ""I remember very well how handsome he looked back in the days when people really dressed up in the evening, and he\'d have on tails and an evening cape to go out and I got to pop up his beautiful top hat"" (Letter, Penelope March Fantacci, 12 September 1990).      He and Humphrey Bogart played chess every day during breaks in the filming of The Desperate Hours (1955).      Attended and graduated with honors from the University of Wisconsin with a degree in economics.      Elected class president in his last year of grammar school, his senior year of high school and again in his senior year of college. In college, March was the manager of the football team and a member of the track team.      Served in the United States Army during World War I as an artillery lieutenant.      In 1937, he was listed as the fifth highest paid individual in America, earning $500,000.      In 1955, an informal poll of some 30 top stars, directors and producers was tabulated and announced. March was picked as Best Film Actor two to one, with runners-up Marlon Brando, William Holden, Ronald Colman and Spencer Tracy.      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1620 Vine Street in Hollywood, California on February 8, 1960.William Holden was quoted as saying that Spencer Tracy and March were his acting ideals.      A Beverly Hills mansion built for March 1931 was the first home of Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. It is now owned by Madonna.      March was a moderate smoker, emptying a pack of cigarettes a day; allowed himself one cigar a day after dinner, and was a mild drinker. He was an avid letter writer, and he kept up a large correspondence. Whenever he was asked by a newspaper or magazine for an article, he did not allow any publicity man to ghost it for him, but wrote it himself.      A 500-seat theater was named after him on October 15, 1971, at the University of Wisconsin branch in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.      Director John Frankenheimer called March ""the finest human being I\'ve ever known, as well as the best actor I ever worked with,"" citing March\'s celebrated turns in The Iceman Cometh (1973) and Seven Days in May (1964).      When asked which he preferred making, movies or live theater, he remarked, ""Pictures are physically tiring; the theater is mentally tiring. Pictures last, the theater is built on sand. But I am grateful for my theater experience."".      He singled out The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) as his favorite movie role and ""Long Day\'s Journey into Night"" as his favorite stage play. He considered work in television ""an awful experience"".      In 1938, he came in second in an audience poll for the role of Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind (1939).      While pursuing his acting career, March--not wanting to overlook any means of keeping a little cash in his pocket--did some modeling. He immortalized shoes, shaving cream and cravats and posed for such famous artists as Charles Dana Gibson and Howard Chandler Christy and for Arrow shirt advertisements.      Because he considered 12 his lucky number, he shortened Frederick to Fredric, shortened his mother\'s maiden name from Marcher to March, and as of New Year\'s Day, 1924, Fredric March was born.      He entered the banking business in New York in 1920, working at what was then known as First National City Bank (now Citibank) when a ruptured appendix nearly killed him. While he was recuperating, his landlady (a former actress) related anecdotes from her days in the theater and he was so enchanted that he decided to pursue his real dream and become an actor.      Early in March\'s career, director John Cromwell, persuaded him to change his last name. His first wife wanted him to use his middle name and her first name: McIntyre Ellis. But he could not abide a name like that, being too used to Fred. Finally, they settled on his idea, Fredric March.      The final Hyde make-up in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) was so extreme that it almost permanently disfigured him. After filming was completed, he was hospitalized for three weeks. His co-star Rose Hobart said, ""Fredric March was lucky he wasn\'t ruined for life."".      March also appeared with his wife, Florence Eldridge, in Mary of Scotland (1936).      It seems that nobody but Jesse L. Lasky wanted to make The Adventures of Mark Twain (1944). He fought for years to convince Warner Bros. to back a screen biography of the noted writer. Director Irving Rapper was not interested in making the film until he learned his friend March was first choice to star. March had been suggested by Twain\'s only living daughter, Clara Clemens Gabrilowitch, who informed Lasky that she would not help with the picture unless March played her father. But even with such a stirring endorsement, March had his doubts. He only accepted the role after the makeup department shot a test in which he played Twain at 65. When a picture of March in makeup was released to the papers, Twain\'s daughter thought somebody had discovered another archival photo of her father.      March kept in shape by swimming, playing tennis and horseback riding. He also enjoyed golf, reading, photography and travel.      In 1943, March made tours for the USO covering nearly 40,000 miles. His other contributions to the war effort included volunteering at the Stage Door Canteen and fundraising activities.      In 1959, he was accorded the honor of reading the Gettysburg Address to a joint session of Congress on the 150th anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln.      In 1962, President John F. Kennedy called on him to do a dramatic reading at a White House dinner, and ""at home"" for 30 past Nobel Prize winners.      In 1965, both Marches got recruited by the State Department to tour eight Near Eastern countries, presenting recitations of poetry and excerpts from plays in which they had appeared in the American theater. They were the first husband-and-wife acting team to go abroad under the auspices of the State Department\'s division of cultural presentations.      In 1975, Marjorie Main, Larry Parks and Richard Conte died within days of March. March died on April 14, 1975, and was cremated and buried under a favorite tree on his farm in Connecticut.      In 1947, the highest awards for giving the best performances of the year in two distinct mediums went to the same actor - Fredric March. An Oscar for The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) and a Tony for ""Years Ago"".      His performance in the title role in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) was an inspiration for the Marvel comics character Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk.      After 1958, he worked mostly on stage.      He was of English, German and Scottish heritage.      March turned own the role of Willie Loman in the original theatrical version of ""Death of a Salesman"" although he did do the film adaptation.Personal Quotes (10)      Keep interested in others; keep interested in the wide and wonderful world. Then in a spiritual sense, you will always be young.      I liked the name Frederick Bickel and I wish now I had left it as it was. After all, Theodore Bikel, whose name was similar though spelled differently, didn\'t change his, and he did all right.      Co-starring with Greta Garbo hardly constituted an introduction.      [commenting on the fact that he and Wallace Beery, who both won Best Actor Oscars for 1931-32 due to a tie, had recently adopted children] It seems a little odd that we were both given awards for the best male performance of the year.      Stardom is just an uneasy seat on top of a tricky toboggan. Being a star is merely perching at the head of the downgrade. A competent featured player can last a lifetime. A star, a year or two. There\'s all that agony of finding suitable stories, keeping in character, maintaining illusion. Then the undignified position of hanging on while your popularity is declining.      I have earnestly endeavored to perform my own share without fuss or temperament. An actor has no more right to be temperamental than a bank clerk. Possibly, a very sane bringing up as a child has helped me to retain my sense of proportion in these matters.      [on Joan Crawford] She was a nice person, but a real movie star. She even brought her own music to the set [of Susan and God (1940)] - a whole entourage, a violinist and a pianist to play her favorite songs, to get her into the proper mood for the scenes.      Actually, I was not overwhelmed by Greta Garbo\'s beauty. I think at that time women were more attracted to her than men.      (on receiving a kiss from Audrey Hepburn after her Oscar win in 1954) I\'ll take a dozen of those.      (when asked how he prepared for a role) I think it\'s almost physically impossible to give a well-rounded performance without knowing it beforehand. To try and rehearse eight hours a day and then go home at night and knock more lines into your head - it just doesn\'t work.

His maternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants, while his father was descended from a brother of frontiersmen Daniel Boone and Squire Boone.Richard was a college student, boxer, painter and oil-field laborer before ending up in the U.S. Navy during World War II. After the war he used the G.I. Bill to study acting with the Actor\'s Studio in New York. Serious and methodical, Boone debuted on Broadway in the play ""Medea"". Other plays followed, as did occasional TV work. In 1950 20th Century-Fox signed him to a contract and he made his screen debut in Halls of Montezuma (1951), playing a Marine officer. Tall and craggy, Boone was continually cast in a number of war and western movies. He also tackled roles such as Pontius Pilate in The Robe (1953) and a police detective in Vicki (1953). In 1954 he was cast as Dr. Konrad Styner in the pioneering medical series Medic (1954), which was a critical but not a ratings success. This role lasted for two years, but in the meantime, he continued to appear in westerns and war movies.In 1957 he played Dr. Wright, who treats Elizabeth for her memory lapses, in Lizzie (1957). It was also in that year that Boone was cast in what is his best-known role, the cultured gunfighter Paladin in the highly regarded western series Have Gun - Will Travel (1957). Although a gun for hire, Paladin was usually a moral one, did the job and lived at the Hotel Carlton in San Francisco. Immensely popular, the show made Boone a star. The series lasted six years, and in addition to starring in it, Boone also directed some episodes. He still kept busy on the big screen during the series\' run, appearing as Sam Houston in the John Wayne epic The Alamo (1960), and as a weary cavalry captain fighting Indians in A Thunder of Drums (1961). After Have Gun - Will Travel (1957) ended in 1963, Boone hosted a dramatic anthology series, The Richard Boone Show (1963), but it was not successful.Boone moved to Hawaii for the next seven years. During this time he made a few Westerns, including the muscular Rio Conchos (1964), but he was largely absent from the screen. In the 1970s he moved to Florida, and resumed his film and TV career with a vengeance. In 1972 he again appeared on television in the Jack Webb-produced series Hec Ramsey (1972) (years before he had played a police captain in Webb\'s first ""Dragnet"" film, Dragnet (1954)). Based on a real man, Hec was a tough, grizzled old frontier sheriff at the turn of the 20th century who, late in life, has studied the newest scientific theories of crime detection. His new boss, a much younger man, doesn\'t always approve of Hec, his nonconformist style or his new methods. The series lasted for two years. Boone continued working until the end of the decade but died from throat cancer in 1981.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Tony Fontana          Spouse (3)               Claire McAloon          (27 April\xa01951            - 10 January\xa01981)\xa0(his death)\xa0(1 child)                         Mimi Kelly          (1949            - 1950)\xa0(divorced)                         Jane H.

On a December 14, 1957, episode of Have Gun - Will Travel (1957), Boone found himself stripped to the waist by Apaches and bound spreadagle-style between four stakes driven into the ground. So vivid was this scene that leading men in other TV westerns soon found themselves in similar circumstances, most notably Robert Horton in Wagon Train (1957) Ralph Taeger in Hondo (1967) and Peter Brown and William Smith in Laredo (1965).      He directed the final scenes of The Night of the Following Day (1969) at the insistence of star Marlon Brando, as Brando could no longer tolerate what he considered the incompetence of director Hubert Cornfield. The film is generally considered the nadir of Brando\'s career, though it didn\'t hurt Boone, who was cast as the heavy.      According to Joseph McBride\'s ""Searching for John Ford"" (St. Martin\'s Press, 2001 - ISBN 0312242328), director John Ford was urged to cast Boone and Anthony Quinn as the Little Wolf and Dull Knife characters in Cheyenne Autumn (1964), as both had Native American blood. Ricardo Montalban and Gilbert Roland, who were of Mexican descent, were cast instead.      At the end of his life, he taught acting classes at Flagler College in St. Augustine, FL.      In the last year of his life he was appointed Florida\'s cultural ambassador.      Turned down Jack Lord\'s role in Hawaii Five-O (1968).      Enjoyed weightlifting.      Turned down Robert Shaw\'s role in The Sting (1973).      His great-great-great-great-grandfather, George Boone, was a brother of pioneers Daniel Boone and Squire Boone.      He is a sixth cousin of singer and actor Pat Boone (Richard\'s five times great-grandparents, Squire Boone and Sarah Morgan, were also Pat Boone\'s five time great-grandparents).      Taught acting classes at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City from 1974-75. He was temporarily replacing Sanford Meisner, who had become stricken with throat cancer.      Served in the US Navy during World War II.      He was cast in the role of ""Old Lodge Skins"" in Little Big Man (1970), but a real Native American, Chief Dan George, ended up playing the part.      Richard\'s only child, Peter Boone, from his third wife, Claire McAloon, is named after Richard\'s great-great grandfather.      He was an auto-racing fan.      His father was of English, Scottish, German, and Welsh descent, and his maternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants. Richard was very proud of his Jewish heritage, and starred in the first western to be filmed in Israel, Madron (1970). He received an award from Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1979 for his contribution to Israeli cinema.      He was a chain smoker.      His height was sometimes given as 6\'2"", although he himself gave his height as 6\'0"".      Struggled with alcoholism for most of his life, allegedly partly due to his experiences in World War II.      In her 2004 autobiography ""\'Tis Herself"", \'Maureen O\'Hara\' wrote that Boone and Peter Lawford, while filming Kangaroo (1952) in Melbourne, Australia, were arrested in a gay brothel ""full of beautiful boys"", but the studio prevented this from being reported by the press.      Richard Boone was married to Jane Hopper of Sausalito, CA, for a while in the 1940\'s in San Francisco where they both studied art and drama at the California Art Institute. They were best friends, drinkers both, but the marriage wasn\'t working so they split up and divorced. In 1945, Jane became pregnant from an affair with Richard Stiegler !! of Connecticut, a recently discharged naval captain, and even though she and Richard had separated, he nevertheless saw Jane through her pregnancy and the birth of a baby girl on June 17, 1946. The baby was given the name, ""Melissa Boone"" at birth but because it was hard at that time for an unmarried woman to have a child, the baby girl was put up for adoption and consequently adopted by Dr. and Mrs. Douglas G. Campbell of San Francisco who renamed her ""Gail Russell Campbell"". Jane\'s family tells of much craziness in her and Richard\'s relationship, including an instance when Richard was practicing sword fighting for a drama class and while waving his sword around, accidentally cut himself substantially in the thigh. Gail R. Campbell, 69, resides in Eugene, Oregon.      His later career was seriously affected by his chronic alcoholism. He walked off the set of Diamante Lobo (1976) before he had recorded his dialog. As a result his voice in the film had to be dubbed by someone else.      Before the United States entered World War II he had intended to be a painter.      He was sought to run for political office by the Republicans but declined.Personal Quotes (4)      [about John Wayne] He was an heroic figure and a hero. He stood up for causes when they weren\'t popular at all and he never hesitated to stand up and get counted, he was that kind of a person.

If you have the strength to do that, you\'re in pretty good shape.      Have I changed? Maybe success was necessary for me. I believe that unless I achieved it I would be a pretty miserable beast. Maybe I am a miserable beast. But now that I\'ve got success, in some measure, I can decide what I want - and what I want, in a word, is to do the best work I can under the best possible conditions.

There has been no tougher or more formidable Western heavy than Richard
Boone... He was a fine, respected actor and powerful presence, one of
the screen's most efficient scene-stealer...<br><br>In 'The Tall T,' Boone was Randolph Scott's intelligent, embittered
adversary, smooth as a rattlesnake and twice as treacherous; in 'Man
Without a Star,' he wrapped non-conforming farmers in barbed wire; in
'Way of a Gaucho,' he was a mean, sadistic Major who persecuted Rory
Calhoun; and in 'Hombre' he gave Paul Newman a rough ride: 'Well, now,
what do you suppose hell is gonna look like?' <br><br>Not many of the serious Westerns of the late sixties can match the mood
and authenticity of Martin Ritt's 'Hombre.' It is a suspenseful Western
melodrama pointing up racial bias and hypocrisy, with a plot modeled on
greed, nobility, prejudice and resignation...<br><br>John Russell (Paul Newman) has no emotion (except anger) and little
vitality; he's totally alienated from mankind and is 'alienating' as
well Russell is a white man raised by the Indians, who call him
""Hombre,"" and with whom he identifies<br><br>Choosing to isolate himself from white society, which he despises, he
lives on a reservation and looks and dresses like an Indian But he's
persuaded to cut his hair and return to civilization to take over some
property He winds up on a stagecoach with white passengers, who,
learning his background, force him to ride with the driver Not quite
an Indian, and banished by whites, he's the classic outcast in no man's
land Ironically, Russell is the only one capable of rescuing the
passengers from bandits and guiding them back to civilization The
drama depends on whether he will accept responsibility for his fellow
man<br><br>""Hombre,"" which reunited Newman with the ""Hud"" team (director Ritt,
writers Ravetch and Frank, cinematographer Howe), resembles John Ford's
classic Western, ""Stagecoach"": several people, whose personal crises
are outlined, are thrown together, and their interactions provide a
social commentary on avarice, bigotry and responsibility But in Ford's
film, those deemed worthless by society reveal their inherent nobility,
and only one man, the absconding banker, is bad Here, the embezzler of
Indian fundsFavor (Fredric March), is not much worse than the others
Except for Jessie (Diane Cilento), an honest, earthy woman in the
Patricia Neal-Hud vein, they're all helpless, coward1y or selfish<br><br>In this context, Russell is an inversion of the John Wayne hero He's
strong and silent in the traditional manner, but instead of being the
expected virile defender of the weak, he helps the others only when his
own survival is at stake He refuses to intercede when the malevolent
bandit Grimes (Richard Boone) deprives a soldier of his seat; is
willing to leave the helpless passengers stranded; indifferently sends
Favor out into the desert without water; and declines to rescue Favor's
Indian-hating wife (Barbara Rush), left by the bandits to bake in the
sun<br><br>Even though he acts out of a justifiable outrage, Russell is not meant
to be a sympathetic character: the white man's mistreatment may have
made him indifferently cruel, but cruel he is, nevertheless... Perhaps
to soften our attitude, the filmmakers have him suddenly abandon his
disengagement at the end, and perform the traditional act to rescue
Favor's wife<br><br>Newman's performance here is unlike any of his others His style has
been stripped away to the bare essentials; to call it underplaying
would be an understatement He imparts a sense of transcendent
stillness; when he acts he does so suddenly, returning immediately
thereafter to his relatively immobile state He speaks laconically, in
clipped sentences, with a solemn, deliberately monotonous, almost
lifeless voice In addition, his facial expression hard1y changes; at
times it approaches an infinitesimal smile, but otherwise it is
unsociable, severe, bitter, or inscrutably neutral<br><br>At first glance, it seems that Newman is hard1y acting, and some
critics called him wooden Russell's inscrutable expression is a mask
to cover his ingrained hurt, and suggests a man in a constant state of
meditation or deep reflection on the chaos around him Appropriately,
the film opens and closes on close-ups of his face, and throughout, our
attention is directed toward the blue eyes, which are constantly
watching, thinking, judging, condemning<br><br>Newman also frequently folds his arms as if protecting or insulating
himself from the worlda natural defense mechanism of someone who's
suffered a great deal of pain, and a physical equivalent of his
psychological introversion This is Newman's most completely
self-sufficient, isolated, and inhuman loner, and he gives a
performance that bravely risks complete alienation of the audience And
that's what happens; as in ""Torn Curtain,"" the character is ultimately
non-involving But it's an extremely interesting piece of disciplined
acting<br><br>Martin Ritt puts the whole picture together in a straight, precise
layout of plots, accumulating action that holds interest up to the big
scenes... Of all the sequences which stay in the mind, perhaps the most
memorable is that in which the Mexican bandit (Frank Silvera) painfully
congratulates Russell as a sharp shooter: 'Hey, Hombre! A compliment on
your shooting. You put a hole in me.'

""NOW I OWE YOU!.......YOU PUT TWO HOLES IN ME""!<br><br>20 Century Fox's HOMBRE is an excellent and engaging western! Although
somewhat unappreciated when it was first released in 1967 it has since
gained cult status and is now recognized as a splendid example of the
genre. Like the brilliant ""The Stalking Moon"" made the following year
HOMBRE initially suffered from the drop in appeal of westerns with the
general public that occurred in the sixties. But now with the
production of the western all but extinct and western fans yearning for
it to make a meaningful return (sans inane revisionist remakes like the
awful ""3 Ten To Yuma"") - Hollywood's past efforts at producing them in
the forties, fifties and sixties have gained considerable popularity
with a younger generation. This has resulted in the works of John Ford,
Raoul Walsh, Anthony Mann, Delmer Daves, Budd Boetticher and Henry
Hathaway becoming just about as popular today as they were all those
years ago. <br><br>From a fine novel by Elmore Leonard HOMBRE was brilliantly written for
the screen by Irving Ravitch and Harriet Frank. Produced by Ravitch and
Martin Ritt it was beautifully photographed in Panavision and Deluxe
colour in the mountains of Arizona by veteran genius cinematographer
James Wong Howe (""King's Row""/""Body &amp; Soul"") and was masterfully
directed by the underrated Martin Ritt.<br><br>Paul Newman is John Russell - a white man raised by the Apaches. He is
a discriminated passenger on a Stagecoach occupied by an array of
quirkish characters. Jesse (Diane Cilento) is on her way to Bisby to
start a new life after her marriage proposal is turned down by (about
to go bad) Sheriff Frank Braden (Cameron Mitchell) (""I don't want a
wife Jesse...I want out!""). There's Dr. Favor (the always wonderful
Fredric March) as the Indian Agent who has just embezzled the Indian
funds from the reservation accompanied by his beautiful and pert wife
(the lovely Barbara Rush). And Cicero Grimes (Richard Boone) who
intends to hold up the Stage and with his waiting gang make off with
the Indian funds. But after a series of events in which Russell kills
some of the gang and retrieves the money it falls to him to lead the
hapless passengers all the way back to town on foot. They take refuge
in an abandoned mine-works fending off Grimes and his men until finally
Russell confronts Grimes face to face and his Mexican gunman (Frank
Silvero). ""that Vaquero is more than a fair hand with a gun"" Grimes
warns Russell followed by what is a climactic but ultimately tragic
fast draw shootout.<br><br>Performances are quite exceptional from the entire cast! Newman is
terrific in what is one of his best ever roles. It is certainly the
best western part he played. Terrific too is veteran Fredric March in
what would be his third and final film. The rarely seen Diane Cilento
(Mrs. Sean Connery at one time) is superb in the female lead and never
better is Martin Balsam as the Stage driver. But the acting honours has
to go to Richard Boone as the baddie with the cracker of a name Cicero
Grimes. His role not terribly unlike that which he played ten years
previously in the Randolph Scott classic ""The Tall T"". And lest we
forget the effective brooding score contributed by composer David Rose
which lends a melancholy and reflective quality to this memorable and
outstanding western.<br><br>Classic line from HOMBRE....... When Grimes sees he has been duped by

This brutal western is easily one of Paul Newman's best performances,
hearkening back to ""HUD"" in its power and forthright honesty. Newman
plays a white man raised by Apaches on the reservation in Arizona who
grew up to become a member of the Indian police. His real father has
died and he cuts his long hair and goes down to the town to claim his
inheritance, a boarding house which he intends to sell ""for a herd of
horses down in Contention."" The residents of the building, including
the attractive female manager, are thus made to leave and he
accompanies them on their stage coach journey down to Bisbee. They are
joined by the Indian agent, skillfully played by Frederic March, his
snooty, sheltered wife, and a sinister stranger, wonderfully acted by
Richard Boone at his most gritty and threatening.<br><br>The characters in this movie, regardless of their importance, are
fleshed out convincingly. The writing is spare and fraught with
meaning, in fact, it is almost too perfect. No words are wasted and no
act appears frivolous. Newman plays the quintessential stoic, an Indian
mystic who rises above the circumstances of his harsh existence out of
sheer detachment. He accepts the brutality of the world at face value
and harbors absolutely no illusions. He doesn't stick his neck out like
some damn fool in order to impress anybody and he survives because he
deals with what comes his way, yet refuses to be affected by it, no
matter how tough things get. Just to watch his very convincing
interpretation of this sort of person is rewarding enough, but that is
only one of the roles so well evoked in this excellent drama. Richard
Boone has some of the great lines, such as, ""Mr., you've got some
mighty hard bark on you coming down here like this,"" followed by, ""Well
now, what do you suppose HELL is gonna look like?"" Frederic March hands
in a good performance as the crooked Indian agent, a role quite unlike
his great offerings in earlier films such as ""Man in the Gray Flannel
Suit"" or ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" ""Hombre"" is first-rate movie
fare, an entertaining, action-filled story brimming with conflict. As
art, it is right up there with the best films ever made, a
philosophical masterpiece.

Superbly written and acted, Hombre is one of the two or three best
end-of-the-West Westerns ever made.<br><br>Based on the Elmore Leonard novel and starring Paul Newman, Hombre is the
story of John Russell, a white man raised by Apaches forced by circumstances
to be responsible for the lives of a group of people who despise
him.<br><br>Dr. Faver: You've learned something about white people. They stick
together.
John Russell:  They better.<br><br>Newman is sterling as Russell, whose sense of honor puts him into a no-win
situation, and whose tenacity will not allow him to back off.  Richard Boone
was rarely better than as Cicero Grimes, who matches Russell, steely-eyed
glare for steely-eyed glare.  His performance here is on par with his
portrayal of gang-leader John Fain in Big Jake, just a few years
later.<br><br>Grimes: Well, now. Now what do you suppose hell is gonna look
like?
Russell:  We all die.  It's just a question of when.<br><br>Also outstanding are Diane Cilento, Barbara Rush, and Martin Balsam. A
strong performance by character actor Frank Silvera as an unnamed Mexican
bandit is one of the film's many gems.<br><br>Russell: (after wounding the Bandit)I would have done better, but I think
you moved.
Bandit: You can be sure I moved!<br><br>The magnificently desolate northern Arizona desert becomes an additional
character in the film.<br><br>If you are looking for the ultimate tough-guy film, you need look no further

Is this movie not a micro-view of society?  We have a certain class
structure.  We have heroes and villains.  We have one man, who, perhaps by
virtue of his Apache affinity, is essentially ""at one"" with himself.  He
tells the person who comments that they had mistakenly believed that he was
taking the money for himself, ""What you think is your business.""  He is
unaffected.  He knows who he is, what he's about, and is not ""on the string,""
dancing to the tune that others would call for him.  He has his own code;
his own values, and he demonstrates them -- in action -- throughout this
fine film.  Richard Boone is great as Grimes, and the overall cast is very
good.  This movie, in some ways, could be taken apart, viewed, and reviewed
much the same way as Henry Fonda's ""12 Angry Men.""  There is much to admire
about this movie . . . much to admire in the character, John Russell.

Outstanding direction, writing, acting, and cinematography make this film
perhaps the best western ever made, and certainly outstanding in it's
genre.
The good guys aren't all that good, and the bad guys are despicable.  The
dialogue is from Elmore Leonard, and is some of the best dialogue ever
written, western or not.  Example:  Early in the film Diane Cilento has
retreated to the privacy of a shack to remove her petticoat because of the
heat.  Paul Newman is in the room, and watches her silently as she bears
her
legs.  Then he says, ""You'd better stop right there lady, or I'm gonna
know
all there is to know about you.""  Ms Cilento's character Jessie (a hard
frontier woman who runs a boarding house and sleeps with the town sheriff)
retorts, ""You might have cleared your throat.""  Newman says, ""I couldn't,
my
heart was in it.""  The minor part cast is also outstanding:  Martin
Balsam,
Richard Boone, Cameron Mitchell, David Canary.  I also mention the
cinematographer, often overlooked, because it was James Wong Howe (Molly
McGuires, This Property is Condemned, Hud, Fantasia) who was one of the
greatest cinematographers that has ever lived.

Paul Newman did a whole bunch of films with Director Martin Ritt and
Hombre, one lean and mean western ranks as one of the best.<br><br>Newman is John Russell, the ultimate in the Stockholm Syndrome in the
western film. He's a man who was kidnapped by the Apaches as a child,
raised among them, and then when he was rescued from the Apaches,
turned his back on his rescuers and went back to live among them. The
opening of the film has some closeup shots of Newman as an Apache and
he does look like a figure of interest with those baby blue eyes of
his. The viewer is already involved, this is a person of interest,
there's a story here, let's find out about him.<br><br>Circumstance has put him on a coach with several other passengers,
including the Indian agent at the San Carlos Reservation, Fredric March
and his wife Barbara Rush. Unbeknownst to everyone else, March has
embezzled a whole stash of money from the tribe and is on the run, like
Berton Churchill in Stagecoach. Of course Churchill is not taking his
young pretty wife along with him.<br><br>The outlaws led by Richard Boone know about the loot and they ambush
the coach, but the holdup is unsuccessful. Nevertheless the passengers
are left afoot with the loot, but limited water on the Arizona desert.<br><br>It falls to Newman to lead them to safety, a guy they had previously
snubbed. Hombre gets deliciously ironic that way.<br><br>Next to Newman, I'd say the best performance in the film is easily that
of Diane Cilento, the very wise and earthy boarding house keeper. She's
one experienced with life woman who if everyone heeded it would have
been better all around.<br><br>Why are they with Newman, cause he can cut it. And as a film, Hombre
definitely cuts it.

This was a great production, with a fantastic cast, unforgettable
script and an excellent director and cinematographer. My hat goes off
to Paul Newman for taking a role that goes against his normally
expected ""cutesy"" performances and portraying a character we all wish
we could be more like. I will also applaud the performances of Diane
Cilento, Frederick March, and Richard Boone. You all ""can cut it"".<br><br>When ""Hombre"" was released, it received mixed reviews especially in the
foreign markets. I really have a hard time believing this considering
it's competition. I love a good western and I have always had a problem
with foreign made ""spahgetti westerns"" and never understood the
popularity of ""Fistful of Dollars"" or ""The Good, Bad and the Ugly"". Not
taking anything away from Clint Eastwood (because his presence was the
only thing that saved those films), but there was no credible dialog or
memorable cliché's to ever make me want to watch them more than once.<br><br>In my mind this has to be one of the top five westerns ever made and
ranks up there with ""High Noon"" or ""Stagecoach"". It always amazes me
that people can criticize the performance of Paul Newman. I have a hard
time envisioning anyone else that could have delivered as good a
performance. (Possibly Gary Cooper} Newman has made many great films
and just because he is so handsome, we have a hard time relating to him
as the cold, unpretentious, supporter of the weak as was John Russell.

<br><br>Hombre!   As I sat lazily on the couch, surfing the 999 Direct TV
channels
for something, ANYTHING, that might possibly be nonSalsa, nonSpike and
nonStupid [I know, I know, the odds were decidedly against me], I ran
across
this gem of a movie that I had not thought about for years, even decades!
Hombre?  HELL YES!!  Even with the annoying commercial breaks I
thoroughly
enjoyed watching this 36 year old  western, where less is MORE when you
have
top talents like Paul Newman and Richard Boone.  How many of you kiddies
out
there remember Have Gun Will Travel?  I didn't think so.....<br><br>MOVIE  9.5/10.0 Paul Newman &amp; Richard Boone, what can I
say?
Hombre is an end of an era western with a subtle political message about
discrimination. Instead of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, this movie
might
have been characterized as The Good, The Bad and the Wimpy.  The
supporting
actors and actresses play their roles splendidly, portraying human
weakness,
fear, greed, hubris, inexperience, and frailty, complementing Paul Newman
as
the stoic, low keyed, brooding but intensely powerful Hombre.  This was a
low budget movie and the script is a little weak at times, but the power
of
Neuman and Richard Boone overwhelm any weaknesses to make this one of the
best westerns ever.  Johnny Russell shows all, good and bad, especially
those who looked at him initially with disdain, just what character,
principle and courage are all about.<br><br>BADASSCISSITY 20.0/10.0 or maybe a lot more<br><br>From the opening scene in the bar, where John Russell disciplines a
range
bum who is disrespecting two Indians, the tempo of badasscissity is set.
Harelip time! This classic western is all about badasses and wimps and
provides a stark contrast in the individuals who ""can cut it"" and those
who
show their inexperience and lack of backbone.  Richard Boone is simply
fantastic as the tough, craggy, foul-mouthed Cicero Grimes, a bad man
with a
knack for intimidating ALMOST everyone in a dark, hostile and very
calculated manner.  He is so tough that even when crossing a desolate
desert, he takes only whiskey, no water.  ALL RIGHT!  Paul Newman plays a
tight-lipped, stoic, blue-eyed Indian who is not to be messed with, even
by
the smarmy Grimes.  Johnny Russell is as ice cold as the other side of
the
pillow, a tremendous acting effort, just what you would expect from a
Paul
Neuman.  Frank Silvera is the Mexican bandit who in spite of being gut
shot
by Russell,  laughs it off and gains much respect for the Hombre
adversary.<br><br>ONE LINERS  one million/10.0 Never has one man said so much by uttering
so
little<br><br>Hombre has to rank up there with some of the Clint Eastwood and
Schwarzenegger movies with one-liners. Awesome!  Here are just a
few....<br><br>John Russell:  Eaten one and lived like one.  [Referring to Indians

dogs]<br><br>Grimes:  You're coming one way or the other... You're coming..<br><br>John Russell: Because I can cut it, lady.<br><br>John Russell:  Try not to puke, you may have to lie in it for a while.
[Talking to the inept Mendez]<br><br>Mexican Bandit: Hey, Hombre.. A compliment on your shooting.. You put a
hole
in Me..'

John Russell: It only takes one who doesn't.<br><br>John Russell: You want a lot more than that from me, lady.
Grimes: Mister, you have got a lot of hard bark on you comin' down here
like
this.
Now, you put two holes in me and I owe you.
John Russell: Two's usually enough for most.
Grimes: Did you bring the money?
John Russell: Guess I brought my dirty laundry by mistake.<br><br>Grimes: Now what do your suppose hell is gonna look like.<br><br>John Russell: We all gotta die, it's only a matter of when.<br><br>...And perhaps one of the best one liners in a western
ever...
""How are you planning to get back down that hill?'   Hell
Yes!!!<br><br>[in context]
John Russell: Hey. I got a question. How are you planning to get back
down
that hill?
[Russell shoots the hell out of Grimes all the way down the hill as he
tumbles head over heals among the rocks....]  Did I say `Hell
Yes?
Jessie: [As Grimes crawls away after being shot] Cicero Grimes, meet John
Russell.<br><br>SAPPINESS  1.0/10.0 Very little here<br><br>There is wimpiness, but not much sappiness in this movie.  Three
distinctly
different women characters are portrayed as the naive, the seasoned and
the
sanctimonious, but there is hard hitting action and drama rather than
gooiness.  John Russell and the 'wedded, bedded &amp; loved &amp; let down'
Jessie
entertain a good-natured, succinct battle of the sexes, but no love here,
only genuine respect, especially at the conclusion of this drama.  Jessie
is
the only one of the motley passenger crew that shows backbone, the kind
of
woman that you  definitely want on your side.<br><br>~SPOILERS~<br><br>Paul Newman plays it cold as ice all the way through.   The scene at the
bar
was absolutely awesome, I always feel like jumping up and cheering for
the
Indians when Russell makes the loose-lipped cowboy eat the shot glass.
HELL
YES!<br><br>Richard Boone as Grimes just has a bad attitude from hell as he shows
right
off the bat in the stagecoach station.  He intimidates and bullies
everyone
with a cold and calculated ferocity that is so believable that it invokes
anger every time I see it.
Johnny Russell shows mettle like a combat hardened veteran as he calmly
hops
up on the top of the stagecoach and methodically blows away the
harelipped
cowboy and the sheriff gone bad, immediately assuming the role of leader
of
the stranded group of passengers. No fluff, just a masterpiece of a
scene.
The final shootout scene was also a masterpiece as it invokes tremendous
courage and character along with irony and frustration. The frustration
was
that the most courageous character and all of the badasses died in a
blaze
of battle as the others survived, in spite of their human frailty.  The
obstruction of the line of site by the rescued Audra Favor was an
especially
ironic twist, but Russell was still able to dispatch Grimes and the
Bandit,
but at the cost of his own life. Grimes' line 'Now what do your suppose
hell
is gonna look like?' was brilliant and chilling, extending the continuity
of
the dark personality of this disturbing character.<br><br>A must watch!  A classic!  How are you going to get down that hill unless
you watch this movie right now?<br><br>SS

There are so many rave comments here about Hombre I won't repeat them. I'll
just say this is my favorite Paul Newman movie of them all, and one of the
best Western's ever made. Richard Boone is terrific as the villain.
Newman's
low-key performance is remarkably powerful and authoritative. Great cast,
story, mood, with an almost Zen like quality in the unfolding and
resolution. Hombre has stayed with me for 33 years.

There has been no tougher or more formidable Western heavy than Richard
Boone... He was a fine, respected actor and powerful presence, one of
the screen's most efficient scene-stealer...<br><br>In 'The Tall T,' Boone was Randolph Scott's intelligent, embittered
adversary, smooth as a rattlesnake and twice as treacherous; in 'Man
Without a Star,' he wrapped non-conforming farmers in barbed wire; in
'Way of a Gaucho,' he was a mean, sadistic Major who persecuted Rory
Calhoun; and in 'Hombre' he gave Paul Newman a rough ride: 'Well, now,
what do you suppose hell is gonna look like?' <br><br>Not many of the serious Westerns of the late sixties can match the mood
and authenticity of Martin Ritt's 'Hombre.' It is a suspenseful Western
melodrama pointing up racial bias and hypocrisy, with a plot modeled on
greed, nobility, prejudice and resignation...<br><br>John Russell (Paul Newman) has no emotion (except anger) and little
vitality; he's totally alienated from mankind and is 'alienating' as
well Russell is a white man raised by the Indians, who call him
""Hombre,"" and with whom he identifies<br><br>Choosing to isolate himself from white society, which he despises, he
lives on a reservation and looks and dresses like an Indian But he's
persuaded to cut his hair and return to civilization to take over some
property He winds up on a stagecoach with white passengers, who,
learning his background, force him to ride with the driver Not quite
an Indian, and banished by whites, he's the classic outcast in no man's
land Ironically, Russell is the only one capable of rescuing the
passengers from bandits and guiding them back to civilization The
drama depends on whether he will accept responsibility for his fellow
man<br><br>""Hombre,"" which reunited Newman with the ""Hud"" team (director Ritt,
writers Ravetch and Frank, cinematographer Howe), resembles John Ford's
classic Western, ""Stagecoach"": several people, whose personal crises
are outlined, are thrown together, and their interactions provide a
social commentary on avarice, bigotry and responsibility But in Ford's
film, those deemed worthless by society reveal their inherent nobility,
and only one man, the absconding banker, is bad Here, the embezzler of
Indian fundsFavor (Fredric March), is not much worse than the others
Except for Jessie (Diane Cilento), an honest, earthy woman in the
Patricia Neal-Hud vein, they're all helpless, coward1y or selfish<br><br>In this context, Russell is an inversion of the John Wayne hero He's
strong and silent in the traditional manner, but instead of being the
expected virile defender of the weak, he helps the others only when his
own survival is at stake He refuses to intercede when the malevolent
bandit Grimes (Richard Boone) deprives a soldier of his seat; is
willing to leave the helpless passengers stranded; indifferently sends
Favor out into the desert without water; and declines to rescue Favor's
Indian-hating wife (Barbara Rush), left by the bandits to bake in the
sun<br><br>Even though he acts out of a justifiable outrage, Russell is not meant
to be a sympathetic character: the white man's mistreatment may have
made him indifferently cruel, but cruel he is, nevertheless... Perhaps
to soften our attitude, the filmmakers have him suddenly abandon his
disengagement at the end, and perform the traditional act to rescue
Favor's wife<br><br>Newman's performance here is unlike any of his others His style has
been stripped away to the bare essentials; to call it underplaying
would be an understatement He imparts a sense of transcendent
stillness; when he acts he does so suddenly, returning immediately
thereafter to his relatively immobile state He speaks laconically, in
clipped sentences, with a solemn, deliberately monotonous, almost
lifeless voice In addition, his facial expression hard1y changes; at
times it approaches an infinitesimal smile, but otherwise it is
unsociable, severe, bitter, or inscrutably neutral<br><br>At first glance, it seems that Newman is hard1y acting, and some
critics called him wooden Russell's inscrutable expression is a mask
to cover his ingrained hurt, and suggests a man in a constant state of
meditation or deep reflection on the chaos around him Appropriately,
the film opens and closes on close-ups of his face, and throughout, our
attention is directed toward the blue eyes, which are constantly
watching, thinking, judging, condemning<br><br>Newman also frequently folds his arms as if protecting or insulating
himself from the worlda natural defense mechanism of someone who's
suffered a great deal of pain, and a physical equivalent of his
psychological introversion This is Newman's most completely
self-sufficient, isolated, and inhuman loner, and he gives a
performance that bravely risks complete alienation of the audience And
that's what happens; as in ""Torn Curtain,"" the character is ultimately
non-involving But it's an extremely interesting piece of disciplined
acting<br><br>Martin Ritt puts the whole picture together in a straight, precise
layout of plots, accumulating action that holds interest up to the big
scenes... Of all the sequences which stay in the mind, perhaps the most
memorable is that in which the Mexican bandit (Frank Silvera) painfully
congratulates Russell as a sharp shooter: 'Hey, Hombre! A compliment on
your shooting. You put a hole in me.'

""NOW I OWE YOU!.......YOU PUT TWO HOLES IN ME""!<br><br>20 Century Fox's HOMBRE is an excellent and engaging western! Although
somewhat unappreciated when it was first released in 1967 it has since
gained cult status and is now recognized as a splendid example of the
genre. Like the brilliant ""The Stalking Moon"" made the following year
HOMBRE initially suffered from the drop in appeal of westerns with the
general public that occurred in the sixties. But now with the
production of the western all but extinct and western fans yearning for
it to make a meaningful return (sans inane revisionist remakes like the
awful ""3 Ten To Yuma"") - Hollywood's past efforts at producing them in
the forties, fifties and sixties have gained considerable popularity
with a younger generation. This has resulted in the works of John Ford,
Raoul Walsh, Anthony Mann, Delmer Daves, Budd Boetticher and Henry
Hathaway becoming just about as popular today as they were all those
years ago. <br><br>From a fine novel by Elmore Leonard HOMBRE was brilliantly written for
the screen by Irving Ravitch and Harriet Frank. Produced by Ravitch and
Martin Ritt it was beautifully photographed in Panavision and Deluxe
colour in the mountains of Arizona by veteran genius cinematographer
James Wong Howe (""King's Row""/""Body &amp; Soul"") and was masterfully
directed by the underrated Martin Ritt.<br><br>Paul Newman is John Russell - a white man raised by the Apaches. He is
a discriminated passenger on a Stagecoach occupied by an array of
quirkish characters. Jesse (Diane Cilento) is on her way to Bisby to
start a new life after her marriage proposal is turned down by (about
to go bad) Sheriff Frank Braden (Cameron Mitchell) (""I don't want a
wife Jesse...I want out!""). There's Dr. Favor (the always wonderful
Fredric March) as the Indian Agent who has just embezzled the Indian
funds from the reservation accompanied by his beautiful and pert wife
(the lovely Barbara Rush). And Cicero Grimes (Richard Boone) who
intends to hold up the Stage and with his waiting gang make off with
the Indian funds. But after a series of events in which Russell kills
some of the gang and retrieves the money it falls to him to lead the
hapless passengers all the way back to town on foot. They take refuge
in an abandoned mine-works fending off Grimes and his men until finally
Russell confronts Grimes face to face and his Mexican gunman (Frank
Silvero). ""that Vaquero is more than a fair hand with a gun"" Grimes
warns Russell followed by what is a climactic but ultimately tragic
fast draw shootout.<br><br>Performances are quite exceptional from the entire cast! Newman is
terrific in what is one of his best ever roles. It is certainly the
best western part he played. Terrific too is veteran Fredric March in
what would be his third and final film. The rarely seen Diane Cilento
(Mrs. Sean Connery at one time) is superb in the female lead and never
better is Martin Balsam as the Stage driver. But the acting honours has
to go to Richard Boone as the baddie with the cracker of a name Cicero
Grimes. His role not terribly unlike that which he played ten years
previously in the Randolph Scott classic ""The Tall T"". And lest we
forget the effective brooding score contributed by composer David Rose
which lends a melancholy and reflective quality to this memorable and
outstanding western.<br><br>Classic line from HOMBRE....... When Grimes sees he has been duped by

This brutal western is easily one of Paul Newman's best performances,
hearkening back to ""HUD"" in its power and forthright honesty. Newman
plays a white man raised by Apaches on the reservation in Arizona who
grew up to become a member of the Indian police. His real father has
died and he cuts his long hair and goes down to the town to claim his
inheritance, a boarding house which he intends to sell ""for a herd of
horses down in Contention."" The residents of the building, including
the attractive female manager, are thus made to leave and he
accompanies them on their stage coach journey down to Bisbee. They are
joined by the Indian agent, skillfully played by Frederic March, his
snooty, sheltered wife, and a sinister stranger, wonderfully acted by
Richard Boone at his most gritty and threatening.<br><br>The characters in this movie, regardless of their importance, are
fleshed out convincingly. The writing is spare and fraught with
meaning, in fact, it is almost too perfect. No words are wasted and no
act appears frivolous. Newman plays the quintessential stoic, an Indian
mystic who rises above the circumstances of his harsh existence out of
sheer detachment. He accepts the brutality of the world at face value
and harbors absolutely no illusions. He doesn't stick his neck out like
some damn fool in order to impress anybody and he survives because he
deals with what comes his way, yet refuses to be affected by it, no
matter how tough things get. Just to watch his very convincing
interpretation of this sort of person is rewarding enough, but that is
only one of the roles so well evoked in this excellent drama. Richard
Boone has some of the great lines, such as, ""Mr., you've got some
mighty hard bark on you coming down here like this,"" followed by, ""Well
now, what do you suppose HELL is gonna look like?"" Frederic March hands
in a good performance as the crooked Indian agent, a role quite unlike
his great offerings in earlier films such as ""Man in the Gray Flannel
Suit"" or ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" ""Hombre"" is first-rate movie
fare, an entertaining, action-filled story brimming with conflict. As
art, it is right up there with the best films ever made, a

structure.  We have heroes and villains.  We have one man, who, perhaps by
virtue of his Apache affinity, is essentially ""at one"" with himself.  He
tells the person who comments that they had mistakenly believed that he was
taking the money for himself, ""What you think is your business.""  He is
unaffected.  He knows who he is, what he's about, and is not ""on the string,""
dancing to the tune that others would call for him.  He has his own code;
his own values, and he demonstrates them -- in action -- throughout this
fine film.  Richard Boone is great as Grimes, and the overall cast is very
good.  This movie, in some ways, could be taken apart, viewed, and reviewed
much the same way as Henry Fonda's ""12 Angry Men.""  There is much to admire
about this movie . . . much to admire in the character, John Russell.

Outstanding direction, writing, acting, and cinematography make this film
perhaps the best western ever made, and certainly outstanding in it's
genre.
The good guys aren't all that good, and the bad guys are despicable.  The
dialogue is from Elmore Leonard, and is some of the best dialogue ever
written, western or not.  Example:  Early in the film Diane Cilento has
retreated to the privacy of a shack to remove her petticoat because of the
heat.  Paul Newman is in the room, and watches her silently as she bears
her
legs.  Then he says, ""You'd better stop right there lady, or I'm gonna
know
all there is to know about you.""  Ms Cilento's character Jessie (a hard
frontier woman who runs a boarding house and sleeps with the town sheriff)
retorts, ""You might have cleared your throat.""  Newman says, ""I couldn't,
my
heart was in it.""  The minor part cast is also outstanding:  Martin
Balsam,
Richard Boone, Cameron Mitchell, David Canary.  I also mention the
cinematographer, often overlooked, because it was James Wong Howe (Molly
McGuires, This Property is Condemned, Hud, Fantasia) who was one of the
greatest cinematographers that has ever lived.

Paul Newman did a whole bunch of films with Director Martin Ritt and
Hombre, one lean and mean western ranks as one of the best.<br><br>Newman is John Russell, the ultimate in the Stockholm Syndrome in the
western film. He's a man who was kidnapped by the Apaches as a child,
raised among them, and then when he was rescued from the Apaches,
turned his back on his rescuers and went back to live among them. The
opening of the film has some closeup shots of Newman as an Apache and
he does look like a figure of interest with those baby blue eyes of
his. The viewer is already involved, this is a person of interest,
there's a story here, let's find out about him.<br><br>Circumstance has put him on a coach with several other passengers,
including the Indian agent at the San Carlos Reservation, Fredric March
and his wife Barbara Rush. Unbeknownst to everyone else, March has
embezzled a whole stash of money from the tribe and is on the run, like
Berton Churchill in Stagecoach. Of course Churchill is not taking his
young pretty wife along with him.<br><br>The outlaws led by Richard Boone know about the loot and they ambush
the coach, but the holdup is unsuccessful. Nevertheless the passengers
are left afoot with the loot, but limited water on the Arizona desert.<br><br>It falls to Newman to lead them to safety, a guy they had previously
snubbed. Hombre gets deliciously ironic that way.<br><br>Next to Newman, I'd say the best performance in the film is easily that
of Diane Cilento, the very wise and earthy boarding house keeper. She's
one experienced with life woman who if everyone heeded it would have
been better all around.<br><br>Why are they with Newman, cause he can cut it. And as a film, Hombre
definitely cuts it.

This was a great production, with a fantastic cast, unforgettable
script and an excellent director and cinematographer. My hat goes off
to Paul Newman for taking a role that goes against his normally
expected ""cutesy"" performances and portraying a character we all wish
we could be more like. I will also applaud the performances of Diane
Cilento, Frederick March, and Richard Boone. You all ""can cut it"".<br><br>When ""Hombre"" was released, it received mixed reviews especially in the
foreign markets. I really have a hard time believing this considering
it's competition. I love a good western and I have always had a problem
with foreign made ""spahgetti westerns"" and never understood the
popularity of ""Fistful of Dollars"" or ""The Good, Bad and the Ugly"". Not
taking anything away from Clint Eastwood (because his presence was the
only thing that saved those films), but there was no credible dialog or
memorable cliché's to ever make me want to watch them more than once.<br><br>In my mind this has to be one of the top five westerns ever made and
ranks up there with ""High Noon"" or ""Stagecoach"". It always amazes me
that people can criticize the performance of Paul Newman. I have a hard
time envisioning anyone else that could have delivered as good a
performance. (Possibly Gary Cooper} Newman has made many great films
and just because he is so handsome, we have a hard time relating to him
as the cold, unpretentious, supporter of the weak as was John Russell.

<br><br>Hombre!   As I sat lazily on the couch, surfing the 999 Direct TV
channels
for something, ANYTHING, that might possibly be nonSalsa, nonSpike and
nonStupid [I know, I know, the odds were decidedly against me], I ran
across
this gem of a movie that I had not thought about for years, even decades!
Hombre?  HELL YES!!  Even with the annoying commercial breaks I
thoroughly
enjoyed watching this 36 year old  western, where less is MORE when you
have
top talents like Paul Newman and Richard Boone.  How many of you kiddies
out
there remember Have Gun Will Travel?  I didn't think so.....<br><br>MOVIE  9.5/10.0 Paul Newman &amp; Richard Boone, what can I
say?
Hombre is an end of an era western with a subtle political message about
discrimination. Instead of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, this movie
might
have been characterized as The Good, The Bad and the Wimpy.  The
supporting
actors and actresses play their roles splendidly, portraying human
weakness,
fear, greed, hubris, inexperience, and frailty, complementing Paul Newman
as
the stoic, low keyed, brooding but intensely powerful Hombre.  This was a
low budget movie and the script is a little weak at times, but the power
of
Neuman and Richard Boone overwhelm any weaknesses to make this one of the
best westerns ever.  Johnny Russell shows all, good and bad, especially
those who looked at him initially with disdain, just what character,
principle and courage are all about.<br><br>BADASSCISSITY 20.0/10.0 or maybe a lot more<br><br>From the opening scene in the bar, where John Russell disciplines a
range
bum who is disrespecting two Indians, the tempo of badasscissity is set.
Harelip time! This classic western is all about badasses and wimps and
provides a stark contrast in the individuals who ""can cut it"" and those
who
show their inexperience and lack of backbone.  Richard Boone is simply
fantastic as the tough, craggy, foul-mouthed Cicero Grimes, a bad man
with a
knack for intimidating ALMOST everyone in a dark, hostile and very
calculated manner.  He is so tough that even when crossing a desolate
desert, he takes only whiskey, no water.  ALL RIGHT!  Paul Newman plays a
tight-lipped, stoic, blue-eyed Indian who is not to be messed with, even
by
the smarmy Grimes.  Johnny Russell is as ice cold as the other side of
the
pillow, a tremendous acting effort, just what you would expect from a
Paul
Neuman.  Frank Silvera is the Mexican bandit who in spite of being gut
shot
by Russell,  laughs it off and gains much respect for the Hombre
adversary.<br><br>ONE LINERS  one million/10.0 Never has one man said so much by uttering
so
little<br><br>Hombre has to rank up there with some of the Clint Eastwood and
Schwarzenegger movies with one-liners. Awesome!  Here are just a
few....<br><br>John Russell:  Eaten one and lived like one.  [Referring to Indians
eating
dogs]<br><br>Grimes:  You're coming one way or the other... You're coming..<br><br>John Russell: Because I can cut it, lady.<br><br>John Russell:  Try not to puke, you may have to lie in it for a while.
[Talking to the inept Mendez]<br><br>Mexican Bandit: Hey, Hombre.. A compliment on your shooting.. You put a
hole
in Me..'
John Russell: I would have done better, but I think you

together.

John Russell: It only takes one who doesn't.<br><br>John Russell: You want a lot more than that from me, lady.
Grimes: Mister, you have got a lot of hard bark on you comin' down here
like
this.
Now, you put two holes in me and I owe you.
John Russell: Two's usually enough for most.
Grimes: Did you bring the money?
John Russell: Guess I brought my dirty laundry by mistake.<br><br>Grimes: Now what do your suppose hell is gonna look like.<br><br>John Russell: We all gotta die, it's only a matter of when.<br><br>...And perhaps one of the best one liners in a western
ever...
""How are you planning to get back down that hill?'   Hell
Yes!!!<br><br>[in context]
John Russell: Hey. I got a question. How are you planning to get back
down
that hill?
[Russell shoots the hell out of Grimes all the way down the hill as he
tumbles head over heals among the rocks....]  Did I say `Hell
Yes?
Jessie: [As Grimes crawls away after being shot] Cicero Grimes, meet John
Russell.<br><br>SAPPINESS  1.0/10.0 Very little here<br><br>There is wimpiness, but not much sappiness in this movie.  Three
distinctly
different women characters are portrayed as the naive, the seasoned and
the
sanctimonious, but there is hard hitting action and drama rather than
gooiness.  John Russell and the 'wedded, bedded &amp; loved &amp; let down'
Jessie
entertain a good-natured, succinct battle of the sexes, but no love here,
only genuine respect, especially at the conclusion of this drama.  Jessie
is
the only one of the motley passenger crew that shows backbone, the kind
of
woman that you  definitely want on your side.<br><br>~SPOILERS~<br><br>Paul Newman plays it cold as ice all the way through.   The scene at the
bar
was absolutely awesome, I always feel like jumping up and cheering for
the
Indians when Russell makes the loose-lipped cowboy eat the shot glass.
HELL
YES!<br><br>Richard Boone as Grimes just has a bad attitude from hell as he shows
right
off the bat in the stagecoach station.  He intimidates and bullies
everyone
with a cold and calculated ferocity that is so believable that it invokes
anger every time I see it.
Johnny Russell shows mettle like a combat hardened veteran as he calmly
hops
up on the top of the stagecoach and methodically blows away the
harelipped
cowboy and the sheriff gone bad, immediately assuming the role of leader
of
the stranded group of passengers. No fluff, just a masterpiece of a
scene.
The final shootout scene was also a masterpiece as it invokes tremendous
courage and character along with irony and frustration. The frustration
was
that the most courageous character and all of the badasses died in a
blaze
of battle as the others survived, in spite of their human frailty.  The
obstruction of the line of site by the rescued Audra Favor was an
especially
ironic twist, but Russell was still able to dispatch Grimes and the
Bandit,
but at the cost of his own life. Grimes' line 'Now what do your suppose
hell
is gonna look like?' was brilliant and chilling, extending the continuity
of
the dark personality of this disturbing character.<br><br>A must watch!  A classic!  How are you going to get down that hill unless
you watch this movie right now?<br><br>SS

There are so many rave comments here about Hombre I won't repeat them. I'll
just say this is my favorite Paul Newman movie of them all, and one of the
best Western's ever made. Richard Boone is terrific as the villain.
Newman's
low-key performance is remarkably powerful and authoritative. Great cast,
story, mood, with an almost Zen like quality in the unfolding and
resolution. Hombre has stayed with me for 33 years.

He was one of the last surviving members of a great generation of British actors, which included Sir Laurence Olivier, Sir John Gielgud and Sir Ralph Richardson.      ""de Cuffe"" is his mother\'s surname; he never knew the identity of his father (source: obituary, Daily Telegraph, 7 August 2000).      He was awarded the Companion of Honour in the 1994 Queen\'s Birthday Honours List for his services to drama.

He was a huge fan of the television series Due South (1994).      Despite popular belief, he never uttered the line ""May the force be with you"" in any of the Star Wars films (the closest he came was ""the force will be with you"").      He was voted third in the Orange Film 2001 survey of greatest British film actors.      The qualities he claimed to most admire in an actor were ""simplicity, purity, clarity of line"".

Guinness portrayed Adolf Hitler in Hitler: The Last Ten Days (1973). Robert Carlyle portrayed Adolf Hitler in Hitler: The Rise of Evil (2003), while Ewan McGregor succeeded him in the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi.Ewan McGregor was not the only actor in the Star Wars prequels to study his performances. The voice for the character Watto was modeled after Guinness\'s performance as Fagin in Oliver Twist (1948).      Though he often spoke critically of Star Wars, the three leads, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, have always spoken very fondly of him, praising him as being a very professional actor who was always respectful to the people he worked with.      Reportedly answered one Star Wars fan\'s boast that he had seen the first movie over a hundred times, with a nod and the words ""Promise me you\'ll never watch it again."". The boy was stunned, but his mother thanked Guinness.      His favourite hotel in London was the Connaught, in which he always stayed whenever visiting the city.      A heavy smoker for most of his life, he finally managed to give up the habit in his last years.      One of his last jobs was providing the voice (his first and only voice-over) for a cartoon character on a British television ad campaign by the Inland Revenue advising the public about the new tax return forms which were to be introduced. He said in his diary of the recording (made on March 30, 1995) ""I did it feebly."".George Lucas said Guinness was very patient and helpful to him during the filming of Star Wars (1977), even to the point of getting the other actors to work more seriously.Harrison Ford said that Guinness helped him find an apartment to stay at when he arrived in England to film Star Wars (1977).      Won Broadway\'s 1964 Tony Award as Best Actor (Dramatic) for ""Dylan"", in which he played the title character, poet Dylan Thomas.      Both he and his wife, Merula Salaman, converted to the Roman Catholic Church in the 1950s.      Following his death, he was interred at Petersfield Cemetery in Petersfield, Hampshire, England.      Had appeared with Kay Walsh in five films: Oliver Twist (1948), Last Holiday (1950), The Horse\'s Mouth (1958), Tunes of Glory (1960) and Scrooge (1970).      Despite being two of Britain\'s most distinguished actors of their generation, he appeared in only two films with John Mills: Great Expectations (1946) and Tunes of Glory (1960).      Celebrated his 62nd birthday during the filming of Star Wars (1977) in Tunisia, where the Tatooine scenes were filmed.      Was considered for the role of Hercule Poirot in Murder on the Orient Express (1974), which went to Albert Finney.      In certain prints of The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), a film in which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, his last name is misspelled ""Guiness"".      In his autobiographical volumes, Guinness wrote about an incident at the Old Vic when, in the company of National Theater (which originally played at the Old Vic) artistic director Laurence Olivier in the basement of the theater, he asked where a certain tunnel went. Olivier did not really know but confidently decided to take the tunnel as it must come out somewhere nearby, it being part of the Old Vic. In reality, the tunnel went under the Thames, and they were rescued after several hours of fruitless navigation of the dark, damp corridor. Guinness remarked that Olivier\'s willingness to plunge into the dark and unknown was characteristic of the type of person (and actor) he was. As for himself as an actor, Guinness lamented at times that he did not take enough chances.      Went bald on top, and according to his Time magazine cover story of April 21, 1958, he was embarrassed by it but chose not to wear a hairpiece in private life. He told the Time writer that he had shaved the top of his head as a young man in his first professional acting engagement, playing a coolie. It never grew back properly after that, he lamented.      Had played the Fool to Laurence Olivier\'s first King Lear under the direction of Tyrone Guthrie in 1946 when he was 31 and Olivier was 39. Olivier was generally considered less-than-successful in the part due to his youth and relative lack of maturity in classical parts (though his contemporaneous ""Henry V"" was a smash and hinted at his future greatness as an interpreter of William Shakespeare). However, Guinness received raves for his acting. Both actors went on to knighthoods and Best Actor Oscars in their long and distinguished careers.      Was the subject of a cover story in Time magazine for the week of April 21, 1958, shortly after he won the Best Actor Oscar for The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957).      In the last year of his life, Sir Alec had been receiving hospital treatment for failing eyesight due to glaucoma, and he had been diagnosed with inoperable prostate cancer in January 2000. By the time his liver cancer was discovered in July 2000, it was at an extremely advanced stage, making surgery impossible.      Had his first speaking role on the professional stage in the melodrama ""Queer Cargo"" (he did not appear in the film). At age 20, the tyro actor played a Chinese coolie in the first act, a French pirate in Act 2 and a British sailor in Act 3, a foreshadowing of the shapeshifting he would do in his cinema career, where he once played as many as eight roles in a single film (Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949)).      Is the only person to receive a best acting nomination in any of the Star Wars movies.      Contrary to popular rumors, he did not hate working on the Star Wars films. What he hated was the fact that many of the Star Wars fans would only ever remember him as Obi-Wan Kenobi despite all the success of his previous roles.      Guinness was a member of the Old Vic group organized by John Gielgud in the early 1930s, which also included, among others, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quayle and Peggy Ashcroft.      He was made a Fellow of the British Film Institute in recognition of his outstanding contribution to film culture.      Had played the role of Osric in John Gielgud\'s theatrical production of ""Hamlet"" in 1934. In Laurence Olivier\'s 1948 film version, this role was played by Peter Cushing, with whom Guinness appeared years later in Star Wars (1977). The film was also Cushing\'s first collaboration with future Star Wars cast member Christopher Lee.      While filming The Swan (1956) in Hollywood, he met James Dean, just days before the young actor\'s death. Sir Alec later recalled predicting that Dean would die in a car crash: when Dean showed Guinness his newly-bought Porsche, Guinness advised him to ""Get rid of that car, or you\'ll be dead in a week!"". Guinness unfortunately proved right.      According to playwright Neil Simon, Alec was reading the script for Star Wars (1977) while on set filming Murder by Death (1976) and commented that Star Wars may be a ""good one"".      Favorite actor of both David Lean and Ronald Neame. Had worked on many of both director\'s films.      During his service in the Royal Navy, he commanded a landing craft invading Sicily and Elba, and helped to supply soldiers in Yugoslavia.      Upon notification that he was to achieve a lifetime achievement Oscar, he was not keen but expressed thanks. He informed the Academy that there was no way he would even consider flying to California to pick up this award. Academy President Fay Kanin, asked Dustin Hoffman who was doing promotional work from Kramer vs. Kramer in London, to meet with Guinness and persuade him to attend. As both men had very similar attitudes to their past work, Guinness warmed up to the idea and agreed to attend.      Was considered by producer Hal B. Wallis for the lead role in Visit to a Small Planet (1960) at the same time with Danny Kaye and Jerry Lewis, the last one eventually getting the role.      Has appeared in several of David Lean\'s movies. In them, he has portrayed Englishmen, an Arab, a Russian and an Indian.      He preferred working on stage to appearing in films. He also preferred appearing in newer plays rather than the classics, so that his performance would not be compared to how previous actors had played the role.      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1559 Vine Street in Hollywood, California on February 8, 1960.      Though knighted, he did not like being referred to as Sir Alec Guinness.      His stepfather fought in the Anglo-Irish War.      At a young age, Guinness received acting lessons from Martita Hunt, who dismissed him after two lessons, telling him he would never be an actor although lessons were resumed at a later date.      After Guinness won a two year scholarship from a dramatic academy, John Gielgud, one of the competition judges, offered him a role in his production of ""Hamlet"" in 1934.      His experiences with the Royal Navy involved shipping supplies to Yugoslav partisans during World War II.      Great-grandfather of Natasha Guinness-Taylor and Otis Guinness-Walker.      Had appeared in two Best Picture Academy Award winners: The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962). Jack Hawkins also appeared in both films.      The 2003 book ""Alec Guinness: The Authorised Biography"" reprints several letters that Guinness wrote to his longtime friend and correspondent Anne Kaufman in which he expressed his displeasure with and dubiousness about the quality of Star Wars (1977) as it was in production. Before filming started, he wrote: ""I have been offered a movie (20th Century Fox) which I may accept, if they come up with proper money. London and North Africa, starting in mid-March. Science fiction--which gives me pause--but is to be directed by Paul [sic] Lucas who did American Graffiti, which makes me feel I should. Big part. Fairy-tale rubbish but could be interesting perhaps. Then after filming started, he wrote to Kaufman again to complain about the dialogue and describe his co-stars: new rubbish dialogue reaches me every other day on wadges of pink paper--and none of it makes my character clear or even bearable. I just think, thankfully, of the lovely bread, which will help me keep going until next April. I must off to studio and work with a dwarf (very sweet--and he has to wash in a bidet) and your fellow countrymen Mark Hamill and Tennyson (that can\'t be right) Ford. Ellison (?--No!)--well, a rangy, languid young man who is probably intelligent and amusing. But oh God, God, they make me feel ninety--and treat me as if I was 106. Oh, [the actor\'s name is] Harrison Ford--ever heard of him?"".      Although he played Christopher Plummer\'s father in The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964), he was only fifteen years his senior in real life.      His name is an anagram for ""genuine class"", a fact which was mentioned in The Simpsons: Lisa\'s Rival (1994).      Guinness had a 2.25% interest in the revenue from Star Wars (1977), which would be the highest grossing movie at the time (and second only to Gone with the Wind (1939) when adjusted for inflation). Guinness had agreed to a 2% interest to make the film, but he reported that just before release during a telephone conversation George Lucas had offered an additional 0.5% because of how supportive and helpful Guinness had been (with dialogue, other actors, etc.). After the release and stunning results at the box office, Guinness asked to confirm the additional 0.5% in writing, but was told it was (reduced to) 0.25%, although it is not clear who had decided this. This was revealed by Guinness in the 1977 interview with BBC\'s Michael Parkinson on the series ""Talking Pictures"". It was in general supported by many public comments by Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher all speaking highly of Guinness\' professionalism and impact on the set. Apparently, Guinness did not quibble the 1977 worldwide revenue for Star Wars of $400+ million making Guinness\' 2.25% probably around $9m for that year alone, with additional revenue well into 1979. In comparison, that exceeds other British actor high-water marks for Sean Connery and Roger Moore in the 1970s playing James Bond ($1m salary + $3-5m depending on revenue interests per film e.g. 5-12%).      He appeared in six films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: Great Expectations (1946), The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Doctor Zhivago (1965), Star Wars (1977) and A Passage to India (1984). With the exception of Star Wars (1977), all the other five films were directed by David Lean. And of those six, The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962) are winners in the category.      Although Alec Guinness and Jack Hawkins each had top billings in The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962), they only shared one scene together in each film. Both coincidentally near the end of each film. Both films also won Best Picture Oscars.Personal Quotes (36)      [on how much he disliked working on Star Wars (1977) and his attempts to encourage George Lucas to kill off Obi-Wan Kenobi] And he agreed with me. What I didn\'t tell him was that I just couldn\'t go on speaking those bloody awful, banal lines. I\'d had enough of the mumbo jumbo.      I shrivel up every time someone mentions Star Wars (1977) to me.      Failure has a thousand explanations. Success doesn\'t need one.      We live in an age of apologies. Apologies, false or true, are expected from the descendants of empire builders, slave owners, persecutors of heretics and from men who, in our eyes, just got it all wrong. So with the age of 85 coming up shortly, I want to make an apology. It appears I must apologize for being male, white and European.      [in 1985 to The Guardian newspaper, on what he intends to do by the end of his life] A kind of little bow, tied on life. And I can see myself drifting off into eternity, or nothing, or whatever it may be, with all sorts of bits of loose string hanging out of my pocket. Why didn\'t I say this or do that, or why didn\'t I reconcile myself with someone? Or make sure that someone whom I like was all right in every way, either financially or, I don\'t know...      [replying to a writer whose script he rejected, who sent him a note saying ""We tailored it just for you""] But no one came to take measurements.      I gave my best performances during the war, trying to be an officer and a gentleman.      I prefer full-length camera shots because the body can act better than the face.      I don\'t know what else I could do but pretend to be an actor.      Once I\'ve done a film, it\'s finished. I never look at it again.      Getting to the theater on the early side, usually about seven o\'clock, changing into a dressing-gown, applying make-up, having a chat for a few minutes with other actors and then, quite unconsciously, beginning to assume another personality which would stay with me (but mostly tucked inside) until curtain down, was all I required of life. I thought it bliss.      An actor is an interpreter of other men\'s words, often a soul which wishes to reveal itself to the world but dare not, a craftsman, a bag of tricks, a vanity bag, a cool observer of mankind, a child and at his best a kind of unfrocked priest who, for an hour or two, can call on heaven and hell to mesmerize a group of innocents.      Personally, I have only one great regret - that I never *dared* enough. If at all.      [To a group of reporters upon winning his Academy Award in 1958]: No doorstop shenanigans for me, boys. I have a nice mantel where I\'m going to display it.      [during filming of Star Wars (1977)]: Apart from the money, I regret having embarked on the film. I like them well enough, but it\'s not an acting job, the dialogue - which is lamentable - keeps being changed and only slightly improved, and I find myself old and out of touch with the young.      [on media reports of his income from the Star Wars films]: The Times reports I\'ve made £4.5 million in the past year. Where do they get such nonsense?      [on the performances in Star Wars (1977)]: The only really disappointing performance was Anthony Daniels as the robot - fidgety and over-elaborately spoken. Not that any of the cast can stand up to the mechanical things around them.      [while considering doing Star Wars (1977)]: Science fiction - which gives me pause - but it is to be directed by George Lucas, who did American Graffiti (1973), which makes me think I should. Big part. Fairytale rubbish, but could be interesting.      [on his first lunch meeting with George Lucas]: I liked him. The conversation was divided culturally by 8,000 miles and 30 years; but I think we might understand each other if I can get past his intensity.      The stage was my prime interest. I had no ambition to be a film actor, and a screen career seemed unlikely to come my way. I\'d done a stage adaption of ""Great Expectations"" before the war and this had been seen by David Lean and Ronald Neame. I went into the navy during the war, and when I came out they were preparing their film [Great Expectations (1946)]. They remembered my performance on the stage and asked me if I\'d go into their film as Herbert Pocket. I\'d thought of film as a much greater mystery than the theater and I felt a need to begin in films with a character I knew something about.      [on The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)]: The original script was ridiculous, with elephant charges and girls screaming round in the jungle. When David Lean arrived, with a new screenwriter, it became a very different thing. I saw Nicholson as an effective part, without ever really believing in the character. However, it paid off; it was a huge success and I got an Oscar for it, though I don\'t think it made an enormous difference in my career.      Essentially I\'m a small part actor who\'s been lucky enough to play leading roles for most of his life.      Flamboyance doesn\'t suit me. I enjoy being elusive.      I am always ashamed of the slowness of my reading. I think it stems from the fact that when I come across dialogue in a novel, I can\'t resist treating it as the text of a play and acting it out, with significant pauses and all.      [on Laurence Olivier after the death of the only acting peer of the realm] Olivier made me laugh more as an actor [in eccentric comedy parts] more than anyone else. In my case, I love him in comedy and am not always sure about him in tragedy.      [his diary entry after viewing Star Wars (1977) for the first time] It\'s a pretty staggering film as spectacle and technically brilliant. Exciting, very noisy and warmhearted. The battle scenes at the end go on for five minutes too long, I feel, and some of the dialogue is excruciating and much of it is lost in noise, but it remains a vivid experience.      An actor is at his best a kind of unfrocked priest who, for an hour or two, can call on heaven and hell to mesmerize a group of innocents.      An actor is totally vulnerable. His total personality is exposed to critical judgment - his intellect, his bearing, his diction, his whole appearance. In short, his ego.      [Asked if he was a rich man]: No, not rich. Compared to striking miners and workless actors very rich: compared to successful stockbrokers and businessmen I expect I would be considered nearly poor.      [Asked if Star Wars (1977) had made him a fortune]: Yes, blessed be Star Wars. But two-thirds of that went to the Inland Revenue and a sizable sum on VAT. No complaints. Let me leave it by saying I can live for the rest of my life in the reasonably modest way I am now used to, that I have no debts and I can afford to refuse work that doesn\'t appeal to me.      [on Star Wars (1977)]: When it came to me in script form, I was in Hollywood on the last day of another movie and I heard it was a script by George Lucas, well that meant something; you know, American Graffiti (1973), this is a new generation, lovely. And then I opened it and saw it was science fiction and groaned, I thought ""oh no, they\'ve got the wrong man."" I started to read it and I thought some of the dialogue was rather creaky, but I kept turning the pages, I wanted to know what happened next. Then I met George Lucas, fell for him, I thought he was a man of enormous integrity and bright and interesting, and I found myself involved and thank God I did.      [on winning the Best Actor award for The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)] No doorstop shenanigans for me. I\'ll put the Oscar on my mantel, which I realize makes very dull copy, except that I\'ll put a mirror on the mantel so that I\'ll get a view of Oscar\'s back too.      I can walk through a crowd and nobody would notice at all.      [on Star Wars (1977)] Can\'t say I\'m enjoying the film. New rubbish dialogue reaches me every other day on wadges of pink paper - and none of it makes my character clear or even bearable. I just think, thankfully, of the lovely bread, which will help me to keep going until next April.      [on playing Gulley Jimson in The Horse\'s Mouth (1958)] I try to get inside a character and project him - one of my own private rules of thumb is that I have not got the character until I have mastered exactly how he walks.      [One day, director Ronald Neame found Guinness sulking in his dressing room, refusing to come to the set. According to Neame, Guinness felt he had not been stroked enough and explained] Actors are emotionally 14-year olds.

She was born Kathleen Walsh in London, England of Irish parentage. She and her sister Peggy were raised in Pimlico by their grandmother. She began her career as a dancer in the chorus of several Andre Charlot revues, before performing solo in New York and Berlin.Kay made her screen debut in Get Your Man (1934) and later appeared in The Luck of the Irish (1936). After appearing as a dancer in the West End show ""The Melody that Got Lost"", the producer Basil Dean signed her to a contract with Ealing Studios. She starred opposite George Formby in the comedies Keep Fit (1937) and I See Ice (1938). She met an aspiring film editor David Lean in 1936 and they were married in 1940. She collaborated on several of his films by writing additional dialogue and advising on production and casting.She made an impression in In Which We Serve (1942), as Queenie Gibbons in This Happy Breed (1944), as Nancy in Oliver Twist (1948), Vice Versa (1948), Stage Fright (1950), The Magnet (1950), Last Holiday (1950), Encore (1951), Young Bess (1953), Lease of Life (1954), Tunes of Glory (1960) and Scrooge (1970). She won a BAFTA nomination and a National Board of Review award for Best Actress for ""The Horse\'s Mouth"" (1958). She retired from acting after appearing in Night Crossing (1982).She was twice married. Following her divorce from David Lean in 1949, she married the Canadian psychologist Elliott Jaques (1917-2003). They adopted a daughter Gemma in 1956, but the marriage was later dissolved.

Stepmother of Peter Lean from her first marriage and the adoptive mother of Gemma Jaques from her second.      She played the doomed Nancy in Oliver Twist (1948), a film for which she wrote a much-hailed opening sequence. She contributed the wordless opening montage, showing the title character\'s mother give birth violently, amid gathering storm clouds and wind-raked tree branches. She said her inspiration was a film she had seen as a child that had long haunted her.      Her relationship with David Lean was best described as torrid and tormented, but even Lean\'s final wife, Sandra, once told a reporter: ""She was terribly in love with him, and although she was an actress, she was in no way a prima donna. Truthfully, I think he should have stayed with her."".      One of her best known roles was as Nancy in Oliver Twist (1948), directed by her then husband David Lean.

My late wife, an artist, loved this film, and it gave me such insights
into the way her mind worked. Guiness is wonderful; for once we see
many levels of the character he portrays. Kay Walsh is so touching as
the woman in his life, while Mike Morgan makes the perfect art groupie.
It's funny to see Dr. Pastorious in old age; he has barely changed
since Bride of Frankenstein.<br><br>The humor is gentle and quiet except for the studio renovation scene,
but it is when Gully stands in front of a canvas that the truth of this
film comes out. His almost soliloquy on the human foot; the scene where
he shrugs and says that was not what he was trying to say, after he has
ruined the toff's wall, these are priceless and our entry into an
artist's mind. When the houseboat sets sail down the Thames, to the
comment about the sea by the looney who pipes Gully aboard is a bit of
perfection set on celluloid. He stands there, framing a vision of
another canvas on the hull of a freighter, while reciting this
wonderful doggerel that I always get mixed up when I try to say it, and
all the while Nosey and Sara spur him on. I've never read the book and
wonder if this represents his death, but I take from it what I will.<br><br>One other thought: there are certain films shot on location that should

One of the best movies about art ever made, `The Horse's Mouth' examines the
relationships between vision and creation, between art and commerce, and 
most importantly  between art and criticism; and makes us laugh at the same
time.  Alec Guinness is inspired (when was he ever not inspired, come to
think of it) as Gully Jimson, a painter of unlimited ideas who has met with
only limited success in the art marketplace  partly because he is so
contemptuous of that marketplace.  His search for the perfect wall on which
to paint, and the subject matter he ultimately winds up painting on one of
the walls found in his search, is priceless.  The Joyce Cary novel, and its
companions in the Jimson trilogy (`Herself Surprised' and `To Be a Pilgrim')
are well worth reading, but this movie is a very British, very engaging
classic.  In many ways, it's the movie that `Pollack' (good though it was)
should have been.

Highly original and entertaining, this film explores the bizarre world
of artist Gulley Jimson (Alec Guinness) whom we meet as he is released
from jail. He's a scammer and a reprobate, but he's also a great artist
who doesn't believe in art. Yet he is compelled to paint.<br><br>With the help of maybe girl friend (Kay Walsh) they try to track down
the paintings sold on the cheap to pay off the debts of his former wife
(Renee Houston). The art dealer (Ernest Thesiger) is a crook and has
cheated everyone by telling them the paintings are worthless. So Gulley
tries to find an art patron who will support him. He finds an older
couple of patrons but after they go on holiday, he moves into their
apartment and trashes it while he paints a mural.<br><br>Gulley is always looking for ""a big wall"" on which to paint his big
paintings and finally finds the side of a building about to be
demolished. His compulsion is so great, he MUST paint on this wall but
has no money, so he ""sells"" sections of the wall to amateurs who
combine to create a fabulous urban mural (to his design). This project
seems to assuage his compulsions, but after the wall's destruction he's
off to find a new horizon... or is he? This is one of Guinness' great
performances. In a comic role with serious undertones, few actors were
ever better than Guinness, and he grabs onto this quirky role with
great gusto. Indeed, Guinness even wrote the script (based on a novel
by Joyce Cary). At age 44, he's totally believable as the grizzled
60-ish artist. The great and underrated Kay Walsh turns in a
ferociously funny turn as the friend he owes money to. Walsh's
character lives in fury that she has been cheated and short-changed by
life. Together, Walsh and Guinness burn up the screen with their acting
talent.<br><br>Co-stars add just the right touch. Houston and Thesiger are old pros.
Michael Gough plays the obsessed sculptor. Veronica Turleigh and Robert
Coote are fun as the art patrons. Gillian Vaughan is a hoot as the
model. May Hallatt is funny as the scrub woman.<br><br>A special word must be said for Mike Morgan who plays Nosey, the
adoring and gangling young man who follows Gulley everywhere. Morgan is
just terrific here with just the right blend of awkward youth and that
special British eccentric comedic touch. In his late 20s, Morgan died
suddenly of meningitis before the film was finished, and several of his
scenes were dubbed by another actor.<br><br>This is a great film.

""Horse's Mouth"" certainly stands up well in it's advanced age; at 45
years old it has remained as timeless as any of the great comedic
films.<br><br>One IMDb writer has tagged Gully as a ""vulgar"" painter, which goes to
show that the sensitivities this film violated are still around.
Pinching your loving ex's bum and tickling the rich lady's knee (shades
of Groucho), though, are pretty tame today.<br><br>Gully Jimson is a rich character, Chaplin-like, who single-mindedly
pursues painting while disillusioning aspiring young Nosey about the
artist's life. All growled on tiptoes by one of film's classic great
actors.<br><br>Jimson is a man who's given up all else, including health, wealth,
conventional relationships, to live in a leaky houseboat with a vision.
But as the story develops it, like all great literature, manages to
puncture almost all of life's rationalizing balloons. Jimson is
valorized as is Don Quixote, without suggesting that his hero's journey
is a painless one.<br><br>All is set in a colorful environment with a delightful if
conventionally unpolished cast, all the improbably gleeful turns that
make the Marx movies so delightful, and a director who contrives
seamlessly with Guiness to create a clever and hilarious marvel that
can be enjoyed over and over.<br><br>Heck yeah, there's even a chase scene! And pull your socks up!<br><br>The DVD version includes a short by Pennebaker that feels as fresh and
contemporary, accompanied by a Duke Ellington tune, which played along
with ""Horse's"" original release.

This is probably my favorite movie. It may be overstatement to call a mere
British comedy a timeless classic, but this outstanding movie, beneath its
raucously madcap surface, has some very serious things to say about what

Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work other than
Star Wars, Alec Guinness produced an amazing body of work--particularly
in the 1940s-1950s--ranging from dramas to quirky comedies. I
particularly love his comedies, as they are so well-done and seem so
natural and real on the screen--far different from the usual fare from
Hollywood.<br><br>I first saw this movie when I was about 13 or so, and didn't appreciate
it very much. Years later, when I became fascinated with Guinness'
comedies, I decided to give it another chance. And boy am I glad I
did!! The movie concerns the life of an extremely edgy and rather nasty
artist. Guinness really plays this up and creates one of the quirkiest
and funniest characters I have ever seen. In essence, the man is a
rascal that is driven to create his art regardless of what it takes to
get it done! What I missed the first time I saw the film were the
extremely catchy music and the amazing art created for this movie. I am
not the biggest fan of modern art, but the second time i saw the movie
I really liked most of the works done for the movie--it just was a darn
shame that much of it was destroyed in the course of the movie! In
addition to music and art, the performances throughout of all the
actors was nearly perfect.<br><br>Finally, the version of the movie I saw last was from the Criterion
Collection. Get this version!!!! It had so much wonderful background
information about the actual art, the making of the movie, and
interesting background information--such as how they got the musical
score WITHOUT having to pay royalties and the incredibly sad tale of a
magnificent performance by a young supporting actor that did not live
to see the finished product.

It's very simple. This film has meant a lot to me. An enlightened art
teacher from high school played this for us in class. I haven't been the
same since. I can't say I know much of Alec Guinness's work, but I count
him
as a personal favorite based on this performance alone. I recommend it to
anyone who wants to be creatively inspired.

Ingenious, fun, silly, playful, entertaining, strange. All of these
things represent not only the movie, but of Alec Guinness' portrayal of
Gully Jimson, a grainy, foul mouthed old artist, trying to make it in
life through his paintings. We're introduced to him from jail, and it
unfolds in the sense where learning about him is also either liking or
hating what life has brought him to be. Just make sure that you're not
going to be an artist, or his protégé (who takes an awful lot of
bullying). This is another forgotten film in time in that it's perfect
casting, and perfect direction. It's an effortless viewing movie that
will bring much satisfaction to viewers of any age, who aren't familiar
with Alec Guinness' work besides the obvious. His passionate, sometimes
surly characterization of a brilliant painter is one that should last
for the ages.

Confession time, I first saw 'The Horse's Mouth' around ten or twelve
years ago, one afternoon on British television and hated it. Alec's
""Gulley Jimson"" seemed to me to be very un-likable and I found myself
unable to get the point of the film. However, re-watching this on DVD,
I found it to be far, far better than I remembered and something of a
revelation.<br><br>I found myself identifying with ""Gulley"" this time around and
appreciating Alec's subtle performance (to the extent that I was
genuinely sad to see the film end). Guinness is backed by two
astonishingly fine performances by Walsh and Houston (it's Rene's
finest performance, for someone with a tendency to play 'broad' here
she is remarkably subtle).<br><br>All in all, a wonderful if sadly under-rated film and one equal to
Alec's best Ealing work.

I love this movie; it's on my all-time (ever-growing) list of the ones
I love to see again and again. Not very surprising, I also loved
reading Joyce Cary's wonderful book. However fine a film version of a
work of literature, there is always more in the text. One of the
glories of this film is how much of Cary's book it brings to full life.
I didn't know, until seeing it in someone else's comment here, that
""The Horse's Mouth"" is only one book of a trilogy about Gulley Jimson.
I will seek out the others as soon as possible. To the person whose
name i didn't think to write down when reading your comment: Thank you

My late wife, an artist, loved this film, and it gave me such insights
into the way her mind worked. Guiness is wonderful; for once we see
many levels of the character he portrays. Kay Walsh is so touching as
the woman in his life, while Mike Morgan makes the perfect art groupie.
It's funny to see Dr. Pastorious in old age; he has barely changed
since Bride of Frankenstein.<br><br>The humor is gentle and quiet except for the studio renovation scene,
but it is when Gully stands in front of a canvas that the truth of this
film comes out. His almost soliloquy on the human foot; the scene where
he shrugs and says that was not what he was trying to say, after he has
ruined the toff's wall, these are priceless and our entry into an
artist's mind. When the houseboat sets sail down the Thames, to the
comment about the sea by the looney who pipes Gully aboard is a bit of
perfection set on celluloid. He stands there, framing a vision of
another canvas on the hull of a freighter, while reciting this
wonderful doggerel that I always get mixed up when I try to say it, and
all the while Nosey and Sara spur him on. I've never read the book and
wonder if this represents his death, but I take from it what I will.<br><br>One other thought: there are certain films shot on location that should
be filed away as time/place documentaries. This one is a perfect
example: London 1958.

One of the best movies about art ever made, `The Horse's Mouth' examines the
relationships between vision and creation, between art and commerce, and 
most importantly  between art and criticism; and makes us laugh at the same
time.  Alec Guinness is inspired (when was he ever not inspired, come to
think of it) as Gully Jimson, a painter of unlimited ideas who has met with
only limited success in the art marketplace  partly because he is so
contemptuous of that marketplace.  His search for the perfect wall on which
to paint, and the subject matter he ultimately winds up painting on one of
the walls found in his search, is priceless.  The Joyce Cary novel, and its
companions in the Jimson trilogy (`Herself Surprised' and `To Be a Pilgrim')
are well worth reading, but this movie is a very British, very engaging
classic.  In many ways, it's the movie that `Pollack' (good though it was)
should have been.

Highly original and entertaining, this film explores the bizarre world
of artist Gulley Jimson (Alec Guinness) whom we meet as he is released
from jail. He's a scammer and a reprobate, but he's also a great artist
who doesn't believe in art. Yet he is compelled to paint.<br><br>With the help of maybe girl friend (Kay Walsh) they try to track down
the paintings sold on the cheap to pay off the debts of his former wife
(Renee Houston). The art dealer (Ernest Thesiger) is a crook and has
cheated everyone by telling them the paintings are worthless. So Gulley
tries to find an art patron who will support him. He finds an older
couple of patrons but after they go on holiday, he moves into their
apartment and trashes it while he paints a mural.<br><br>Gulley is always looking for ""a big wall"" on which to paint his big
paintings and finally finds the side of a building about to be
demolished. His compulsion is so great, he MUST paint on this wall but
has no money, so he ""sells"" sections of the wall to amateurs who
combine to create a fabulous urban mural (to his design). This project
seems to assuage his compulsions, but after the wall's destruction he's
off to find a new horizon... or is he? This is one of Guinness' great
performances. In a comic role with serious undertones, few actors were
ever better than Guinness, and he grabs onto this quirky role with
great gusto. Indeed, Guinness even wrote the script (based on a novel
by Joyce Cary). At age 44, he's totally believable as the grizzled
60-ish artist. The great and underrated Kay Walsh turns in a
ferociously funny turn as the friend he owes money to. Walsh's
character lives in fury that she has been cheated and short-changed by
life. Together, Walsh and Guinness burn up the screen with their acting
talent.<br><br>Co-stars add just the right touch. Houston and Thesiger are old pros.
Michael Gough plays the obsessed sculptor. Veronica Turleigh and Robert
Coote are fun as the art patrons. Gillian Vaughan is a hoot as the
model. May Hallatt is funny as the scrub woman.<br><br>A special word must be said for Mike Morgan who plays Nosey, the
adoring and gangling young man who follows Gulley everywhere. Morgan is
just terrific here with just the right blend of awkward youth and that
special British eccentric comedic touch. In his late 20s, Morgan died
suddenly of meningitis before the film was finished, and several of his
scenes were dubbed by another actor.<br><br>This is a great film.

""Horse's Mouth"" certainly stands up well in it's advanced age; at 45
years old it has remained as timeless as any of the great comedic
films.<br><br>One IMDb writer has tagged Gully as a ""vulgar"" painter, which goes to
show that the sensitivities this film violated are still around.
Pinching your loving ex's bum and tickling the rich lady's knee (shades
of Groucho), though, are pretty tame today.<br><br>Gully Jimson is a rich character, Chaplin-like, who single-mindedly
pursues painting while disillusioning aspiring young Nosey about the
artist's life. All growled on tiptoes by one of film's classic great
actors.<br><br>Jimson is a man who's given up all else, including health, wealth,
conventional relationships, to live in a leaky houseboat with a vision.
But as the story develops it, like all great literature, manages to
puncture almost all of life's rationalizing balloons. Jimson is
valorized as is Don Quixote, without suggesting that his hero's journey
is a painless one.<br><br>All is set in a colorful environment with a delightful if
conventionally unpolished cast, all the improbably gleeful turns that
make the Marx movies so delightful, and a director who contrives
seamlessly with Guiness to create a clever and hilarious marvel that
can be enjoyed over and over.<br><br>Heck yeah, there's even a chase scene! And pull your socks up!<br><br>The DVD version includes a short by Pennebaker that feels as fresh and
contemporary, accompanied by a Duke Ellington tune, which played along
with ""Horse's"" original release.

This is probably my favorite movie. It may be overstatement to call a mere
British comedy a timeless classic, but this outstanding movie, beneath its
raucously madcap surface, has some very serious things to say about what
it
means to be an artist, to be driven by visions while living in a society
that doesn't care. I think Guinness is the greatest actor of the century,
and that his performance here as the maddening, irascible, impossible

He was born in Rochester, New York, to Sarah Jane (Price), an actress, and Arthur Washington Lithgow III, who was both a theatrical producer and director. John\'s father was born in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, where the Anglo-American Lithgow family had lived for several generations.John moved frequently as a child, while his father founded and managed local and college theaters and Shakespeare festivals throughout the Midwest of the United States. Not until he was 16, and his father became head of the McCarter Theater in Princeton New Jersey, did the family settle down. But for John, the theater was still not a career. He won a scholarship to Harvard University, where he finally caught the acting bug (as well as found a wife). Harvard was followed by a Fulbright scholarship to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. Returning from London, his rigorous dramatic training stood him in good stead, and a distinguished career on Broadway gave him one Tony Award for ""The Changing Room"", a second nomination in 1985 for ""Requiem For a Heavyweight"", and a third in 1988 for ""M. Butterfly"". But with critical acclaim came personal confusion, and in the mid 1970s, he and his wife divorced. He entered therapy, and in 1982, his life started in a new direction, the movies - he received an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Roberta Muldoon in The World According to Garp (1982). A second Oscar nomination followed for Terms of Endearment (1983), and he met a UCLA economics professor who became his second wife. As the decade of the 1990s came around, he found that he was spending too much time on location, and another career move brought him to television in the hugely successful series 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996). This production also played a role in bringing him back together with the son from his first marriage, Ian Lithgow, who has a regular role in the series as a dimwitted student.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Bruce Cameron <dumarest@midcoast.com>          Spouse (2)               Mary Yeager          (12 December\xa01981            - present)\xa0(2 children)                         Jean Taynton          (10 September\xa01966            - 1980)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)          Trade Mark (6)        Distinctive dramatic voice        Towering height and slender frame        Often plays villains or mentally unstable characters        Often plays fathers and family men        Wild, over-the-top acting.

He attended Harvard College and graduated with a Bachelor\'s degree magna cum laude in history and literature (1967). He lived in Adams House as an undergraduate. Lithgow later served on Harvard\'s Board of Overseers.      He studied at London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.      He was named a Fulbright scholar.      He is the parent of Ian Lithgow with Jean Taynton, and Phoebe Lithgow and Nathan Lithgow with Mary Yeager.      He hosted the Welcoming Reception for UCLA\'s new Chancellor Carnesale.      He claims that his most difficult performance was in Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983) because he had to portray fear of the monster, although he could not really see it.      He was the original voice of Hades in Disney\'s Hercules (1997) and recorded all the dialogue, but his performance was then replaced by the performance of James Woods.      He was considered for the role of Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs (1991), which went to Anthony Hopkins.      In May 2002, he won both the Tony Award and Drama Desk Award as Best Actor in a Broadway musical for his performance in ""Sweet Smell of Success"".      His wife Mary Yeager is an economics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.      His father ran a Shakespearian Acting company in the 1950s which included David Carradine.

Farmington Hills, MI: Gale, 2004.      He was considered for the role of Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown in Back to the Future (1985), which went to Christopher Lloyd.      He has provided the voice of Yoda in the NPR radio dramatizations of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1983) and ""Return of the Jedi"" (1996).      He has won two Tony Awards: in 1973, as Best Supporting or Featured Actor (Dramatic) for David Storey\'s ""The Changing Room""; and in 2002, as Best Actor (Musical) for ""Sweet Smell of Success."" He has also been nominated on three occasions for Tonys -- two for Best Actor (Play): for ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" (1985) and ""M. Butterfly."" (1988), and once for Best Actor (Musical): for ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" (2005).      He was called in to replace another actor in Terms of Endearment (1983), and his role was filmed in three days during a break from filming Footloose (1984).      Three of his non-film roles have been based on movies involving Frank Oz and Ian McDiarmid. Most of Oz\'s and McDiarmid\'s collaborations are the Star Wars films, in which they play Yoda and Darth Sidious, respectively. Lithgow played Yoda on the radio. Oz also directed McDiarmid in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988). Lithgow appeared in the stage musical.      He is a registered pastor of Rose Ministries and has officiated the wedding of his goddaughter.      He is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences (AMPAS).      Even though his parents were both actors, he was inspired to get into acting by Peter Sellers.      His ancestry includes Welsh (from his maternal grandfather), English, as well as French, Scots-Irish (Northern Irish), and Scottish. His father was born in the Dominican Republic, where the white American Lithgow family had lived for a few generations.      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6666 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on May 2, 2001.      Despite being known for playing characters who are often pompous and unlikable or outright villainous, he has been described by many of his co-stars as an extremely kind and friendly man and a pleasure to work with.      He has two grandchildren through his son, Ian Lithgow.      He has said that Chaplin\'s Modern Times (1936) is his favorite film.      He is a celebrity spokesperson for Campbell Select soups since 2006.      He is an accomplished guitar player.      He lives in Los Angeles, California.      The role of Frasier Craine (first on Cheers then the spin-off) was written with Lithgow in mind. He\'s said years later, ""Kelsey [Grammer] did a fine job!"".      He was considered for the role of The Joker in Batman (1989).      He was awarded the 1989 Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for Distinguished Achievement, Lead Performance, ""Who\'s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,"" at Center Theatre Group/Ahmanson Theatre production at the James A. Doolittle Theatre (University of California) in Los Angeles, California.      He was awarded the 1973 Antoinette Perry (Tony) Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play for ""The Changing Room"" on Broadway in New York City.      For his Broadway debut, Lithgow appeared in David Storey\'s ""The Changing Room"" on March 7, 1973, and won the Tony Award 18 days later (March 25) setting a record for a Broadway acting debut.      As a youth, John and his siblings were often babysat by Coretta Scott (later Coretta Scott King) in Yellow Springs, Ohio.      He is just 12 years older than Lori Singer, who played his daughter in Footloose (1984).      In common with the veteran English character actor Robert Hardy, he has played both American president Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill on screen.      Friends with Alfred Molina.Personal Quotes (11)      [on the constant time-slot changes and ultimate cancellation of 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996)] If NBC had set out to ruin it, they couldn\'t have done a better job. They kept trying to use us as a weapon instead of a show to be taken care of. It would have been nice to have stayed a big hit, but I\'d rather be a great show that nobody was watching than a lousy show that was a big hit, which is the case for most of the others.      In general, my basic rule of thumb is just act in things you would want to see yourself in. I have a taste for all kinds of movies. Usually, it\'s a question of whether it will be fun, whether I respect the people behind it, whether I would like to work with them. I\'m sure I\'m a serious-minded actor, but I still value the frivolity of acting. It\'s a real exuberant, entertaining thing to do. I never lose track of that.      I\'ve had parallel careers in the theatre and in movies. In the theatre, I often play characters with a strong sense of innocence who aren\'t as intelligent as I am. The reason: my size. I seem sort of big and good-natured on stage. It would be too much for a big man to play a forbidding character on stage. So I play big people who are fairly gentle. It\'s a wonderful thing to build a career on. What I offer to movie-makers is that I can put a tremendous amount of theatrical background and technical equipment at their disposal. I can make believable the over-the-top characters.      [from a 1984 interview] My career just happened to me. I didn\'t manage it. My plate is full all the time, but I never have the opportunity to choose from ten parts. I do turn down junk. I\'ve played important parts in movies but I haven\'t yet played the person the story is about. The joy is in the work. You can get too hung up on where you are. I\'m not preoccupied with the desire to be top banana, but I do want to play bigger parts.      We deal in very volatile chemicals. We\'re in the business of using real emotions to bring pretend emotions to life. We all have our secrets and we all have our deceptions. Acting, at its best, is all about deceiving people, and that makes it all the more interesting to us.      One of the things you learn as an actor is that human beings are capable of almost anything. I\'m sort of in the business of illustrating that fact.      My sense of myself is that I\'m a character actor, and character actors are ready, willing and able to do anything, to be totally different from themselves. That\'s my job, to be ready. I\'m some kind of first responder.      No bad guy thinks he\'s a bad guy. He thinks he\'s a good guy.      [on working with Saul Zaentz on At Play in the Fields of the Lord (1991)] Saul loves being answerable to nobody. That\'s the most extraordinary thing about him. The dailies didn\'t get sent anywhere for anybody else\'s approval and cost overruns weren\'t monitored by a bunch of executives thousand of miles away. He owns it all. He does it the way he wants it. It\'s incredible how that affects every aspect of production. I\'ve never really worked with anyone like him. Being on the set, playing hearts with Saul, I realised the secret to his success: he can spot everyone\'s strengths and weaknesses right away. He was a killer. He\'d shoot the moon three out of every four games. I don\'t know if it was the giant bugs or the humidity, but I couldn\'t sleep for weeks. We had terrible weather and horrible actor-director arguments, but Saul was unflappable. He went through all the same hardships we did, but he behaved as if there was no other place he\'d rather be.      [on the character usually played by his favorite French comic actor Jacques Tati] He was always a bit oblivious, just a little bit startled by everything, and acted in a completely rational but inappropriate way to whatever happened.

building atomic bombs is to build one himself. (And they're warmongering
because they want to build atomic bombs because hostile countries with a

do the same to the US if they could because they also have atomic bombs,

weapons grade material and has built a bomb with it, they have to gall to
take over his mom's house while she cries ""What gives you the
right?!""<br><br>Then, and get this, then, when he learns the government has found out he has
stolen weapons grade material and built a bomb with it, and he threatens to
set it off for no other logical reason anyone can think of other than not
wanting to get thrown in jail for something HE did, everyone acts surprised
when the government acts ready to kill him to stop him and everyone thinks
that's just a terrible thing. No, wait, they want to kill him not just to
stop him, but also to keep the facility a secret.... after a whole bunch of
people already know what's going on.<br><br>And when the bomb almost goes off because this genius kid was too stupid to
know what he was doing, he gets to walk away as a local hero because he
built a bomb with weapons grade material that he stole from the facility and
almost wiped out his friends, family, everyone in the town and surrounding
areas including the mean government officials who were ready to kill him

I don't even wanna talk about it, I just wanna cut it down and leave it
for dead. Or with other words, don't watch it unless you wanna make fun
of it later! It's a half lame movie for little kids who haven't had a
physics class yet and who's parents are willing to explain that
something like that is never possible in real life. Here are some
examples why (to get you started)<br><br>- The material being so highly concentrated I would imagine when he
opens the hatch to get the jar out he'd immediately lose consciousness
and die within minutes. No yellow rubber gloves are gonna protect him
from the radiation.<br><br>- It looks like he's going for an implosion design with his bomb (like
the Nagasaki bomb). That's really ""smart"". Especially since the gun
design (Hiroshima bomb) is far easier to build, but maybe he is aware
that the implosion design will have a far greater efficiency so he can
incinerate far more people with it, if that's what he wants? (That's
where another thought occurs: Why is he complaining about the morality
of the lab when he builds a bomb of his own?) <br><br>- Then there is more unprotected working with the material. Even if the
material was only slightly radioactive for some reason, his nice fluffy
hair would have fallen out halfway through building his device. At the
least we would have seen lots of vomiting! <br><br>To sum it up, tired of writing this as I am, it's just all horrible
anyway! I can't understand why a movie with that name couldn't have
been a bit more interesting, realistic and possibly talk about the real
Manhattan Project instead!

I was subjected to this utter nonsense at a friend's house. I won't go
into why. At first I thought it ""wasn't bad."" But as the ""plot""
continued, I thought someone must have spiked the punch and I was high
on LSD. This is one of the silliest movies ever made. There are so many
stupid ideas one has to wonder if it was designed to make fun of movies
as a whole. The ""brilliant"" kid wants to build a bomb to expose the lab
for making plutonium? Hey, pick up the phone and make a call. He thinks
that he can't get into any trouble because ""I'm only a kid."" Who told
him that? For a bright boy, he doesn't seem like it. He breaks into the
lab and steals plutonium... that ought to be worth 20 to life right
there. He's Edward Teller in disguise and builds an A bomb with his
Mattel Do it yourself kit. Yeah... sure. Best of all, he handles the
plutonium with his mom's dish washing rubber gloves?!!! He'd be dead in
no time. He takes his bomb to the big fair to show off? To show off
what? That he's a complete nincompoop? Even the other nerds know better
than that. If I hadn't been waiting for another friend in order to
leave, I would have exited this complete nonsense as soon as he started
playing cutesy with the plutonium strapped to the back of his toy car.
This was really, really bad. 1 star for Lithgow desperately seeking a
plot. 1 Star for Nixon trying ever so hard not to break out in
uproarious laughter while Collet tries to explain why he wants to make
a bomb.

I remember watching this movie in the 80s, and thinking it was a good
film. There was, however, one major problem that I had with the film -
the fact that the main protagonist seems to be a dummy when it comes to
anything other than science. Forgetting about the fact that Paul, one
of the main characters, essentially exposed a bunch of people to high-
grade plutonium (no mention about any medical crisis for all the people
around Paul after the happy ending), the kicker comes when he's finally
confronted in a hotel in New York by John Lithgow and a bevy of
military men who would like nothing more than to lock him away for a
long time. Paul's nonchalance comes out in the exchange, ""They can't do
anything to me."" ""Why not?"" ""Because I'm underage."" <br><br>HUH? You're smart enough to build a freaking nuclear bomb by yourself,
including smart enough to know where to get some explosive material
needed to blow the bomb up. You're also smart enough to have fooled a
high-security system with a bunch of frisbees and a helpful girlfriend
in order to get the plutonium (and smart enough to temporarily cover
your tracks by inserting shampoo into the jar so it's not immediately
noticed as missing). But what in the world makes you think that they'll
let you go because ""I'm underage?"" <br><br>I suppose the script writer needed to show a little naiveté - after
all, if Paul knew the full gravity of what he was doing, he might not
have done something as reckless as he did. Instead, he might just have
gone ahead with an expose without needing to win first prize at a
science contest.

This film is entertaining enough, in fact it is quite exciting.
However, in a real-life scenario, the end result would not and could
not have had such a clichéd ""Hollywood ending"", so in that respect it
sort of resembles a ""fractured fairytale"". The storyline is credible
enough with a bit of imagination stretching, the acting is tolerable,
only the irony is laid on a bit too thick. I found the attitude of the
principal character to be much too cynical, unrealistic and extremely
condescending, even for the likes of some precocious, science-savvy
prodigy. Getting back to the entertainment value, the plot progresses
expectedly only it thickens toward the direction of the surrealistic,
though the basic concept is actually pretty frightening. However, the
movie is watchable with its impressive cast; a young Cynthia Nixon,
John Lithgow, Chris Collet et al. I have mixed feelings about this
film, I did enjoy watching it, but when I began to rationalize it began
to appear quite nonsensical. So, if you intend on watching it, simply
keep your powers of logic and common sense subdued and it will remain
an enjoyable experience.

I beg to disagree with some of the reviewers who believe that this film
is some sort of deep commentary on the Cold War mentality of the 60's
and 70's, coupled with sharp insight into the madness of the nuclear
arms race.<br><br>This is a simple-minded ""WarGames"" wannabe, with totally unsympathetic
characters (including the stereotypical idiot adults who can barely tie
their shoelaces) engaging in wildly improbable/impossible activities.<br><br>This is an excellent example of why snot-nosed, self-righteous kids are
not allowed to vote.<br><br>Minor Spoiler: ""Hey, my self-gratification and desire to win the
science fair surely trumps any concern for public safety or property
rights. Plus, I get to feel like some sort of public-policy activist
while I'm doing it!"" <br><br>Yet, all of this might be forgivable, if the movie was any good. But
it's not. Save your time and money.

A boy genius builds an atomic bomb with plutonium he steals from his
mother's would-be boyfriend. A barely plausible premise but what the
heck it's a movie. I can only imagine the producers and actors all
anticipating the acclaim that they hope to achieve with this ripoff of
'War Games'. 'War Games' featuring Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy
was clever, hip, interesting, funny at times and believable: everything
that this movie is not. The first scare is John Lithgow as a love
interest with Jill Eikenberry. He is not likely to set feminine hearts
aflutter and Jill looks great except that her hair looks like it lost a
battle with a wombat. As to the cliché's (forgive me if I leave out a
few dozen, as there are so many): 1) The kid opens everything with a
handy nail file from his nail clipper that he always happens to have in
his pocket. He even opens pin-tumbler locks which I assure you are not
amenable to nail files. 2) He breaks into the lab to steal the
plutonium, swaps it with a bottle of shampoo, then packs everything
back into his gym bag, EXCEPT the plutonium which he tapes to the back
of a remote control car. You see if he just put the plutonium in his
gym bag with all the other stuff (including the huge remote controller
for the car) there would be no reason to fire up the enormous Argon-Ion
LASER BEAM which he uses to cut a hole in the building to smuggle out
the plutonium. And of course the cutsey part where the dodering old
fool of a security guard would have no reason to stumble around in dark
with flashlight looking for god knows whatever while the kid zooms the
car around. Duh! 3) Lithgow brings the kid a puzzle where you are
supposed to get four balls in each corner, the kid sets it down and
spins it. Eureka problems solved! Only you can see that coming a mile
away. And the grand prize cliché is at the end, when they all must clip
the six detonator wires SIMULTANIOUSLY! GASP! to prevent the impending
nuclear explosion. Except that they only have (I bet you know already)
FIVE wire cutters! But guess what? The kid whips out his handy-dandy
nail clipper to save the day! TA-DA! Whoooo Maybe I'm being harsh and
taking advantage of twenty years of hindsight, after all lasers now fit
on key chains instead of taking up entire rooms, but seriously the
technical direction in this movie is awful. Despite all that it is
entertaining and if you have the opportunity watch it. And while you
watch take a good look at all the actors that you will never see again
after contributing to this bomb.

If the beauty of film is that it encourages us to briefly suspend our
disbelief and enjoy experiencing a different world, The Manhattan Project
simply demands too much suspension of disbelief to make this possible.<br><br>Almost every plot point in The Manhattan Project is an absolute
impossibility in real life, even though the dramatic power of this film
ostensibly derives from the notion that something remotely like this could
really happen. From nuclear radiation triggering detectors without hurting
people, to a single rent-a-cop defending an entire nuclear weapons lab, to
one teenager doing in a month what took Oppenheimer and company years, to
the U.S. military letting national security breaches walk away into the
sunset, there is just no way to focus on the story when faced with so many
intellectual insults. <br><br>On the bright side, the science in the movie is presented well and seems
fairly accurate, so it does seem like the filmmakers at least tried to make
something special out of an insufficient screenplay. The Manhattan Project
is not a terrible movie, but it does suffer from too many inexcusable lapses
to be called good. Just like the most realistic character in the movie, this
film is a bomb.

THE MANHATTAN PROJECT is a seriously underrated film.  It's categorized and
advertised as a ""comedy,"" but in fact it's more accurately categorized as a
dramatic thriller with light elements.  The problem is that anyone expecting
to see a comedy will be disappointed because the film is not as funny as a
""comedy"" needs to be.  That, I believe, is why it was not as popular at the
box office as it deserved to be.  However, the film is an extremely smart
dramatic thriller, and anyone screening it with that expectation -- and
knowing its main characters are extremely bright high school kids -- will
not be disappointed.  THE MANHATTAN PROJECT is not a perfect film, but it is
an excellent one.

in order to get the plutonium (and smart enough to temporarily cover
your tracks by inserting shampoo into the jar so it's not immediately
noticed as missing). But what in the world makes you think that they'll
let you go because ""I'm underage?"" <br><br>I suppose the script writer needed to show a little naiveté - after
all, if Paul knew the full gravity of what he was doing, he might not
have done something as reckless as he did. Instead, he might just have
gone ahead with an expose without needing to win first prize at a
science contest.

This film is entertaining enough, in fact it is quite exciting.
However, in a real-life scenario, the end result would not and could
not have had such a clichéd ""Hollywood ending"", so in that respect it
sort of resembles a ""fractured fairytale"". The storyline is credible
enough with a bit of imagination stretching, the acting is tolerable,
only the irony is laid on a bit too thick. I found the attitude of the
principal character to be much too cynical, unrealistic and extremely
condescending, even for the likes of some precocious, science-savvy
prodigy. Getting back to the entertainment value, the plot progresses
expectedly only it thickens toward the direction of the surrealistic,
though the basic concept is actually pretty frightening. However, the
movie is watchable with its impressive cast; a young Cynthia Nixon,
John Lithgow, Chris Collet et al. I have mixed feelings about this
film, I did enjoy watching it, but when I began to rationalize it began
to appear quite nonsensical. So, if you intend on watching it, simply
keep your powers of logic and common sense subdued and it will remain
an enjoyable experience.

I beg to disagree with some of the reviewers who believe that this film
is some sort of deep commentary on the Cold War mentality of the 60's
and 70's, coupled with sharp insight into the madness of the nuclear
arms race.<br><br>This is a simple-minded ""WarGames"" wannabe, with totally unsympathetic
characters (including the stereotypical idiot adults who can barely tie
their shoelaces) engaging in wildly improbable/impossible activities.<br><br>This is an excellent example of why snot-nosed, self-righteous kids are
not allowed to vote.<br><br>Minor Spoiler: ""Hey, my self-gratification and desire to win the
science fair surely trumps any concern for public safety or property
rights. Plus, I get to feel like some sort of public-policy activist
while I'm doing it!"" <br><br>Yet, all of this might be forgivable, if the movie was any good. But
it's not. Save your time and money.

A boy genius builds an atomic bomb with plutonium he steals from his
mother's would-be boyfriend. A barely plausible premise but what the
heck it's a movie. I can only imagine the producers and actors all
anticipating the acclaim that they hope to achieve with this ripoff of
'War Games'. 'War Games' featuring Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy
was clever, hip, interesting, funny at times and believable: everything
that this movie is not. The first scare is John Lithgow as a love
interest with Jill Eikenberry. He is not likely to set feminine hearts
aflutter and Jill looks great except that her hair looks like it lost a
battle with a wombat. As to the cliché's (forgive me if I leave out a
few dozen, as there are so many): 1) The kid opens everything with a
handy nail file from his nail clipper that he always happens to have in
his pocket. He even opens pin-tumbler locks which I assure you are not
amenable to nail files. 2) He breaks into the lab to steal the
plutonium, swaps it with a bottle of shampoo, then packs everything
back into his gym bag, EXCEPT the plutonium which he tapes to the back
of a remote control car. You see if he just put the plutonium in his
gym bag with all the other stuff (including the huge remote controller
for the car) there would be no reason to fire up the enormous Argon-Ion
LASER BEAM which he uses to cut a hole in the building to smuggle out
the plutonium. And of course the cutsey part where the dodering old
fool of a security guard would have no reason to stumble around in dark
with flashlight looking for god knows whatever while the kid zooms the
car around. Duh! 3) Lithgow brings the kid a puzzle where you are
supposed to get four balls in each corner, the kid sets it down and
spins it. Eureka problems solved! Only you can see that coming a mile
away. And the grand prize cliché is at the end, when they all must clip
the six detonator wires SIMULTANIOUSLY! GASP! to prevent the impending
nuclear explosion. Except that they only have (I bet you know already)
FIVE wire cutters! But guess what? The kid whips out his handy-dandy
nail clipper to save the day! TA-DA! Whoooo Maybe I'm being harsh and
taking advantage of twenty years of hindsight, after all lasers now fit
on key chains instead of taking up entire rooms, but seriously the
technical direction in this movie is awful. Despite all that it is
entertaining and if you have the opportunity watch it. And while you
watch take a good look at all the actors that you will never see again
after contributing to this bomb.

If the beauty of film is that it encourages us to briefly suspend our
disbelief and enjoy experiencing a different world, The Manhattan Project
simply demands too much suspension of disbelief to make this possible.<br><br>Almost every plot point in The Manhattan Project is an absolute
impossibility in real life, even though the dramatic power of this film
ostensibly derives from the notion that something remotely like this could
really happen. From nuclear radiation triggering detectors without hurting
people, to a single rent-a-cop defending an entire nuclear weapons lab, to
one teenager doing in a month what took Oppenheimer and company years, to
the U.S. military letting national security breaches walk away into the
sunset, there is just no way to focus on the story when faced with so many
intellectual insults. <br><br>On the bright side, the science in the movie is presented well and seems
fairly accurate, so it does seem like the filmmakers at least tried to make
something special out of an insufficient screenplay. The Manhattan Project
is not a terrible movie, but it does suffer from too many inexcusable lapses
to be called good. Just like the most realistic character in the movie, this
film is a bomb.

THE MANHATTAN PROJECT is a seriously underrated film.  It's categorized and
advertised as a ""comedy,"" but in fact it's more accurately categorized as a
dramatic thriller with light elements.  The problem is that anyone expecting
to see a comedy will be disappointed because the film is not as funny as a
""comedy"" needs to be.  That, I believe, is why it was not as popular at the
box office as it deserved to be.  However, the film is an extremely smart
dramatic thriller, and anyone screening it with that expectation -- and
knowing its main characters are extremely bright high school kids -- will
not be disappointed.  THE MANHATTAN PROJECT is not a perfect film, but it is
an excellent one.

His father, actor Martin Sheen (born Ramon Antonio Gerard Estevez), was at the time just breaking into the business, with performances on Broadway. His mother, Janet Sheen (née Templeton), was a former New York art student who had met Charlie\'s father right after he had moved to Manhattan. Martin and Janet had three other children, Emilio Estevez, Renée Estevez, and Ramon Estevez, all of whom became actors. His father is of half Spanish and half Irish descent, and his mother, whose family is from Kentucky, has English and Scottish ancestry.At a young age, Charlie took an interest in his father\'s acting career. When he was nine, he was given a small part in his dad\'s movie The Execution of Private Slovik (1974). In 1977, he was in the Philippines where his dad suffered a near-fatal heart attack on the set of Apocalypse Now (1979).While at Santa Monica High School, Charlie had two major interests: acting and baseball. Along with his friends, which included Rob Lowe and Sean Penn, he produced and starred in several amateur Super-8 films. On the Vikings baseball team, he was a star shortstop and pitcher. His lifetime record as a pitcher was 40-15. His interest and skill in baseball would later influence some of his movie roles. Unfortunately, his success on the baseball field did not translate to success in the classroom, as he struggled to keep his grades up. Just a few weeks before his scheduled graduation date, Charlie was expelled due to poor attendance and bad grades.After high school, Charlie aggressively pursued many acting roles. His first major role was as a high school student in the teen war film Red Dawn (1984). He followed this up with relatively small roles in TV movies and low-profile releases. His big break came in 1986 when he starred in Oliver Stone\'s Oscar winning epic Platoon (1986). He drew rave reviews for his portrayal of a young soldier who is caught in the center of a moral crisis in Vietnam.The success of Platoon (1986) prompted Oliver Stone to cast Charlie in his next movie Wall Street (1987) alongside his father and veteran actor Martin Sheen. The movie with its ""Greed is Good"" theme became an instant hit with viewers.Shortly after, Stone approached Charlie about the starring role in his next movie, Born on the Fourth of July (1989). When Tom Cruise eventually got the part, Sheen ended up hearing the news from his brother Emilio Estevez and not even getting as much as a call from Stone. This led to a fallout, and the two have not worked together since.The fallout with Stone, however, did nothing to hurt Charlie\'s career in the late 1980s and early \'90s, as he continued to establish himself as one of the top box office draws with a string of hits that included Young Guns (1988), Major League (1989), and Hot Shots! (1991). However, as the mid-\'90s neared, his good fortune both personally and professionally, soon came to an end.Around this time, Charlie, who had already been to drug rehab, was beginning to develop a reputation as a hard-partying, womanizer. In 1995, the same year he was briefly married to model Donna Peele, he was called to testify at the trial of Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss. At the trial, while under oath he admitted to spending nearly $50,000 on 27 of Fleiss\' $2,500-a-night prostitutes.His downward spiral continued the following year when his ex-girlfriend Brittany Ashland filed charges claiming that he physically abused her. He was later charged with misdemeanor battery to which he pleaded no contest and was given a year\'s suspended sentence, two years\' probation and a $2,800 fine. He finally hit rock bottom in May 1998 when he was hospitalized in Thousand Oaks, California, following a near-fatal drug overdose. Later that month, he was ordered back to the drug rehab center, which he had previously left after one day.During this stretch, Charlie\'s film career began to suffer as well. He starred in a series of box office flops that included The Arrival (1996) and Shadow Conspiracy (1997). However as the 1990s came to end, so did Charlie\'s string of bad luck.In 2000, Charlie, now clean and sober, was chosen to replace Michael J. Fox on the ABC hit sitcom Spin City (1996). Though his stint lasted only two seasons, Charlie\'s performance caught the eye of CBS executives who in 2003 were looking for an established star to help carry their Monday night lineup of sitcoms that included Everybody Loves Raymond (1996). The sitcom Two and a Half Men (2003) starred Charlie as a swinging, irresponsible womanizer whose life changes when his nephew suddenly appears on his doorstep. The show became a huge hit, breathing much needed life into Charlie\'s fading career.Charlie\'s personal life also appeared to be improving. In 2002, he married actress Denise Richards, whom he first met while shooting the movie Good Advice (2001). In March 2004, they had a daughter, Sam, and it was announced shortly after that Denise was pregnant with the couple\'s second child. By all reports, the couple seemed to be very happy together. However, like all of Charlie\'s previous relationships, the stability did not last long. In March of 2005, Denise, who was six-months pregnant, filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. She gave birth to a second daughter, Lola, in June of that same year. Their divorce became final in late 2006.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       SteveG          Spouse (3) Brooke Mueller (30 May\xa02008            - 2 May\xa02011)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(2 children)           Denise Richards (15 June\xa02002            - 30 November\xa02006)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(2 children)           Donna Peele (3 September\xa01995            - 19 November\xa01996)\xa0(divorced)          Trade Mark (4)        Catchphrase: ""Winning!""

He was offered a scholarship to play baseball by the University of Kansas.

Yet they pull you aside at a party and say you\'re their hero for the things you do. [Variety (August 14, 1997)]      ""This is like a sober acid trip"" (his reaction to winning the Golden Globe Award!)      Usually in a battle sequence when a bomb is going off, you forget you\'re acting.      I don\'t think it\'s wise to dwell on regret. There\'s regret, sure. But whatever you\'ve done good or bad, is a part of who you are now. That\'s the thing you can change and improve.      ""I\'d begun drinking all the time. We shot in New York City, so I\'d be out to the bars every night till 3 or 4 a.m., then try to show up for a 6 o\'clock call to stand toe to toe with Michael Douglas and handle 50% of a scene. How could that work? Yet there I was, the guy that struck gold, looking around at dawn to find that the only one still partying was me. I\'d be drinking away, doing blow [cocaine], popping pills, and telling myself I wasn\'t an addict, because there wasn\'t a needle stuck in my arm. Talk about mixing up fantasy and reality! My true addiction was alcohol. The extra toxic boosters just helped me shore up the wall between my celebrity self and my real self. The questions I was running from were: \'Is this success all a fluke? Had I been fooling everybody so far? Will I get caught?\' It was easy to get hammered and messed up. But in doing so, I buried my self-respect, I buried my self-esteem, I buried my creative drive, and I damned near buried myself."" - On filming Wall Street (1987) and his life at the time.      ""The same role had been offered to Emilio a year earlier but the financing fell through. This time, Emilio was on another project, so Oliver Stone offered it to me. It was the break of my life, and I knew it. But it was a strange experience, because we filmed in the Philippines, less than 100 miles away from where my dad had filmed Apocalypse Now (1979). People say I look like him - now, here I was, not only making a picture about Vietnam the way he did, but also narrating it the way he did. And, like him, I had a moment that came close to death, when I fell halfway out of a helicopter, but was caught just in time by one of the actors."" - On Platoon (1986).      ""I was 10 years old. Dad used to take us on location so the family wouldn\'t be split up, so we were with him in the Philippines. That\'s when the heart attack happened. He came back so pale and sick, so weak and thin, seeming so much older, and walking with a cane. This world of fantasy and artifice that I\'d known suddenly was about real life and death, about the potential loss of a parent. It didn\'t make any sense to me. It was enough to keep me away from acting for a long time."" - On his father\'s heart attack filming Apocalypse Now (1979).      ""If he\'s not getting something out of a performance, he\'ll come up and go, \'What are you, a faggot from Malibu? Were you playing too much fucking volleyball on the beach growing up?\' He once said that my reaction in a shot was comparable to a \'bad Mark Hamill moment.\' I said, \'Oliver, I\'ll take that as a compliment. Star Wars was one of my favorite movies.\' - On Oliver Stone.      My father gave me some pretty bad advice - keep it honest, which I did. People ask, why am I so honest with the press? I don\'t have an answer. I suppose I\'m honest everywhere else. Why should it stop here? Most of my shit sounds like lies. But all my stories are true, and that\'s the problem. They call me the last honest man in Hollywood. But I care what people think, we all do.      It\'s hard to be specific about what parts I may have lost. But ultimately, it\'s what I\'m known for.      Public speaking is a tremendous fear of mine. The Tonight Show (1962), David Letterman. I would always do a few shots or take an anti-whatever, some prescription relaxation deal and go out there and just kind of just flow with it.      I don\'t know. I want to go home at the end of the day and feel like I left a certain part of myself behind. You watch a Pacino performance, a DeNiro performance, you sit back in wonder and watch what they did. I\'m curious as to what it would take for me to get to that place.      There is a fine line between confidence and cockiness. And when you lose sight of what side you\'re walking on, that\'s when you are in trouble.      ""I didn\'t feel it would be any fun. I don\'t feel connected to basketball. At least, when I do a baseball movie, I know I\'m gonna have a good time."" - On why he turned down Woody Harrelson\'s part in White Men Can\'t Jump (1992).      ""I didn\'t want to have my wife in the movie snatched by Robert Redford. Besides, to show, in the end, that the million dollars didn\'t mean anything to the guy by having him buy at an auction an elephant, or whatever the fuck it was, for a million bucks? I mean, the millionaire\'s already jammed your wife, man, keep the cash!"" - On why he turned down Woody Harrelson\'s part in Indecent Proposal (1993).      ""I guess I went a little nuts. But I knew I didn\'t want to be at the (movie) premiere with 500 people 6 months down the line, embarrassed by my physical condition. So I developed a program that was Olympic in its intensity. Eight hours a day, six days a week, combining martial arts, yoga, weight lifting, running, swimming, and stationary bike. I went to Maui \'cause I had to be in tropical climate to burn the fat. I brought my chef who had the difficult task of preparing three meals a day with no salt, no fat, no red meat, no cholesterol, and still keeping it interesting, you know? Maybe a plate of steam for breakfast."" - On how (and why) he got so muscular and fit for the Rambo sequence in Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993).      I did that garbage film with my brother (Men at Work (1990)) That didn\'t work. I did an action movie Navy Seals (1990). That didn\'t work. I did a buddy cop picture (The Rookie (1990)) with Clint Eastwood. I figured that one was a shoo-in. It was an honor to work with Clint. I don\'t know what happened. I must have caught him one movie to early. Not to make excuses, but 600,000 of Clint\'s biggest fans were in the Persian Gulf fighting a war when The Rookie (1990) came out. That\'s a poor excuse for a flop, isn\'t it?      ""I was just tired - and sick and tired of being sick and tired, of living like a vampire."" - On qutting drinking.      ""Paula is a sweet lady and a great addition to the family. I\'m not really familiar with her music, and I\'ve said this to her face. We had a party at the house for my sister, Renee, and (my) Dad said, \'Charlie, put on some Paula Abdul, I don\'t own any of her records\'. So I replied, \'I\'ve been playing them so much, they\'re all worn out, they scratch and skip all over the place it would be an embarrassment\'. Paula didn\'t buy it for an instant."" - 1993 quote, during the time Paula Abdul was married to his brother Emilio Estevez.      ""Maybe for me and my peers, we\'ve gotten a lot of power too quickly. I\'m not a celebrity. I don\'t sing or dance, so I act. All the public sees is the autograph signing and the sunglasses. They don\'t see the 16-hour days, the last-minute rewrites and the hell that goes into movies."" (1989 Quote)      ""Three for the Road (1987) was a piece of shit that I wished didn\'t exist and that I was terrible in"".      I\'m very fortunate in that I like people or I\'d probably be in jail right now. It takes more time explaining why you can\'t give an autograph, which is usually bullshit, than to just do it. I like to sign autographs of pictures because you\'re giving people something back for supporting you. Somewhere down the line somebody may think you treated them well and buy a ticket to your film.      ""I collect guns and shoot them regularly. It\'s all purely recreational shooting, I believe in the right to bear arms. I\'m beside myself on the banning of the semi- automatic assault rifle. Guns don\'t kill people, people do. I don\'t carry a gun, but I respect them. I always take a gun on location because you never know. "" (1989)      All actors want to be athletes, and all athletes want to make movies. It\'s a strange situation when I meet up with a baseball player -- one of my heroes -- and all he wants to talk about is movies and all I want to talk about is baseball. To this day I cannot accept the fact that baseball players are as interested in what I do as I am in what they do. So I\'m making movies -- big deal! They\'re playing major league baseball. That\'s the ultimate. They\'re in \'The Show\'. I know I\'m in the entertainment business, but it\'s not like facing Rob Dibble or Nolan Ryan, where you have to come through on the spot. If I screw up a line, well, I get as many takes as I need to nail the sucker. If it means 10 takes, fine. But if a hitter goes 1 for 10 it\'s another story -- he\'s only batting .100, and that\'s not going to cut it in the bigs.      ""The bad part is that there\'s a lot of waiting, a lot of sitting around, a lot of down time. It\'s hard to keep the energy level up. We\'re all human and it\'s just impossible."" - On film acting.      She was a sweet girl, but when she grew up I started to have a crush on her which lasts to this day. I also chose her film name. She was known as Horowitz and I said she should change it. We were listening to a lot of Doors music, including the tracks Riders On The Storm, and I said she should change her name to Rider with a Y. The next thing, she\'s Winona Ryder. No one believes me, but that\'s the truth.      ""There was a time when I couldn\'t leave the house until I\'d smoked three joints, taken tranquilisers and drunk a bottle of Bourbon. So this is my last chance to get things right. People usually go into my sort of therapy for a month then come out and slowly try to adjust their lives. The fact that I\'m in for five months shows how much work I\'ve had to do."" (1999)      If I\'ve learned anything at all, it\'s that I know nothing about women. They remain a mystery. But I\'ve learned to stop trying to figure them out. There\'s no end to the journey, and that\'s what makes it so compelling.      The hardest were those first 30 days sober. Then, three months and six months. But if I compare the amount of time I\'ve been sober to the amount of time I\'ve partied, well, let\'s just say I\'ve still got a lot of catching up to do. Staying sober is the most important thing in my life, along with my family and loved ones. The movies, TV, money and all the other crap is just secondary.      I don\'t really hang out with a lot of people anymore. In the past I always had to surrounded myself with a crowd. Today, I just don\'t need it. But while my life might seem dull to some, it\'s exciting to me. That\'s because through my sobriety, I\'m finally able to enjoy a level of serenity that I\'ve witnessed in other people but never had myself. And that kind of self-contentment can\'t be purchased or acquired. It has to be earned. I\'m trying to earn it. Everyday.      The only thing I didn\'t do was shoot heroin. When I was ten years old, I told myself that I\'d never do heroin because one of two things would happen -- I\'d do it once and die or I\'d do it once and then do it every day for the rest of my life. I guess I should have made that same decision about all the other drugs.      I still want just one at-bat in the Major Leagues. Just one. I\'ll take it over an Oscar. Then, I\'m in the Baseball Encyclopedia. Forever. Forever. Even if I strike or walk.      I have 12 tattoos, and I wish I hadn\'t gotten so many now. It\'s hard when you have to take your shirt off two hours in make-up and it doesn\'t cover them.      I drank, toward the end, two or three bottles of vodka a day. I wouldn\'t drink the whole day; I\'d drink about every hour and a half. A big water glass full of vodka. That would get me through the next couple of hours.      ""I nearly died, which is about as bad as you can get. I\'m totally convinced that drugs and alcohol brought me very close to death two or three times, and it\'s more luck than anything else that I\'m still alive. My spirit was dying and I believe when your spirit dies, it\'s only a matter of time before your body follows."" - On his near fatal drug overdose.      ""It was a rough time for me. I was living that New York nightlife. Fame had arrived, it was a fresh thing and everybody was my best friend. It didn\'t matter if I had a 6 A.M. call, as long as the bar was serving until 4 A.M. I was there. I had to learn to do more than just try to make it to lunch. Fortunately, I realized that I\'ve got a job a million other guys would die for and the responsibility to the money-paying public to give it my best shot."" - On filming Wall Street (1987).      ""In sobriety they teach you to think the drink through. Don\'t just think about having the drink and how good it\'s going to feel. Think through to the next morning, how it\'s going to influence you, the shame, how it\'s going to trigger the domino effect. If I do that I end up with, OK, I\'m not going to drink. It\'s the same thing with one-night stands. I appreciate my time in the mornings so much that I\'d rather go to bed at night alone than deal with waking up, creeping around the bedroom, being quiet, worrying. Also, I\'d like to be with somebody I care about. Something moderately substantial."" - Quote from 2001.      Sometimes it\'s work, sometimes it\'s that something extra. I\'m not going to lie to you, there are times you show up on the set and have two lines, and you simply walk through. It\'s just work. Then there are certain scenes and moments, based on the intensity or intent of what you\'re trying to pull off, that call for more of an all- out effort. That\'s when you bring out your best.      One of my fondest memories is when Slash, from Guns N\' Roses, sat me down at his house and said, \'You\'ve got to clean up your act.\' You know you\'ve gone too far when Slash is saying, \'Look, you\'ve got to get into rehab, you have to shut it down. You\'re going to die.\' He\'s a terrific guy and I love him, he\'s a buddy of mine, but I had to step back from that situation and go, \'Yeah, but you\'re Slash. Whaddya mean?\' We\'d been up for about four days. But I still heard him because a part of me was saying, \'This isn\'t as much fun as I thought it was going to be. Something\'s missing.\'      Fame is a fickle mistress. It\'s very deceiving. It looks really bitchin\' from the outside, and then you get it and it\'s very confusing professionally, socially, emotionally. It\'s confusing because you\'re so worried about how you\'re perceived. A lot of my exploits were guilt-driven, shame-driven. I would hang out with the lower- class individual and try to give away as much as possible, because on some level I felt like I hadn\'t really earned all I had, and when was everyone going to find out? When would the curtain be yanked back? And all this because one day I was a working actor, just trying to pursue something I enjoyed and trying to make a living, and the next day I was a commodity.      You see, my brother [Emilio Estevez] didn\'t go as nuts as I did when he started getting that first taste of it all. I just thought that\'s what you\'re supposed to do. You become a fucking overnight success and suddenly everything\'s free. Everybody wants to be your best friend. It\'s amazing and dangerous: The more money you make, the more things people want to give you for free. It should be the opposite. It\'s very easy to get caught up with that fast life. Once you understand that you have to pay your way, you begin to handle your success and life.      ""He brings a reality to his work that\'s beyond what is required, and I think it takes the audience to another place. He tortures himself doing it, but God bless him, because that work exists forever. It\'s educational, watching his stuff. He teaches us about taking risks and about letting go of self, of celebrity, ego and all that crap we hang on to in front of the camera. Sean just says, \'That\'s not what I\'m here for.\' "" - On Sean Penn.      ""You can go to the best restaurant in town with no reservation, at peak mealtime with seven friends, and say, \'We\'re hungry.\' Then you could leave that meal, call a guy on the way to the airport to fire up a jet to take you to Vegas, go to a casino with nothing -no wallet, nothing and talk a casino manager into giving you a $50,000 line of credit."" - On the lifestyle you can have as a young, hot movie star.      ""I remember thinking and feeling and believing that I was not able to stop, that I genuinely was incapable of putting an end to this. It wasn\'t even that I didn\'t know what to do with myself if I could stop. I didn\'t take the thought that far. It was, \'My God, I can\'t stop. Now what?\' Not, \'OK, if I stop?\' That was a terribly sad reality."" - On his drug and alcohol abuse.      At age 16. I was arrested for possession of marijuana. Then I was arrested again a year later for this five-day crime spree, where I\'d go to the Beverly Hills Hotel and tell people that I\'d been a guest and lost my term paper. They\'d let me look through the trash, where I\'d find all these credit-card receipts and use the numbers to make phone orders.      ""Yeah, I\'d get an eye tuck or a chin tuck. A lot of my job is how you look."" - On if he would ever consider plastic surgery.      ""I\'d never smoked but Oliver wanted me to smoke in the film. \'Better start early,\' he said. \'That way you won\'t be sick when we\'re shooting.\' So I did. And now I find it hard to stop. I guess you pay a price for everything."" (LA Times December 1986)      There is such a thing as too much fun. It gets redundant. How many times can you wake up and struggle to remember your name, her name and where you are?      ""At first it was about really living that lifestyle that I had envisioned, that I had really hoped for. I\'d hoped to be a very recognizable celebrity. I thought thats what it was all about: the women, money, the fame, all the the bull****. When you get in it when you\'re suddenly in the eye of the storm, its not as good as it looks like from the outside. Its not as appealing as it looked when I would hang out with Emilio or Tom (Cruise) or Judd (Nelson) the guys who were going through it when I was still on my way up."" (SV Entertainment 1991)      ""There is this one tabloid reporter I know. She gets some germ of a rumor and expounds on it. She just goes nuts. I finally called and a asked what her problem was. She said, Well, honey, we are trying to create this bad-boy image for you, and it sells issues.I tried to reason with her by asking how she would feel if she was the target of those stories. Basically, she told me that the newspaper was trying to perpetuate a James Dean image for me. I lost it and said, Lady, James Dean died at 24, and that\'s not the image I want. It made no difference. They are hopeless."" (Penthouse 1993)      I\'m personally trying to change my image and change things about myself but they don\'t want to let it die. I guess there are more sales in controversy. They should change the title of \'Hard Copy\' to Hard Charlie or Sheen Copy, Christ I\'m on there twice a week I should get some royalties maybe. Are there so few things going on out there that my birthday party made news? Just a couple days ago on Hard Copy they said I had a nice birthday party and my parents and everybody was there , a good family night, a sober night. They said, \'but the real party took place the next day when Charlie Sheen and all his buddies had a roomful of strippers and porn stars and there were adult film stars on all the monitors in every room of the house\', I\'m thinking \'No this is absolute madness I was at my house watching football with my friends!\' I\'ve got twenty witnesses.      It seems to me like nineteen amateurs with box-cutters taking over four commercial airliners and hitting seventy-five per cent of their targets, that feels like a conspiracy theory. It raises a lot of questions. A couple of years ago, it was severely unpopular to talk about any of this. It feels like from the people I talk to, and the research I\'ve done and around my circles, it feels like the worm is turning. Just show us how this particular plane pulled off these maneuvers ... It is up to us to reveal the truth. It is up to us because we owe it to the families, we owe it to the victims, we owe it to everyone\'s life who was drastically altered, horrifically, that day and forever. We owe it to them to uncover what happened. - On the September 11th attacks.      I\'m tired of pretending I\'m not a total bitchin\' rock star from Mars.      I am on a drug, it\'s called Charlie Sheen. It\'s not available because if you try it you will die. Your face will melt off and your children will weep over your exploded body.      Ambien. Hello. Ambien. Hello. The devil\'s aspirin? That was the one thing in New York that was not part of my normal blend.

[2011, on hooking up with random women during the making of Major League (1989)] It wasn\'t as bad as on Young Guns (1988). We made that one in Santa Fe, and you would fly into Albuquerque and drive to Santa Fe on this two-lane highway. Literally, the girls that were leaving would pass the ones coming in. Major League (1989) was so physically demanding that you didn\'t have a lot of time for that. You\'re lying in bed and everything [hurts], and you\'re thinking, I have to pitch tomorrow?! But there were certain days that we\'d look at the schedule for the next day and be like, \'Gentlemen, tonight we ride.\'      [on being told that Charlie Harper\'s exit on Two and a Half Men (2003) will be his death] I have always been told that I have nine lives, so it\'s going to be amazing to witness my own funeral, which is clearly a win-win situation, because Ashton [Kutcher] has given me a tenth.      (2012, on his foot fetish) I\'ve not dated girls because of their feet, just the length of certain toes and the shape of where things should be and they\'re not. Hammertoes are bad. And the second toe being too long? That\'s bad, too.      (2012, on being off the wagon) I mean, the shit works. Sorry, but it works. Anyway, I don\'t see what\'s wrong with a few drinks.

I mean, how does a guy who\'s obviously quicksanded, how does he consider any of it a victory? I was in total denial.      I mean, how does fucking Francis Ford Coppola, one of the greatest filmmakers of our time, see Keanu Reeves\'s work, see what we\'ve all seen, and say, \'That\'s what I want in my movie\'? How does Bertolucci see that and say, \'That\'s my guy\'? Emilio and I sit around and just scratch our fucking heads, thinking, \'How did this guy get in?\' I mean, what the fuck?

He is the eldest son of actor Martin Sheen, who at the time was just breaking into the business. His mother, Janet Sheen (née Templeton), was a former New York art student who had met Emilio\'s father right after he had moved to Manhattan. Martin and Janet had three other children, Charlie Sheen, Renée Estevez, and Ramon Estevez, all of whom became actors. His father is of half Spanish and half Irish descent, and his mother, whose family is from Kentucky, has English and Scottish ancestry.He lived on Manhattan\'s Upper West Side until his family relocated to Malibu in 1968. Before graduating from Santa Monica High School in 1980, Estevez had already had a small role as a messenger boy in Apocalypse Now (1979), that was ultimately cut from the film.Though his father had opted to use the stage name ""Sheen"" over his more ethnic birth name ""Estevez,"" Emilio chose to retain the family name, hoping to avoid riding his father\'s coattails. He also thought the double ""E"" set of initials was ""pretty.""He appeared in a few TV movies, the first of which was Seventeen Going on Nowhere (1980), before making his big-screen debut opposite Matt Dillon in 1982\'s Tex (1982). A part in The Outsiders (1983) followed, and Estevez made his first big splash as the punk rocker Otto in the cult classic Repo Man (1984).Originally cast as Bender (The Criminal) in the seminal John Hughes flick The Breakfast Club (1985), Estevez took the part of Andrew (The Athlete) instead after Hughes could find no one else to fill the role. Another ensemble film, St. Elmo\'s Fire (1985) came next. Then Estevez made his screen-writing debut with That Was Then... This Is Now (1985), a film in which he also starred.He then starred in the Stephen King thriller Maximum Overdrive (1986), but the film was a failure. The ambitious young actor added directing to his palette with Wisdom (1987) in 1986, but the film was universally panned and struck out at the box office. Estevez quickly rebounded with hits like Stakeout (1987) and Young Guns (1988), as well as their subsequent sequels. He tried his hand at directing again with Men at Work (1990) before taking on one of his most famous roles as Coach Gordon Bombay in The Mighty Ducks (1992). The enormously popular Disney film spawned sequels and an NHL hockey team of the same name, but Estevez was interested in making weighter films.He agreed to make a brief appearance in D3: The Mighty Ducks (1996) in exchange for Disney helping him finance and distribute another effort as actor-director, The War at Home (1996). Though smiled on by critics, The War at Home (1996) received a paltry distribution by Disney and thus went largely unseen. A devastated Estevez considered quitting the business but has ultimately continued to work in films, including a fourth effort as director and star, Rated X (2000), which co-starred brother Charlie Sheen and was a selection at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2006, Bobby (2006), a film about the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy that Estevez wrote, directed, and acted in, premiered at the Venice Film Festival and received a seven-minute standing ovation.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Azure_Girl          Spouse (1) Paula Abdul (29 April\xa01992            - 1994)\xa0(divorced)          Trade Mark (4)        Has a unique laugh, prominently featured in his role as Billy the Kid in the ""Young Guns"" franchise.        As a film director, he frequently casts members of his family in various roles. Prominent among these are his brother, Charlie Sheen, and his father, Martin Sheen.        As a film director, he often puts the most focus on the characters rather than the plot itself.        Frequently deals with social issues in his films (ex. returning soldiers in The War at Home (1996), the Civil Rights Movement in Bobby (2006), caring for the homeless in The Public).Trivia (22)      Was once engaged to Demi Moore.

Engaged to journalist Sonja Magdevski [September 5, 2006].      Almost went broke while writing the screenplay for Bobby (2006).      Because of writers block while writing the script for Bobby (2006), his brother Charlie Sheen suggested he change his surroundings. Estevez drove about 150 miles north of Los Angeles and randomly chose a motel to spend the night. While talking about his project with the woman working the front desk, she revealed she was actually in the ballroom the night Robert Kennedy was shot.      Both Emilio and brother Charlie Sheen have played the son of real father Martin Sheen; Emilio in both The War at Home (1996) and The Way (2010) (which Emilio also wrote and directed), and Charlie in Wall Street (1987) and two episodes of Spin City (1996).      Reportedly, as a child he did not get along with younger brother, Charlie Sheen, at all - in fact, they fought constantly.      Was originally set to play the lead in Oliver Stone\'s Platoon (1986), but when production shut down for two years, he moved on to other projects. The role then went to his brother Charlie Sheen. He was later cast in Stone\'s doomed project ""Jawbreaker"".      Makes wine in his own vineyard.

Additionally, Estevez guest-starred on Charlie Sheen\'s TV sitcom ""Two and a Half Men"" (2003).Personal Quotes (10)      What\'s the level of compromise for making that kind of money? How far do I have to sell my soul? What\'s the price of that? And I don\'t know if I want to make those kind of compromises any more. I think I\'m a different person. I think I\'ve matured to a great extent. I think that I want different things now. That it\'s not about the celebrity status that you receive because you\'re doing the next hot movie. It\'s about doing good work.      If Hollywood gives you a break and it gives you stardom, then it can take it away. If you earn it, it can\'t take it away.      I spent a lot of my life traveling and I knew that\'s where I got most of my education, not in school.      Writing is a lonely job, unless you\'re a drinker, in which case you always have a friend within reach.      The most significant thing my father has taught me is that my job is no more or less important than someone else\'s. When I realize there are a billion people in China who don\'t know I exist, any flightiness is swept away.      ""People come up to me on the street and say, \'Men at Work (1990) is the funniest movie I ever saw in my life\'. But, you know, I do have to question how many movies these people have seen"".      I used to Google my name to see what came up - it hurt.      I swore to myself that I\'d make it through drive, ambition and hard work. I wanted to know I got it that way and not because of my bloodlines. And I think there is no question why I got where I am today. I\'m pretty content. I have a motto: expect nothing and be pleasantly surprised.      I grew up in a house where my mother was a strict Southern Baptist, and my father was a devout Catholic. I grew up as a kid hearing many arguments about religion. There was always a question about how we would be raised. We were baptized, and as often happens in these types of situations, the father loses the fight. Because of the turmoil, going to Mass was not part of our routine... For me, I\'m a work in progress [religiously] and I really feel that I\'m on a journey. I have yet to declare myself.      [on Repo Man (1984)] The studio really tried to bury the film.

[on Gargoyles (1994)] I was very moved by Goliath. I was moved by playing him. They\'re not displaced citizens but they are citizens from another time and another place that were placed in this modern context and maintained that integrity.      You get to celebrate the content of someone\'s character as opposed to the color of their skin or their outward appearance. That to me is the most impressive element about Gargoyles (1994) because it forces you to deal with who they are. Not what they look like or anything external. You are dealing with internal principles about these people.      I don\'t think they\'re going to pay me to play Mufasa.      I came out singing, the doctor slapped me on the head, and I started singing.      I am working on my nightclub act, definitely want to do more singing.      But Gargoyles, bar none, is the most fun I\'ve ever had in life.      And it has some weight, I mean, the whole history of the gargoyles, that\'s some wonderful stuff.      What has been happening more lately - of course, I also put in my bio, I say I do the voice of Goliath, but some people go - you know, I say something, and it\'s a funny thing when you work in this business, people will talk out loud in front of you like you\'re not there.      Well, you know, I played Mufasa in the workshop of The Lion King.      My whole life, I always wanted to be an actor.      It can\'t hurt, publicity is publicity, controversy and all that, it\'s all good.      In fact, I have never met anyone who didn\'t like Gargoyles.

People who dismiss this as juvenile humor or another stupid buddy comedy are
totally off the target. Emilio Estevez's screenplay is quite an intelligent
story with a number of colorful characters. Real-life brothers Estevez and
Charlie Sheen have EXCELLENT chemistry together - their comic timing is
perfect, and the scenes where they're just hanging out, talking about their
plans to open a surf shop are a true highlight.<br><br>Another true highlight is Keith David. This is, without a doubt, his finest
performance captured on film. Playing the rough boss's brother-in-law Louis,
who is employed to keep a watch on the mischevious garbagemen pals, David is
just perfect. Hearing him lecture about ""another man's fries"", his Vietnam
days ""in the jungle"", and his speech to the cops are just all priceless
moments. It's one of the funniest marriages of actor and role - and Mr.
David just plays it all so well. Watch him snap at the pizza man who's ""seen
too much.""<br><br>All in all, ""Men at Work"" is a delightful, crowd-pleasing comedy that is
able to make me laugh far more than the types of films that are heralded as
""excellent comedies"" like ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Annie Hall."" Give me this
any day.<br><br>And Charlie, you may put this down...but in all honesty, this is your finest
work to date, even ahead of comedic roles in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and
the two very good ""Major League"" movies. It's lightyears better than the low
points of ""Spin City"", too.<br><br>""Men at Work"" is highly recommended, and is one of many films on IMDb whose
low rating you can completely disregard. Or don't disregard it, but then
you'll just be even more pleasantly surprised by the ensuing
hilarity.

This somehow forgotten movie is pretty funny by todays standard.Not
that the comedies today are that smart really... Brothers Sheen has
nice chemistry together and delivers many funny and memorable
dialogues.A hoot is also Vietnam-vet Keith David,this guy is one bad
dude...You've seen this before,but the script is not that bad and the
movie moves along in a pleasant pace.The villains are also portrayed as
idiots and the cops as smart asses,who will get what they deserve by
time. This is easy entertainment and you don't remember it for that
long,but it's a pleasant journey while it lasts-just don't think too
much.

A very funny film, which most people who saw it when it first hit video
stores will agree.  Watching it years later it holds up very well indeed,
Emilio and Charlie as Carl and James, are clearly having great fun working
together and this chemistry heightens the comedy.  Our 2 favourite binmen
(garbage men)go about their job with a relaxed attitude to working and
ultimately pursue their dreams of running a surf shop.  A personal

In his directorial debut, Estevez directs self and brother Charlie
Sheen in a small budget comedy about two garbage men (sanitary
technicians) who come along the dead body of a local politician on
their route. Mayhem follows them as they try to find the killer on
their own instead of going to the police, who are looking to bust our
two unsuspecting heroes. Estevez does a good job for a beginning
director and doesn't try to overdo it. Sheen and Estevez are good, not
great, together as they were in 'Young Guns'. Keith David is the solid
part of the movie, his portrayal as the 'ex-military' Viet Nam Veteran,
asked to baby sit garbage men carries the movie with his unpredictable
cop hating nature. Leslie Hope is very nice to look at and give credit
to Estevez, makes her character a strong one, not a helpless female as
women once were portrayed in movies. Movie has given me much enjoyment
over the years as my children enjoyed playing garbage men around the
house in their younger days.

Are you looking for perfectly structured Mise-en-Scene? How about eloquent
dialogue and acting?? No? Neither am I when I sit down and watch a comedy
about two looser garbage men played by the Estevez brothers. This flick is
what it is, and in that respect, it's amazing. Sure, the last 25mins are
total garbage, but what comes before has me and my friends rolling on the
floor in hysterics. Here's these two idiots, they seem to have no friends
besides themselves, and their relations with women appear to consist of the
odd peep into their windows or occasional stalking. They suck at their job,
and have the local cops hating them for what appears to be a variety of
reasons we are not privy to. What flows within this basic framework is a
ridiculous 'adventure' in which the boys attempt to solve a local crime and
avoid a murder rap by dragging a dead body around ala 'Weekend at Bernie's"".
Add to the mix the always amazing Keith David, playing an insane Vietnam vet
who is charged with monitoring their activities on the job, but only ends up
being crazier than the ?Sheens? ever could be (""Never, EVER, touch another
man's fries""). The antics reach a fever pitch when David's character kidnaps
the Pizza Boy played by that dude who played 'Chainsaw"" in ""Summer School"".
Eventually the dead body dons a Nixon mask, and the traditional ""we couldn't
think of a funny ending, so here's some lame action sequence"" ensues (See
""D.C. Cab). I usually stop the film here. You don't need to finish 'Men at
Work' to love it. The pratical jokes, the memories of Da-Nang, and of course
the infamous Pellet gun, make the first hour worth every minute. A comedy
classic ... at least I think so.

Its funny how some people try hard to capture images and moments of REAL
LIFE in a film.  Most try too hard.  I can remember watching this film as
a
kid.  I would rent it from the rental store every other week or so, i
still
dont know how i got started.
Although its jokes are pretty bad, the acting is sub-par, and the
behavior
of every character is overly juvenile for a group of adults, there is
something relaxed about the whole movie.  The cast is very good,
including
Keith David as Louis (one of my favs), and a number of other goofy
cliqued
characters, like the hitmen, the crooked business exec, the uptight
leading
lady, and the comedic garbage buddies, Carl and James (Sheen and

Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez star as two garbagemen on the road to
nowhere. One night, in Carl's (Sheen) apartment, they see a confrontation
between a couple across the street. Carl shoots him with a pellet gun
after
he sees the man push the woman. What he doesn't see after that is two men
go
into the apartment and kill the man, put his body in a garbage can, and
leave. Carl and James then find the body the next day on their garbage
route. Then all hell breaks loose as they try to find the killer. Very
funny
movie!!

People who dismiss this as juvenile humor or another stupid buddy comedy are
totally off the target. Emilio Estevez's screenplay is quite an intelligent
story with a number of colorful characters. Real-life brothers Estevez and
Charlie Sheen have EXCELLENT chemistry together - their comic timing is
perfect, and the scenes where they're just hanging out, talking about their
plans to open a surf shop are a true highlight.<br><br>Another true highlight is Keith David. This is, without a doubt, his finest
performance captured on film. Playing the rough boss's brother-in-law Louis,
who is employed to keep a watch on the mischevious garbagemen pals, David is
just perfect. Hearing him lecture about ""another man's fries"", his Vietnam
days ""in the jungle"", and his speech to the cops are just all priceless
moments. It's one of the funniest marriages of actor and role - and Mr.
David just plays it all so well. Watch him snap at the pizza man who's ""seen
too much.""<br><br>All in all, ""Men at Work"" is a delightful, crowd-pleasing comedy that is
able to make me laugh far more than the types of films that are heralded as
""excellent comedies"" like ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Annie Hall."" Give me this
any day.<br><br>And Charlie, you may put this down...but in all honesty, this is your finest
work to date, even ahead of comedic roles in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and
the two very good ""Major League"" movies. It's lightyears better than the low
points of ""Spin City"", too.<br><br>""Men at Work"" is highly recommended, and is one of many films on IMDb whose
low rating you can completely disregard. Or don't disregard it, but then
you'll just be even more pleasantly surprised by the ensuing
hilarity.

This somehow forgotten movie is pretty funny by todays standard.Not
that the comedies today are that smart really... Brothers Sheen has
nice chemistry together and delivers many funny and memorable
dialogues.A hoot is also Vietnam-vet Keith David,this guy is one bad
dude...You've seen this before,but the script is not that bad and the
movie moves along in a pleasant pace.The villains are also portrayed as
idiots and the cops as smart asses,who will get what they deserve by
time. This is easy entertainment and you don't remember it for that
long,but it's a pleasant journey while it lasts-just don't think too
much.

A very funny film, which most people who saw it when it first hit video
stores will agree.  Watching it years later it holds up very well indeed,
Emilio and Charlie as Carl and James, are clearly having great fun working
together and this chemistry heightens the comedy.  Our 2 favourite binmen
(garbage men)go about their job with a relaxed attitude to working and
ultimately pursue their dreams of running a surf shop.  A personal
favourite

            ","

Felix Farmer is an extremely successful Hollywood producer, whose movies for Capitol Pictures have never lost money,... until now, with his latest, most expensive film to date, Night Wind, ending up being a major flop. The film, starring his popular Academy Award winning actress wife, Sally Miles, who has a G-rated screen image, almost bankrupts the studio. As such, the studio execs turn on Felix, who want to take over creative control of the movie and re-edit it to lessen the damage. It also turns Felix suicidal, his mental state which in turn leads to Sally leaving him and taking their two children with her. As Felix tries and tries again unsuccessfully to kill himself, he finally stumbles upon an idea which gets him out of his depression. He plans to use his and Sally's money to purchase the movie back from the studio, and re-imagine it by adding a few new scenes, to drastically altar it from the G-rated fantasy film it is, to an R-rated sex romp, complete with Sally baring her ...

Her mother, Barbara Ward (Morris), and stepfather, both vaudeville performers, discovered her freakish but undeniably lovely four-octave singing voice and immediately got her a singing career. She performed in music halls throughout her childhood and teens, and at age 20, she launched her stage career in a London Palladium production of ""Cinderella"".Andrew came to Broadway in 1954 with ""The Boy Friend"", and became a bona fide star two years later in 1956, in the role of Eliza Doolittle in the unprecedented hit ""My Fair Lady"". Her star status continued in 1957, when she starred in the TV-production of Cinderella (1957) and through 1960, when she played ""Guenevere"" in ""Camelot"".In 1963, Walt Disney asked Andrews if she would like to star in his upcoming production, a lavish musical fantasy that combined live-action and animation. She agreed on the condition if she didn\'t get the role of Doolittle in the pending film production of My Fair Lady (1964). After Audrey Hepburn was cast in My Fair Lady, Andrews made an auspicious film debut in Walt Disney\'s Mary Poppins (1964), which earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress.Andrews continued to work on Broadway, until the release of The Sound of Music (1965), the highest-grossing movie of its day and one of the highest-grossing of all time. She soon found that audiences identified her only with singing, sugary-sweet nannies and governesses, and were reluctant to accept her in dramatic roles in The Americanization of Emily (1964) and Alfred Hitchcock\'s thriller Torn Curtain (1966). In addition, the box-office showings of the musicals Julie subsequently made increasingly reflected the negative effects of the musical-film boom that she helped to create. Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967) was for a time the most successful film Universal had released, but it still couldn\'t compete with Mary Poppins or The Sound of Music for worldwide acclaim and recognition. Star! (1968) and Darling Lili (1970) also bombed at the box office.Fortunately, Andrews did not let this keep her down. She worked in nightclubs and hosted a TV variety series in the 1970s. In 1979, Andrews returned to the big screen, appearing in films directed by her husband Blake Edwards, with roles that were entirely different from anything she had been seen in before. Andrews starred in 10 (1979), S.O.B. (1981) and Victor Victoria (1982), which earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role.She continued acting throughout the 1980s and 1990s in movies and TV, hosting several specials and starring in a short-lived sitcom. In 2001, she starred in The Princess Diaries (2001), alongside then-newcomer Anne Hathaway. The family film was one of the most successful G-Rated films of that year, and Andrews reprised her role as Queen Clarisse Renaldi in The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004). In recent years, Andrews appeared in Tooth Fairy (2010), as well as a number of voice roles in Shrek 2 (2004), Shrek the Third (2007), Enchanted (2007), Shrek Forever After (2010), and Despicable Me (2010).- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Tommy Peter and Volker Boehm          Spouse (2) Blake Edwards (12 November\xa01969            - 15 December\xa02010)\xa0(his death)\xa0(2 children)           Tony Walton (10 May\xa01959            - 14 November\xa01967)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)          Trade Mark (2)        Her 4-octave soprano voice        Her very regal mannerisms/behaviorTrivia (73)      Was named a Dame by Britain\'s Queen Elizabeth II on the Millenium New Year\'s Honours List on December 31, 1999.

Sinai Hospital doctors who allegedly botched her throat surgery was settled for an undisclosed sum.      The London press reported that Miss Andrews\'s settlement for her botched throat surgery was nearly 21 million British pounds, or about 30 million U.S. dollars. [2001]      While she played the original Eliza Dolittle in the Broadway musical ""My Fair Lady"", Audrey Hepburn played the part in the movie My Fair Lady (1964). The studio executives did not want Andrews because she hadn\'t had any experience in film and thought Hepburn would be the better choice. However, while the film My Fair Lady took home several Oscars in 1964, it failed to win the Best Actress category. That award went to none other than Julie Andrews for her performance in Mary Poppins (1964).      When Tony Walton proposed to her, he gave her a broach instead of a ring.      She has a rose named after her.      Has perfect pitch.      She was a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 2001.      In 2002, she was voted the 59th greatest Briton ever in a BBC poll.      Played the same role of ""Victoria Grant"" in the Broadway musical adaption of Victor Victoria (1982). She turned down a Tony nomination for Best Actress in a Musical.      Has owned a chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland, for many years. Every year she pays for Gstaad\'s Christmas lights. In July she presents the prize for the winner of the annual Gstaad Tennis Open. She once said if she was nervous before a performance on stage, she\'d just have to look at a photo from \'lovely\' Gstaad, and she was reassured.      In the 1960s she sported a bumper sticker on her car reading ""Mary Poppins is a junkie"".      In 1969, when MGM cancelled their proposed Irving Berlin musical biography ""Say it With Music"" in which she was set to star, she sued the studio and collected her $1,250,000 salary.Mary Poppins (1964) for Disney, The Sound of Music (1965) for 20th Century Fox and Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967) for Universal were the biggest money-makers yet for their studios. However, her next two films, Star! (1968) and Darling Lili (1970), to put it mildly, failed to get their money back.      Received a standing ovation at The 75th Annual Academy Awards (2003) when she appeared to present a short film celebration sequence.      Changed her last name from Wells to Andrews when her mother married her stepfather Ted Andrews.      Her stepfather was an alcoholic.      She adopted two children from Vietnam with Blake Edwards, Amy Edwards (b. 1974) and Joanna Edwards (b. 1975).      Was passed over for the role on Eliza Dolittle in favor of Audrey Hepburn for the film My Fair Lady (1964). Unlike Andrews, however, Hepburn was not a natural singer. She took voice lessons and recorded the tracks for the movie, but the producers, without telling Audrey, dubbed her voice with that of Marni Nixon. Nixon appeared with Andrews in The Sound of Music (1965).      Her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is directly in front of the new addition to the Chinese Theatre. The star was dedicated on 5 Oct, 1979.      Filmed a cameo sequence as a chambermaid in Blake Edwards\' 1975 Inspector Clouseau comedy The Return of the Pink Panther (1975), but the sequence ended up on the cutting-room floor.      Was selected by the Walt Disney Company to become the Offical Ambassador for ""The Happiest Homecoming On Earth: Disneyland\'s 50th Anniversary Celebration"".      Sings scales rather than songs in the shower.      She was the youngest person ever to appear in a Royal Command Performance. She performed for King George VI, Queen Elizabeth, Princess Elizabeth/Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret.      Her performance as Mary Poppins in Mary Poppins (1964) is ranked #45 on Premiere Magazine\'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.      Is the only actress to be nominated for (and later win) the Oscar in the Lead Actress category in a Walt Disney film (Mary Poppins (1964)).      Possessed a five-octave coloratura soprano range until a vocal nodule surgery mishap ruined her singing voice.

[1982] Does Mary Poppins have an orgasm? Does she go to the bathroom? I assure you, she does.      Singing has never been particularly easy for me.      Films are much more my level. On stage I never feel quite enough.      [upon answering whether Mary Poppins and Bert ever got it together]: I hope so. She wouldn\'t admit it, but I do hope so.      As my mother said, I never sprang out of bed with a glad shout! My voice needed oiling and then it took off.      I had a teacher who stressed for me the importance of diction in terms of - I want to be very careful about how I say this - in terms of supporting one\'s voice when one is singing. In other words, if you hold on to your words, your voice will pull through for you when you\'re singing. So be true to your vowels. Supposing you have to sing [from ""The Messiah""] ""Behold thy king cometh unto thee"". If you do a strong ""thee"", it will help you with the ""-hold"", which is a much higher note. And it\'s the note before the note that matters, then you unpeel a song backwards.      A lot of my life happened in great, wonderful bursts of good fortune, and then I would race to be worthy of it.      [on being a gay icon] I don\'t know. I\'m sort of aware that I am. But I\'m that odd mixture of, on the one hand, being a gay icon and, on the other hand, having grandmas and parents being grateful I\'m around to be a babysitter for their kids. And I\'ve never been able to figure out what makes a gay icon, because there are many different kinds. I don\'t think I have the image that, say, Judy Garland has, or Bette Davis.      [upon receiving the BAFTA award on October 7, 1989] I am first and always English, and I carry my country in my heart wherever I go. I\'ve tried to honour her, and I have the funny feeling that perhaps tonight, in some way, I\'ve managed to do just that.      [asked where she kept her Oscar] He stayed in the attic a long time. I just didn\'t feel worthy . . . When I got to know more about film, I felt safe trotting him out.      I\'ve learned things about myself through singing. I used to have a certain dislike of the audience, not as individual people, but as a giant body who was judging me. Of course, it wasn\'t really them judging me. It was me judging me. Once I got past that fear, it freed me up, not just when I was performing but in other parts of my life.Bette Davis was always marvelous.      As soon as you have one, all those dormant maternal instincts start popping out all over you, like German measles.      All love shifts and changes. I don\'t know if you can be wholeheartedly in love all the time.      Blake [husband Blake Edwards] and I have this wonderful arrangement that while one is working hard, the other tries to be at home as much as possible and vice versa.      All kinds of things have been printed, including much gossip and rumour and finally I feel ready to have my say. I want to be as honest as I can.      Sometimes I\'m so sweet even I can\'t stand it.      [on Max von Sydow] He was the unqualified front runner -- the most generous man I\'ve ever met. And he had such a lovely light sense of humor. I consider it a privilege to have worked with him.      With \'Star\' and \'Darling Lili\', it seemed that the big musicals weren\'t popular any more. I underwent a career dip. You know the Hollywood saying \'You\'re only as good as your last hit\'. Sometimes an enormous hit can carry you along, but not forever.      [on the 2015 celebrations honouring \'The Sound of Music\'] This is a lovely moment to mark. I\'ve been saying all long it\'s like a very bad joke because surely it\' was only thirty years ago - not fifty. I feel I lost twenty somewhere along the way.

He suffered a laceration to his forehead and bled to death, after he slipped on a throw rug and hit his head on a table. Claims that he was intoxicated at the time are disputed.      Adopted his stepdaughter, Virginia Holden (Virginia Gaines), from Ardis Ankerson\'s (Brenda Marshall\'s) first marriage. He and Marshall had two sons together, Peter Westfield ""West"" Holden, born November 17, 1943, and Scott Holden (Scott Porter Holden, born May 2, 1946.      Not to be confused with the character actor William Holden.Brian Donlevy was his best man when Holden married Brenda Marshall in 1941. A Congregationalist Church service was planned in Las Vegas. Since William and Brian were still filming The Remarkable Andrew (1942), there were delays and it was 3am before they arrived for the ceremony. By that time the minister had long gone to bed. It was 4pm Sunday before another preacher could be found to perform the wedding. After they were married, they had a champagne breakfast and hopped a plane back to Los Angeles so he and Brian could wrap up shooting, and Brenda was off to Canada to film some location footage that she was still working on. It would be three more months before they would have a real honeymoon (one mishap after another postponed it ... including the TWO of them having to undergo emergency appendectomies)!      He was very instrumental in animal preservation in Africa. In the 1970s he purchased a large acreage of land with his own money and began an animal sanctuary.

I was always hoping for the opportunity to play the gigolo for some wealthy woman. This is a song about identifying with that sort of compromised existence.""      Although it is thought by some that J.D. Salinger got the name for his hero Holden Caulfield in ""The Catcher in the Rye"" when he saw a marquee for Dear Ruth (1947), starring William Holden and Joan Caulfield, Salinger\'s first Holden Caulfield story, ""I\'m Crazy,"" appeared in Collier\'s on December 22, 1945, a year and a half before this movie came out.

Vega has subsequently expressed embarrassment at these lyrics.      Made two films with Audrey Hepburn: Sabrina (1954) and Paris - When It Sizzles (1964).      His younger brother, Robert Beedle, was actually a Navy fighter pilot who was killed in action in World War II, and after The Bridges at Toko-Ri (1954) was released, he was remembered by his squadron-mates as having been very much like Holden\'s character of Lt. Harry Brubaker in that movie.      Was an avid art collector. His private collection at his exclusive hilltop home in Palm Springs featured antique Asian art.

Holden was cast as Pike Bishop in The Wild Bunch (1969) after the role had been turned down by Lee Marvin, Burt Lancaster, James Stewart, Charlton Heston, Gregory Peck, Sterling Hayden, Richard Boone and Robert Mitchum. Marvin actually accepted the role but pulled out after he was offered a larger pay deal to star in Paint Your Wagon (1969).

In 1955, he was ranked #4, then hit #1 for the first and only time in 1956, and then dropped to #7 in 1957 before rebounding slightly to #6 in 1958. After five straight years in the Top 10, he dropped off the list in 1959 and 1960, but reappeared in the Top Ten in 1961, ranked in eighth place.

After seeing the film Mifune was working on at that time, Miyamoto Musashi (1954), Holden offered to distribute the film in America.

Was considered for the role of ""Maurice Novak"" in Career (1959).      Felt he didn\'t deserve the Academy Award for Best Actor for Stalag 17 (1953), and that the award should have gone to Burt Lancaster for From Here to Eternity (1953). His wife also felt that the honor was just a belated apology for snubbing his nomination for Sunset Blvd. (1950).Toward the Unknown (1956) was the only movie made by his production company, ""Toluca Productions"".      Holden acted with wife Brenda Marshall professionally for the only time in a ""Theater Guild on the Air"" production of ""The Lost Weekend."".

For a time in 1943, Holden shared an apartment in Ft. Worth, Texas with baseball superstar Hank Greenberg while both of them were serving stateside in WWII.Billy Wilder on Holden\'s death: ""If someone had said to me, \'Holden\'s dead,\' I would have assumed that he had been gored by a water buffalo in Kenya, that he had died in a plane crash approaching Hong Kong, that a crazed, jealous woman had shot him, and he drowned in a swimming pool. But to be killed by a bottle of vodka and a night table - what a lousy fade-out of a great guy!"".      ""Hollwood Reporter"" reported that Holden had signed to play the coach in That Championship Season (1982), but his death precluded that, and he was replaced by Robert Mitchum. Holden had also agreed to co-star with old friend Glenn Ford in ""Dime Novel Sunset"", which was never made.      Holden bequeathed $250,000 to girlfriend Stefanie Powers, $50,000 to former co-star Capucine, and $50,000 to socialite friend Patricia Stauffer.

He was quoted as saying that Fredric March and Spencer Tracy were his acting ideals.Personal Quotes (13)      For me, acting is not an all-consuming thing, except for the moment when I am actually doing it.      Take any picture you can. One out of four will be good, one out of ten will be very good, and one out of 15 will get you an Academy Award.      Movie acting may not have a certain kind of glory as true art, but it is damn hard work.      I don\'t really know why, but danger has always been an important thing in my life - to see how far I could lean without falling, how fast I could go without cracking up.      I\'m a whore, all actors are whores. We sell our bodies to the highest bidder.      [on Barbara Stanwyck] Thirty-nine years ago this month, we were working in a film together called Golden Boy (1939). It wasn\'t going so well and I was going to be replaced. But due to this lovely human being and her encouragement and above all her generosity, I\'m here tonight.      [on working with Clint Eastwood on Breezy (1973)] He\'s even-tempered -- a personality trait not much in evidence among directors. The crew is totally behind him and that really helps things go smoothly.      [on Humphrey Bogart] I hated that bastard.      I found the jungle a beautiful and fascinating place to be, I like to come here because I want to stay away from the jungle as much as I can.      I made Toward the Unknown (1956) as an actor by day and, by night, a caster, a cuter, and a producer. I\'ll never do anything like that again.      [on Toni Helfer and Ralph Helfer] Years after our initial meeting in Africa, I visited Ralph and Toni at Africa U.S.A. in Sangus, California, and there I was even more amazed at the rapport the two of them had with their wildlife. Toni is an absolutely fearless human being who is totally loved by every animal she has ever touched. She is undaunted by any endeavor or undertaking. A remarkable painter, naturalist, zoologist, conservationist, and now author. Toni Helfer has the courage and the curiosity we all should have. For the sake of the world I wish Ralph and Toni a long, rich, and productive life.      The other day I drove into the garage of my Palm Springs house with some groceries. Suddenly one of those tour buses pulled up and a voice said, ""This is William Holden\'s house, and I think I just saw him pull in."" I flattened myself against the garage wall - the garage was separate from the house - and tried to hide. But the bags got heavy so I finally thought to hell with it, and walked out. And the voice said, ""There he is, folks, I told you he\'d come out sooner or later.""      Let\'s face it, it\'s pretty difficult to kiss someone who is a stranger. I don\'t think anyone in movies enjoys playing a love scene. Kissing someone is an intimate act, and when you have to do it in front of other people it\'s not easy.Salary (7)Sunset Blvd.\xa0(1950)      $30,000       Sabrina\xa0(1954)      $150,000       The Bridge on the River Kwai\xa0(1957)      $250,000 + 10% of the gross (World-wide)      The Horse Soldiers\xa0(1959)      $750,000 + 20% of profits      The Counterfeit Traitor\xa0(1962)      $750,000       The Wild Bunch\xa0(1969)      $250,000       The Towering Inferno\xa0(1974)      $750,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nMarisa Berenson ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 24 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(2)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(2)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(16)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(3)  Overview (2)Date of Birth15\xa0February1947,\xa0New York City, New York, USA Height5\'\xa08""\xa0(1.73\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Marisa Berenson was born on February 15, 1947 in New York City, New York, USA.

His show Dallas (1978) was filmed at Southfork Ranch, the same place that is located in real-life.      At the beginning of the second season of the revised Dallas (2012) series, he reduced his appearances because he needed to undergo chemotherapy.      He appeared on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee (1988) five times.      His Dallas (1978) co-star, Ken Kercheval, said Hagman\'s character, JR Ewing was the total opposite of Hagman, in real-life.      Had guest-starred on the second episode of Dallas (1978)\'s spin-off series Knots Landing (1979), as JR Ewing.      Met Donna Mills on The Good Life (1971), where the two remained best friends for 41 years until Hagman\'s death in 2012.      His ex-Dallas (1978) co-star and friend Joan Van Ark attended his 80th birthday party in 2011, despite not being a regular castmember.      His parents were Mary Martin, who was a popular Broadway actress and Benjamin Hagman, a lawyer.      A cowboy buff.      His parents were divorced when he was only 5 years old.      While temporarily moving back to Connecticut with his mother and stepfather, Hagman continued drinking heavily again, therefore, Mary Martin had no choice other than to kick him out of the house much due to the fact that Hagman was suffering from alcohol poisoning.      Was reunited with ex-I Dream of Jeannie (1965) co-star, Barbara Eden on both series: A Howling in the Woods (1971) and Dallas (1978).      His family moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1938, when young Larry was only 7.      Began his career appearing in Broadway plays and musicals in 1950.      Had worked with Joan Van Ark in episodes of two different series: Dallas (1978) and its spin-off Knots Landing (1979).      In order for Hagman to get the role of Maj. Anthony Nelson in I Dream of Jeannie (1965), he did the voice-over in Russian for the show The Rogues (1964). He was also convinced to get the role when Gig Young was unavailable, hence, Hagman won the role.      Was also a solar power enthusiast.      Before he was a successful actor, he met and used to work with a young unfamiliar actor Carroll O\'Connor, who was working as an assistant stage manager for the Broadway play \'God and Kate Murphy,\' in which Hagman starred.      Before he was a successful actor, he used to dance with Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O\'Hara, on the opening night of South Pacific at the Savoy in London, England.      His show Dallas (1978) was canceled at the end of the fourteenth season because of low ratings.      He was not David Jacobs\'s first choice to audition for the male lead role of J.R. Ewing on Dallas (1978), when Robert Foxworth had been offered the role. Knowing he would not play a character that was absolutely unsympathetic, Hagman immediately came in and won the role.      Met a young, unfamiliar actor Patrick Duffy in the movie, Hurricane (1974), before Hagman co-starred with him on Dallas (1978), opposite Hagman as his younger brother.      Was raised largely by his maternal grandmother while his mother became a famous stage actress.      Just before his death, his Dallas (1978) co-star, Linda Gray, played host to him at his 81st birthday luncheon at a restaurant in Dallas, Texas.      On I Dream of Jeannie (1965), he played an astronaut who was a member of the United States Air Force, in real-life, Hagman served in the United States Air Force.      Used to live in the same area as Michael Landon.      Acting mentor and friends of Patrick Duffy, Victoria Principal, Charlene Tilton and Sheree J. Wilson.      He played the same character (J.R. Ewing) on three different series: Dallas (1978), Knots Landing (1979) and Dallas (2012).      Was 1 month younger than his I Dream of Jeannie (1965) co-star Barbara Eden.      Was close friends with Hunter von Leer.      His character J.R. Ewing was so hated that Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauescu allowed \'\'Dallas\'\' to be one of the few series shown in his country and paid Hagman to show his image throughout the country as he saw his character as epitomizing the very worst of American capitalism and hoped it would turn people against the idea.      Was known to throw parties for the cast and crew at his home whenever tensions ran high on set.      Once stated that (before Dallas (1978)) young viewers often confused him with Dick York (or Dick Sargent) and DeForest Kelley.      When he wanted to audition for one of the male lead roles as J.R. Ewing in Dallas (1978), his character from I Dream of Jeannie (1965) nearly prevented him from accepting it, because he might\'ve been typecasted, but David Jacobs didn\'t mind him doing a soap opera.      His Dallas (1978) co-stars, Patrick Duffy and Sasha Mitchell co-starred on the popular 1990s sitcom, Step by Step (1991), also produced by Lorimar (now Warner Bros. Television).      Next to his Dallas (1978) co-star, Linda Gray, his favorite actress from that same serial was Deborah Rennard.      Carcinoma ran in his family.      On an episode of Dallas (1978), his character read the letter from his late TV father, in real-life, he lost his own father, years before the series started.      On Dallas (1978), his character drank heavily, in real-life, he also drank heavily, which led him to receiving a liver transplant in 1995, though it didn\'t damage the organ, when it weakened his immune system.      After Dallas (1978) and until Barbara Bel Geddes\'s death, he did not keep in touch with her.      Was a longtime friend of Richard Dawson. He used to play Frisbee at Hagman\'s house in Malibu, where he was living at the time.      Before his future Dallas (1978) co-star, Charlene Tilton, co-starred opposite Hagman in the series, as a little girl, she used to visit Hagman\'s dear friend, Richard Dawson off- the set of Hogan\'s Heroes (1965), where Dawson used to give her gum and candy, all the while, he took her around and watch him rehearse.      Maj Axelsson Hagman of Los Angeles, California, died May 31st, 2016. The loving wife of Actor Larry Hagman, she was known as an amazing hostess and mainstay of the family. Born in May, 1928 in Eskilstuna, Sweden, she was the eldest of four sisters. Her father, who had a car dealership in Sweden, told his daughter to ""reach for the stars in order to get to the treetops"" and Maj followed his advice moving to London and becoming an accomplished dress designer. In London she met the love of her life, a young serviceman named Larry Hagman, who had recently performed in the cast of the Broadway import musical ""South Pacific,"" with his mother, the acclaimed New York musical theater star Mary Martin. Mag moved to New York City as a military bride and supported her husband Larry by designing and sewing costumes for night club singers while Larry worked in the New York theater. When Larry landed a starring role in the early 1960s on Hollywood\'s ""I Dream of Jeannie,"" Mag turned her considerable talents to supporting Larry\'s ascending career while continuing to design clothes, build extraordinary homes and even custom-design Jacuzzis. Mag later shared in the joys and successes of Larry Hagman\'s success as ""JR Ewing"" on the popular hit television series ""Dallas"" that ran from the late 1970s through the 1980s. The couple supported philanthropic causes from the Dallas and Ojai Symphonies to organ donations and solar energy. The couple traveled the world together over five and a half decades of their marriage until Larry passed away in 2012. In the end, she surpassed the treetops and touched the stars. Maj and Larry are survived to their two children and five grandchildren.      His widow, Maj Axelsson was 3 yrs. his senior.      He was most widely known to be a social butterfly.      Her ex-Dallas (1978) co-star, Victoria Principal, used to live not too far from him. Before the series began, they were actually lifelong friends.      Along with Patrick Duffy, Charlene Tilton, Ted Shackelford and Joan Van Ark, he is one of only five actors to play the same character (J. R. Ewing) in all three series in the ""Dallas"" franchise: Dallas (1978), Knots Landing (1979) and Dallas (2012).Personal Quotes (30)      [Who said in February 2002, when appearing on the BBC\'s Shooting Stars]: I\'ve been on some loony shows in my time, but this one takes the cake.      I made money. Enough so I don\'t have to work again. But I\'d like to, I really would. But I\'d want to do something interesting like Santa Claus - or God.Barbara Eden is the most beautiful girl in the world.      I spent five years in England, I went over there with my mother in the show South Pacific and I just love it. I go back there three or four times a year. I joined the American airforce because the Korean war was going on at one time and I got my call up papers and I was supposed to report back to the United States and get my ass shot off in Korea which I didn\'t think was a smart idea and not only that I couldn\'t understand what the war was all about, I guess a lot of people could at that time but I still can\'t even more than I can the Vietnam war, so anyhow I enlisted in the American airforce and I was stationed in London for four years which was pretty good because I never gave up my civilian apartment in St Johns Wood. I got married, met a Swedish girl there, we\'ve been married 46 years now.      [on the infamous ""Who Shot J.R?"" episode]: ""Before that fateful shot rang out, I was merely bemused by the success of the character. Villainy could be fun, and that\'s how I played it. And if it worked. I mean I couldn\'t go down to the corner to pick up my copy of the Sunday New York Times without running into some nubile creature with ""J.R. for President"" emblazoned across her chest. Now a higher, shriller note had been added. People who once merely wanted J.R.\'s autograph demanded to know who shot him as if it were their birthright, and were angry and upset when I told them, truthfully, that I didn\'t know.      I was born with success. Lucky for me I am able to handle it. Also, I damn well deserve it!      People I meet really want me to be J.R., so it\'s hard to disappoint them.      [About co-star Linda Gray after her real-life divorce]: Maj and I kind of adopted her. She was here at the house nearly every day. We\'d call her first thing in the morning to make sure she was alright, we\'d make sure she had dinner every night.      [Referring to his choice of final resting place for his ashes] I want to be spread over a field and have marijuana and wheat planted and harvest it in a couple of years and then have a big marijuana cake, enough for 200 or 300 people. People eat a little of Larry.      I\'m stronger now than when I started this whole rigamarole. I know I have a nice 36-year-old liver in the body of a 66-year-old man and I feel wonderful.      [In 1998]: We recycle everything else - tires, glass, paper, you name it. Why not recycle our bodies?      [About his lifelong friendship with Carroll O\'Connor]: Carroll is really my mentor. He knows more [show business] than any other actor I know.      [In 1965]: I\'m the kind of guy who says I am $15 overdrawn at the bank when I have $700 in the account. That\'s how pessimistic I am. With that in mind, I want to say that I don\'t know how I Dream of Jeannie can fail.      The time is ripe for a bad guy, and I\'m it.      [In 1980]: I\'ve been married 26 years and it lasts because I take my wife with me, wherever I go.      They say it\'s no worse than standing in front of a TV set. That\'s what they said about asbestos and World War II radiation experiments.      [If he were to leave Dallas (1978), then Robert Culp would take over his role which would\'ve not upset Hagman]: I\'m almost 50. I simply would have gone on to something else. As you get older, you think of things you would like to do. As of now, I\'ve got my toy.      Naw, I asked Walter Cronkite to be vice president. Everybody loves Walter, a lot of people don\'t like Mr. Nixon and a lot of people don\'t like Don.      [Who said in 1983 upon meeting with Joan Collins for the first time]: She was the most beautiful women.      [In 1971]: I grew up in a family that had servants, including butlers - I\'ve been around servants all my life - and somehow we got the proper procedures straightened out without calling in an expert.      [on his role of I Dream of Jeannie (1965) that was finally cancelled]: But it spelled trouble. It was hard on me. It hit me like a bang.      [on his popularity while playing the fifty-something brother/villain J.R. Ewing on Dallas (1978)]: Everybody knows a J.R. They have a boss, an uncle, a daddy, a florist who is just like him. And not just in America either. J.R. is all over the world, set aside from others in that he has been trained to succeed at any cost.      [Upon his introduction to marijuana by Jack Nicholson, as a safer alternative to his heavy drinking]: I liked it because it was fun, it made me feel good, and I never had a hangover!      [When he landed the part on I Dream of Jeannie (1965)]: They did the first season in black and white to save $500 a show. I came out; I was out of work. I had done \'The Edge of Night\' in New York.      [Who said in 2011 about his stage 2 throat cancer diagnosis]: As J. R. I could get away with anything - bribery, blackmail and adultery. But I got caught by cancer. I do want everyone to know that it is a very common and treatable form of cancer. I will be receiving treatment while working on the new Dallas series. I could not think of a better place to be than working on a show I love, with people I love.      If you do your research on hot springs all over the world, they\'re usually places of peace. People, even in warring nations and so forth, they\'ll go and live in peace together around the hot springs, which were always considered medicinal. I firmly believe in water therapy.      [on his book]: I didn\'t put anything in that I thought I was going to hurt someone or compromise them in anyway, not that I had too many things in my life.      [In 1981]: A year later, when they say they didn\'t say what they said, I play back the tape.      [From playing the woman\'s master to playing a dastardly, charming villain]: I was in \'Jeannie\' for sometime and I made the transition to a bad guy from a rather bumbling idiot. And I hope that this will be a slightly different edge. At my age, I suppose it\'s about the last one I\'ll have an opportunity to do. So, I\'m going to have a lot of fun with this.      [In 1989]: By God, you\'re right, I had not thought of that.

People may hate this movie for the exact reason it was made: it blew
the facade off Hollywood, exposing it for the cutthroat atmosphere that
it is. Both Julie Andrews &amp; Blake Edwards had every reason to hate
Hollywood for what they did to them (chastising Blake for his
indulgence, boxing Julie into a corner with sticky-sweet roles), so
this wicked satire was their way of firing back &amp; people either got the
joke &amp; were offended or didn't get it &amp; just hated the movie for what
it was. No doubt the film industry had the former reaction, proved by
the little publicity the film received. Moviegoers probably thought
more the latter, causing it to flop at the box-office &amp; not exactly
giving Julie &amp; Blake the better opportunities they were looking for
(both have found it difficult to find films outside of the
stereotypical ones they made their name with). Some thought the famous
breast-baring shots of Julie were gratuitous &amp; shameful, yet they were
the point of the film: wanting to evolve in the name of art &amp; being
talked out of it in the name of commerce. A movie like S.O.B. might
actually play better today because such diatribes against the movie
industry by its employees can find an audience who are now much wiser
to the evil workings of the business (notice how THE PLAYER &amp; SUNSET
BOULEVARD are classics today, recognized as such by the industry they
set out to skewer).

How rare it is to see a terrific comedy meant for adults. ""S.O.B."" is
Blake
Edwards dark look at life in Hollywood. And believe me he pulls no
punches.
Everyone and everything is a target and he hits it almost every
time.<br><br>""S.O.B."" tells the story of a big director whose latest film is the
biggest
flop in movie history. Despondent he spends the first half of the film
trying to kill himself and the second half trying to save the film by
re-shooting it as an arty porno film complete with a nude scene by the
virginal female lead (played by the virginal Julie Andrews).<br><br>As I said no stone goes unturned. We get hints of drugs, death, murder,
suicide, sex, homosexuality (both men and women), transvestism, back
stabbing, grave robbing, and much more. But it is done in a tone that is
dark but extremely funny. Watching William Holden, Robert Preston, and
Robert Webber in their scenes in the third act is worth the time alone.
And,
yes, we do get to see Julie Andrews in a brief topless shot. It's nice if
you like her but nothing special.<br><br>The only complaint is that the film runs a bit too long. Edwards would
have
benefited the film with a trimming of about 15 minutes. But if you like
your
comedy dark, this is a must see.

This is a Hollywood movie about Hollywood that was ahead of its time twenty
years ago. For people who read their movie reviews from this site, it gives
a nice behind-the-scenes twist to what it takes to get what you want in the
motion picture business. There are many who felt it was too over-the-top
when first released, but as the years go by, it becomes more and more a
reflection of how real life is in the dream factory. Back in 1981, there was
much less interest among the non-glitterati for what happened to get films
made. With the advent of more and more movie magazines trying to dig up dirt
on the cogs that turn to keep Tinseltown running, a housewife in Oklahoma
can now know the grosses of the latest blockbuster and who stands to gain
from them. All this can be gleaned while waiting to check-out at the grocery
just by reading the headlines.<br><br>The studio owners and their investors are represented well in SOB. From the
lowliest security guard to the producers, actors, agents, directors,
writers, score composers, costumers and anyone else who is looking to
improve their status in the movie biz. Everyone here has an angle, just
trying to get through the film they are currently working on, making deals,
selling out and generally living day to day and jumping from bedroom to
bedroom in an attempt to hold on to what they think is happiness and
success. The empty shell of reality is a theme we see throughout this Blake
Edwards masterpiece.<br><br>The running story behind the main plot concerns an actor, past his
marketable prime, who collapses while jogging on a Malibu beach. The
callousness of the residents of this community is played for laughs but it
is tinged with a knowing wink that this is what becomes of those former
stars who have nothing more to give their public. A forgotten actor lay dead
in the sand for days while hundreds of people walk by, enjoying the sun,
oblivious to this shell of an old man who was once a well-known talent, but
is now no longer one of the beautiful people. Yet on this very beach in a
later scene, Felix Farmer, the director who is the center of the story tries
to kill himself and ends up driving his Cadillac into the Pacific Ocean.
Because of the grand spectacle of this possible death, the masses come to
the rescue and save him. A quiet humble passing is contrasted with rousing
flamboyant suicide attempt and who gets noticed?<br><br>The whole movie concerns a very serious frame of reference but the
characters surrounding the situation are not playing it straight; they are
silly and exasperated. This same plot could have easily been a humorless
drama with almost an identical script. A movie costing $30 million, already
a pittance by today's standards, flops at the box office and the major
players try to turn it to their advantage as best they can. Everyone
involved has an axe to grind and the motion picture in question almost
becomes a character itself. It prompts greed, jealousy, lust, back-stabbing
and even death. It is an evil thing which can engulf those who possess it,
as it keeps getting bigger, more expensive and further out of
control.<br><br>There are some really nasty people here and they do terrible things without
conscience. Some do them to make money and fame; others do them for art's
sake. But I can't think of a single character who is completely upstanding
and righteous, despite their redeemable qualities. The ones we think are
heroic and good are just less terrible in comparison with the others. Really
thinking about what is being said in this story can make your skin crawl. If
it wasn't played for humor the result may have been too horrifying to
create, let alone watch.<br><br>I don't want to give the impression that I disliked this film. It is right
on target. But I have seen it many times and with each viewing, another
layer of its veneer slips off and I see the meaning behind the actions and
words as presented. If you're really into the goings-on in today's
Hollywood, take a look at its past in S.O.B. and maybe you'll think a little
bit about what's happening on those sound stages and in those executive
meetings behind closed doors. Today, it could have only gotten exponentially
worse.

""S.O.B."", which is Blake Edwards' masterpiece, is a masterful and wicked
satire of Hollywood. This is Edwards' revenge for Hollywood's shallow
treatment of him during his 1968-1975 ""down"" period in which he made a
series of quite good flops which died at the boxoffice.<br><br>In fact, Edwards uses one of those flops, 1970's ""Darling Lili"", which I
gave three stars, as the backstory of ""S.O.B."" Let me describe to you what
happened with that film, as to give you the flavor of what this film is
about:
In 1968-1970, Blake Edwards made Darling Lili, his first film with his wife
Julie Andrews. It cost over 40 million dollars and took 3 at the box
office.
It was also savagely panned by the critics. Anyway,an undeterred Edwards
withdrew the film, edited it down from 145 mins to 113 mins, took out the
comic relief and rereleased it;here it did well enough to break
even.(Today,
the 113 minute cut is the one most often shown on TV)Critics liked the new
version.<br><br>In ""S.O.B."", Edwards takes everything one step further to create a savagely
hilarious comedy. Everything works here. Everything. The opening credits
sequence, in which he see the ""Darling Lili"" surrogate
Night Wind play out (it's supposed to be BAD, so relax), to the great
slapstick sequences (Mulligan's suicide attempts are particularly
funny)
to the ontarget performances which include Andrews, cast against type as a
rich bitch actress, William Holden as the director, Richard Mulligan as the
Blake Edwards surrogate and especially the great Robert Preston as the
local
Dr. Feelgood (called Finegarten in this; preston should have received a
nomination for his good work)There are also many other Edwards veterans in
the cast such as Robert Webber, Craig Stevens and Stuart Margolin, just to
name a few.<br><br>Seeing this film once is just not enough. It demands multiple viewings
because each time you find something new to enjoy and laugh at. Most of
all,
it makes you think about what occurred. And in the age of asinine so called
comedies such as ""Tomcats"", ""Joe Dirt"" and ""Deuce Bigelow"", finding a rare
and distinctive comedy like ""S.O.B"" is a real treasure.
It's a real shame that Edwards has retired from theatrical films, just
think
of what he could say today. Fortunately, ""S.O.B."" has remained fresh and
original.

Next to Victor/Victoria, S.O.B. is probably my favorite Blake Edwards film.
I'm not a great fan of his movies, but when his films are funny, they're
usually hilarious.  This movie has its fair share of laugh out loud moments
that more than make up for some of the slow and less-well-scripted parts. It
features a number of wonderful, if sometimes over-the-top, performances by
many well-known performers. Most of the scenery chewing is very well in tune
with the theme of this Hollywood harpooning. Given the ever-increasingly
cynical nature of movie producing, some of S.O.B.'s elements even seem
quaint.<br><br>The Viking send-off is one of my all-time most memorable movie scenes, and
the fact that this is also William Holden's last role gives this section an
added air of sadness.

I discovered this film on Cable-TV on a wonderfully programmed channel
called ""Z"" in Los Angeles in the late 80's when they had a week long Blake
Edwards Director's focus. Until that time, the only thing I thought Blake
Edwards did was ""The Pink Panther"" which was not my kind of film(s) but was
okay.<br><br>S.O.B. is a funny yet sobering look at Hollywood. This is a film from a
director that literally bites the hand that fed him. And as PC as we are
today, a film such as this one could never be made on this scale. Many of
the characters portrayed reminded you of folks who were more prominent in
the 50's, 60's and 70's although it also reminded me of several people in
the 80's, 90's and 2000's as well. But Edwards hits hard at it all,
including the career his own wife, Julie Andrews. (And yes she does have
great ta-tas under that Peter Pan suit!)<br><br>This film will be a bit uneven for those who aren't very familiar with the
above the line and below the line workings of Hollywood. Edwards leaves no
stone unturned from the lowley Assistants to the snazzy Producers and
studios, from being on top and living high in Hollywood to what happens when
you die, even your damn funeral is an Academy Award event!!!<br><br>This is about everyone that makes Hollywood tick and everyone who thinks
because they work in the system -- is the system. It's over 20 years later
and I think this will be one of those films that will grow better with
age...and knowledge. I recommend this film as a top film to see for anyone
wanting ""in"" in Hollywood, and for those who want to be on the outside
looking in. A really talented, daring film.

I ""discovered"" this movie on cable in the mid-late 80's and immediately
fell in love with it. It's witty, scathingly funny and some of it is so
rapid-fire that it requires viewing multiple times to catch all that is
being said. I heard some Hollywood type espousing once that
""stereotypes are only stereotypes because they're true."" We've all seen
the stereotypical, ego-centric Hollywood agents and other sycophants
portrayed in various movies/shows/etc. but rarely have they all been
assembled in one hysterical place and portrayed by such a star-studded
rogues gallery! Robert Preston is my favorite as the perpetually
drunk/stoned quack doctor, and William Holden's last performance as the
aged, burned-out director is particularly poignant when he gives a
brief speech of ""encouragement"" to Felix (Richard Mulligan) about
consciously trying to kill himself with drugs, booze and sexual
excesses for the past 40 years. So some of the ""moments of truth"" are
not just realizations about the business itself, but about the actors
playing the roles. An all-around great movie.

Blake Edwards, ""S.O.B.,"" is one of the funniest satires of the vicious
machine known as Hollywood ever made. Felix Farmer (Richard Mulligan)is
one of Hollywood's most popular directors. All his films were
box-office hits and everyone loved him...until his latest family
oriented film is a HUGE flop. Farmer's life then goes down the toilet.
His wife Sally Miles, America's Sweetheart(Julie Andrews),leaves him.
Felix has a nervous breakdown, which gives in to suicidal tendencies.
His 3 friends (William Holden, Robert Preston, and Robert Webber)try to
keep his body and soul together. It's during a party at Felix's house
(That turns into a orgy)that Felix comes up with an idea to save his
flop: buy back his film and turn it into a sexcapade, which includes a
nude scene with his estranged wife.<br><br>Throughout the film, you see the backstabbing that goes on when Felix
is re-working his film: studio heads that try to steal his film when it
looks like it will be a sure-fire hit, assistants that try to get their
foot in the door, youth pushing out the old, and sensationalism is the
norm. It's also incredibly sad because it also shows that the Hollywood
machine has no mercy: stars and directors are put onto pedestals, only
for those pedestals to be cruelly yanked from underneath them (The
once-famous star that drops dead on a beach, and remains on the beach
for a few days, unknown and unloved). Felix soon becomes a victim of
the Hollywood machine when they underhandedly steal his film, and goes
through desperate measures to get it back. The result turns into one of
the most poignant endings I have ever seen.<br><br>The lines in the film are sharp enough to draw blood. Robert Preston
practically steals the film away from the fact that you see Julie
Andrews pretty much kill her ""Mary Poppins"" image by showing her boobs,
swearing and being a total witch! This would make a great double
feature with ""The Player."" Check it out!

S.O.B. was director Blake Edwards' own ""All that Jazz"", a
self-indulgent, slightly over-the-top, slightly disguised look at a
particularly period in his Hollywood career where he and wife Julie
Andrews were treated pretty despicably by the Hollywood big shots who
can make or break people in Hollywood with one telephone call. This
film is loosely based on the time after Edwards had completed his
wife's film STAR! and the studio hated it, wrested control of the film
from Edwards, cut like an hour of footage from the film, retitled it
""These Were the Happy Times"" and then tried to shelve it. After all of
this Edwards couldn't get arrested in Hollywood until he hit a bullseye
with the 1979 comedy ""10."" But this 1981 comedy was a reminder to
Hollywood bigwigs that Edwards had not forgotten their treatment of
him. In S.O.B.(which, BTW, stands for Standard Operational Bull***t),
Richard Mulligan plays the manic Hollywood director, Felix Farmer, who
is suicidal after his film ""Night Wind"", starring his wife, Sally Miles
(Julie Andrews) bombs miserably. Farmer is practically written off in
Hollywood until he gets the inspiration to re-shoot the film as a near
pornographic extravaganza and have his wife bare her breasts for the
first time on screen. This uncompromising look at the inner workings of
Hollywood may seem a little off the wall. These are not pleasant people
for the most part and every character in the film, even Andrews, has
their own agenda. The merciless screenplay is well executed by a
glorious all-star cast backing up Mulligan and Andrews, including
William Holden, Robert Vaughn, Robert Preston (hysterical as a doctor
who gives out pills like candy), Robert Webber, Loretta Swit, Craig
Stevens, Stuart Margolin, Shelley Winters, Marisa Berensen, Rosanna
Arquette, Robert Loggia, and Larry Hagman. There are several funny
scenes in this film and a lot of interesting things happen that by the
time Andrews does bare her breasts, it is somewhat anti-climactic, but
there is much to enjoy here for those willing to pay the attention that
is required as the story is painted on a broad canvas with a lot of
characters, but it is worth the trip and, after I saw it the first
time, I wanted to see it again and again and think it is one of the
great sleepers of 1980's.

People may hate this movie for the exact reason it was made: it blew
the facade off Hollywood, exposing it for the cutthroat atmosphere that
it is. Both Julie Andrews &amp; Blake Edwards had every reason to hate
Hollywood for what they did to them (chastising Blake for his
indulgence, boxing Julie into a corner with sticky-sweet roles), so
this wicked satire was their way of firing back &amp; people either got the
joke &amp; were offended or didn't get it &amp; just hated the movie for what
it was. No doubt the film industry had the former reaction, proved by
the little publicity the film received. Moviegoers probably thought
more the latter, causing it to flop at the box-office &amp; not exactly
giving Julie &amp; Blake the better opportunities they were looking for
(both have found it difficult to find films outside of the
stereotypical ones they made their name with). Some thought the famous
breast-baring shots of Julie were gratuitous &amp; shameful, yet they were
the point of the film: wanting to evolve in the name of art &amp; being
talked out of it in the name of commerce. A movie like S.O.B. might
actually play better today because such diatribes against the movie
industry by its employees can find an audience who are now much wiser
to the evil workings of the business (notice how THE PLAYER &amp; SUNSET
BOULEVARD are classics today, recognized as such by the industry they
set out to skewer).

How rare it is to see a terrific comedy meant for adults. ""S.O.B."" is
Blake
Edwards dark look at life in Hollywood. And believe me he pulls no
punches.
Everyone and everything is a target and he hits it almost every
time.<br><br>""S.O.B."" tells the story of a big director whose latest film is the
biggest
flop in movie history. Despondent he spends the first half of the film
trying to kill himself and the second half trying to save the film by
re-shooting it as an arty porno film complete with a nude scene by the
virginal female lead (played by the virginal Julie Andrews).<br><br>As I said no stone goes unturned. We get hints of drugs, death, murder,
suicide, sex, homosexuality (both men and women), transvestism, back
stabbing, grave robbing, and much more. But it is done in a tone that is
dark but extremely funny. Watching William Holden, Robert Preston, and
Robert Webber in their scenes in the third act is worth the time alone.
And,
yes, we do get to see Julie Andrews in a brief topless shot. It's nice if
you like her but nothing special.<br><br>The only complaint is that the film runs a bit too long. Edwards would
have
benefited the film with a trimming of about 15 minutes. But if you like
your
comedy dark, this is a must see.

This is a Hollywood movie about Hollywood that was ahead of its time twenty
years ago. For people who read their movie reviews from this site, it gives
a nice behind-the-scenes twist to what it takes to get what you want in the
motion picture business. There are many who felt it was too over-the-top
when first released, but as the years go by, it becomes more and more a
reflection of how real life is in the dream factory. Back in 1981, there was
much less interest among the non-glitterati for what happened to get films
made. With the advent of more and more movie magazines trying to dig up dirt
on the cogs that turn to keep Tinseltown running, a housewife in Oklahoma
can now know the grosses of the latest blockbuster and who stands to gain
from them. All this can be gleaned while waiting to check-out at the grocery
just by reading the headlines.<br><br>The studio owners and their investors are represented well in SOB. From the
lowliest security guard to the producers, actors, agents, directors,
writers, score composers, costumers and anyone else who is looking to
improve their status in the movie biz. Everyone here has an angle, just
trying to get through the film they are currently working on, making deals,
selling out and generally living day to day and jumping from bedroom to
bedroom in an attempt to hold on to what they think is happiness and
success. The empty shell of reality is a theme we see throughout this Blake
Edwards masterpiece.<br><br>The running story behind the main plot concerns an actor, past his
marketable prime, who collapses while jogging on a Malibu beach. The
callousness of the residents of this community is played for laughs but it
is tinged with a knowing wink that this is what becomes of those former
stars who have nothing more to give their public. A forgotten actor lay dead
in the sand for days while hundreds of people walk by, enjoying the sun,
oblivious to this shell of an old man who was once a well-known talent, but
is now no longer one of the beautiful people. Yet on this very beach in a
later scene, Felix Farmer, the director who is the center of the story tries
to kill himself and ends up driving his Cadillac into the Pacific Ocean.
Because of the grand spectacle of this possible death, the masses come to
the rescue and save him. A quiet humble passing is contrasted with rousing
flamboyant suicide attempt and who gets noticed?<br><br>The whole movie concerns a very serious frame of reference but the
characters surrounding the situation are not playing it straight; they are
silly and exasperated. This same plot could have easily been a humorless
drama with almost an identical script. A movie costing $30 million, already
a pittance by today's standards, flops at the box office and the major
players try to turn it to their advantage as best they can. Everyone
involved has an axe to grind and the motion picture in question almost
becomes a character itself. It prompts greed, jealousy, lust, back-stabbing
and even death. It is an evil thing which can engulf those who possess it,
as it keeps getting bigger, more expensive and further out of
control.<br><br>There are some really nasty people here and they do terrible things without
conscience. Some do them to make money and fame; others do them for art's
sake. But I can't think of a single character who is completely upstanding
and righteous, despite their redeemable qualities. The ones we think are
heroic and good are just less terrible in comparison with the others. Really
thinking about what is being said in this story can make your skin crawl. If
it wasn't played for humor the result may have been too horrifying to
create, let alone watch.<br><br>I don't want to give the impression that I disliked this film. It is right
on target. But I have seen it many times and with each viewing, another
layer of its veneer slips off and I see the meaning behind the actions and
words as presented. If you're really into the goings-on in today's
Hollywood, take a look at its past in S.O.B. and maybe you'll think a little
bit about what's happening on those sound stages and in those executive
meetings behind closed doors. Today, it could have only gotten exponentially
worse.

""S.O.B."", which is Blake Edwards' masterpiece, is a masterful and wicked
satire of Hollywood. This is Edwards' revenge for Hollywood's shallow
treatment of him during his 1968-1975 ""down"" period in which he made a
series of quite good flops which died at the boxoffice.<br><br>In fact, Edwards uses one of those flops, 1970's ""Darling Lili"", which I
gave three stars, as the backstory of ""S.O.B."" Let me describe to you what
happened with that film, as to give you the flavor of what this film is
about:
In 1968-1970, Blake Edwards made Darling Lili, his first film with his wife
Julie Andrews. It cost over 40 million dollars and took 3 at the box
office.
It was also savagely panned by the critics. Anyway,an undeterred Edwards
withdrew the film, edited it down from 145 mins to 113 mins, took out the
comic relief and rereleased it;here it did well enough to break
even.(Today,
the 113 minute cut is the one most often shown on TV)Critics liked the new
version.<br><br>In ""S.O.B."", Edwards takes everything one step further to create a savagely
hilarious comedy. Everything works here. Everything. The opening credits
sequence, in which he see the ""Darling Lili"" surrogate
Night Wind play out (it's supposed to be BAD, so relax), to the great
slapstick sequences (Mulligan's suicide attempts are particularly
funny)
to the ontarget performances which include Andrews, cast against type as a
rich bitch actress, William Holden as the director, Richard Mulligan as the
Blake Edwards surrogate and especially the great Robert Preston as the
local
Dr. Feelgood (called Finegarten in this; preston should have received a
nomination for his good work)There are also many other Edwards veterans in
the cast such as Robert Webber, Craig Stevens and Stuart Margolin, just to
name a few.<br><br>Seeing this film once is just not enough. It demands multiple viewings
because each time you find something new to enjoy and laugh at. Most of
all,
it makes you think about what occurred. And in the age of asinine so called
comedies such as ""Tomcats"", ""Joe Dirt"" and ""Deuce Bigelow"", finding a rare
and distinctive comedy like ""S.O.B"" is a real treasure.
It's a real shame that Edwards has retired from theatrical films, just
think
of what he could say today. Fortunately, ""S.O.B."" has remained fresh and
original.

Next to Victor/Victoria, S.O.B. is probably my favorite Blake Edwards film.
I'm not a great fan of his movies, but when his films are funny, they're
usually hilarious.  This movie has its fair share of laugh out loud moments
that more than make up for some of the slow and less-well-scripted parts. It
features a number of wonderful, if sometimes over-the-top, performances by
many well-known performers. Most of the scenery chewing is very well in tune
with the theme of this Hollywood harpooning. Given the ever-increasingly
cynical nature of movie producing, some of S.O.B.'s elements even seem
quaint.<br><br>The Viking send-off is one of my all-time most memorable movie scenes, and
the fact that this is also William Holden's last role gives this section an
added air of sadness.

I discovered this film on Cable-TV on a wonderfully programmed channel
called ""Z"" in Los Angeles in the late 80's when they had a week long Blake
Edwards Director's focus. Until that time, the only thing I thought Blake
Edwards did was ""The Pink Panther"" which was not my kind of film(s) but was
okay.<br><br>S.O.B. is a funny yet sobering look at Hollywood. This is a film from a
director that literally bites the hand that fed him. And as PC as we are
today, a film such as this one could never be made on this scale. Many of
the characters portrayed reminded you of folks who were more prominent in
the 50's, 60's and 70's although it also reminded me of several people in
the 80's, 90's and 2000's as well. But Edwards hits hard at it all,
including the career his own wife, Julie Andrews. (And yes she does have
great ta-tas under that Peter Pan suit!)<br><br>This film will be a bit uneven for those who aren't very familiar with the
above the line and below the line workings of Hollywood. Edwards leaves no
stone unturned from the lowley Assistants to the snazzy Producers and
studios, from being on top and living high in Hollywood to what happens when
you die, even your damn funeral is an Academy Award event!!!<br><br>This is about everyone that makes Hollywood tick and everyone who thinks
because they work in the system -- is the system. It's over 20 years later
and I think this will be one of those films that will grow better with
age...and knowledge. I recommend this film as a top film to see for anyone
wanting ""in"" in Hollywood, and for those who want to be on the outside
looking in. A really talented, daring film.

I ""discovered"" this movie on cable in the mid-late 80's and immediately
fell in love with it. It's witty, scathingly funny and some of it is so
rapid-fire that it requires viewing multiple times to catch all that is
being said. I heard some Hollywood type espousing once that
""stereotypes are only stereotypes because they're true."" We've all seen
the stereotypical, ego-centric Hollywood agents and other sycophants
portrayed in various movies/shows/etc. but rarely have they all been
assembled in one hysterical place and portrayed by such a star-studded
rogues gallery! Robert Preston is my favorite as the perpetually
drunk/stoned quack doctor, and William Holden's last performance as the
aged, burned-out director is particularly poignant when he gives a
brief speech of ""encouragement"" to Felix (Richard Mulligan) about
consciously trying to kill himself with drugs, booze and sexual
excesses for the past 40 years. So some of the ""moments of truth"" are
not just realizations about the business itself, but about the actors
playing the roles. An all-around great movie.

He was of English, Ulster-Scots, and Irish ancestry.Clyde developed a lung condition that required him to move his family from Iowa to the warmer climate of southern California, where they tried ranching in the Mojave Desert. Until the ranch failed, Marion and his younger brother Robert E. Morrison swam in an irrigation ditch and rode a horse to school. When the ranch failed, the family moved to Glendale, California, where Marion delivered medicines for his father, sold newspapers and had an Airedale dog named ""Duke"" (the source of his own nickname). He did well at school both academically and in football. When he narrowly failed admission to Annapolis he went to USC on a football scholarship 1925-7. Tom Mix got him a summer job as a prop man in exchange for football tickets. On the set he became close friends with director John Ford for whom, among others, he began doing bit parts, some billed as John Wayne. His first featured film was Men Without Women (1930). After more than 70 low-budget westerns and adventures, mostly routine, Wayne\'s career was stuck in a rut until Ford cast him in Stagecoach (1939), the movie that made him a star. He appeared in nearly 250 movies, many of epic proportions. From 1942-43 he was in a radio series, ""The Three Sheets to the Wind"", and in 1944 he helped found the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a Conservative political organization, later becoming its President. His conservative political stance was also reflected in The Alamo (1960), which he produced, directed and starred in. His patriotic stand was enshrined in The Green Berets (1968) which he co-directed and starred in. Over the years Wayne was beset with health problems. In September 1964 he had a cancerous left lung removed; in March 1978 there was heart valve replacement surgery; and in January 1979 his stomach was removed. He received the Best Actor nomination for Sands of Iwo Jima (1949) and finally got the Oscar for his role as one-eyed Rooster Cogburn in True Grit (1969). A Congressional Gold Medal was struck in his honor in 1979. He is perhaps best remembered for his parts in Ford\'s cavalry trilogy - Fort Apache (1948), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and Rio Grande (1950).- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Ed Stephan          Spouse (3) Pilar Wayne (1 November\xa01954            - 11 June\xa01979)\xa0(his death)\xa0(3 children)           Esperanza Baur (17 January\xa01946            - 1 November\xa01954)\xa0(divorced)                         Josephine Alicia Saenz          (24 June\xa01933            - 25 December\xa01945)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(4 children)          Trade Mark (5)        Slow talk and distinctive gravelly voice        Distinctive cat-like walk        His movies frequently reflected his conservative values        Often starred with Maureen O\'Hara        Westerns and war moviesTrivia (240)      Holds the record for the actor with the most leading parts - 142.

Sons with Josephine: Michael Wayne (producer) (died 2003, age 68) and Patrick Wayne (actor); daughters Toni Wayne (died 2000, age 64) and Melinda Wayne.      Most published sources refer to Wayne\'s birth name as Marion Michael Morrison. His birth certificate, however, gives his original name as Marion Robert Morrison. According to Wayne\'s own statements, after the birth of his younger brother in 1911, his parents named the newborn Robert Emmett and changed Wayne\'s name from Marion Robert to Marion Michael. It has also been suggested by several of his biographers that Wayne\'s parents actually changed his birth name from Marion Robert to Marion Mitchell. In ""Duke: The Life and Times of John Wayne"" (1985), Donald Shepherd and Robert F. Slatzer state that when Wayne\'s younger brother was born, ""the Duke\'s middle name was changed from Robert to Mitchell. . . . After he gained celebrity, Duke deliberately confused biographers and others by claiming Michael as his middle name, a claim that had no basis in fact.""      His production company, Batjac, was originally to be called Batjak, after the shipping company owned by Luther Adler\'s character in the film Wake of the Red Witch (1948). A secretary\'s typo while she was drawing up the papers resulted in it being called Batjac, and Wayne, not wanting to hurt her feelings, kept her spelling of it.

Great-uncle of boxer/actor Tommy Morrison, aka ""The Duke"".      An entry in the logbook of director John Ford\'s yacht ""Araner"", during a voyage along the Baja peninsula, made a reference to one of Wayne\'s pranks on Ward Bond: ""Caught the first mate [Wayne] pissing in [Ward] Bond\'s flask this morning - must remember to give him a raise.""      He and his drinking buddy, actor Ward Bond, frequently played practical jokes on each other. In one incident, Bond bet Wayne that they could stand on opposite sides of a newspaper and Wayne wouldn\'t be able to hit him. Bond set a sheet of newspaper down in a doorway, Wayne stood on one end, and Bond slammed the door in his face, shouting ""Try and hit me now!"" Wayne responded by sending his fist through the door, flooring Bond (and winning the bet).      His favorite drink was Sauza Commemorativo Tequila, and he often served it with ice that he had chipped from an iceberg during one of his voyages on his yacht, ""The Wild Goose"".      He was offered the lead in The Dirty Dozen (1967), but went to star in and direct The Green Berets (1968) instead. The part was eventually given to Lee Marvin. He also felt that the film portrayed the military in a bad light.      The evening before a shoot he was trying to get some sleep in a Las Vegas hotel. The suite directly below his was that of Frank Sinatra (never a good friend of Wayne), who was having a party. The noise kept Wayne awake, and each time he made a complaining phone call it quieted temporarily but each time eventually grew louder. Wayne at last appeared at Sinatra\'s door and told Frank to stop the noise. A Sinatra bodyguard of Wayne\'s size approached saying, ""Nobody talks to Mr. Sinatra that way."" Wayne looked at the man, turned as though to leave, then backhanded the bodyguard, who fell to the floor, where Wayne knocked him out by crashing a chair on top of him. The party noise stopped.      He was a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity.      His spoken album ""America: Why I Love Her"" became a surprise best-seller and Grammy nominee when it was released in 1973. Reissued on CD in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, it became a best-seller all over again.      Pictured on one of four 25¢ US commemorative postage stamps issued on Friday, March 23rd, 1990 honoring classic films released in 1939. The stamp featured Wayne as The Ringo Kid in Stagecoach (1939). The other films honored were Beau Geste (1939), The Wizard of Oz (1939), and Gone with the Wind (1939).      Upon being cast by Raoul Walsh in Fox\'s The Big Trail (1930) the studio decided his name had to be changed. Walsh said he was reading a biography on General ""Mad"" Anthony Wayne and suggested that name. The studio liked the last name but not the first and decided on ""John Wayne"" as the final rendition.      He once made a cameo appearance on The Beverly Hillbillies (1962). In episode, The Beverly Hillbillies: The Indians Are Coming (1967). And when asked how he wanted to be paid, his answer, in return, was ""Give me a fifth of bourbon - that\'ll square it."".      In 1973 he was awarded the Gold Medal from the National Football Foundation for his days playing football for Glendale High School and USC.      Arguably Wayne\'s worst film, The Conqueror (1956), in which he played Genghis Kahn, was based on a script that director Dick Powell had every intention of throwing into the wastebasket. According to Powell, when he had to leave his office at RKO for a few minutes during a story conference, he returned to find a very enthused Wayne reading the script, which had been in a pile of possible scripts on Powell\'s desk, and insisting that this was the movie he wanted to make. As Powell himself summed it up, ""Who am I to turn down John Wayne?"".      Among his favorite leisure activities were playing bridge, poker, and chess.      He was buried at Pacific View Cemetery in Corona del Mar, California, (a community within his hometown of Newport Beach). His grave finally received a plaque in 1999.      Inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 1974.      Grandfather of actor Brendan Wayne.      Because his on-screen adventures involved the slaying of a slew of Mexicans, Native Americans and Japanese, he has been called a racist by his critics. They believe this was strengthened by a Playboy Magazine interview in which he suggested that blacks were not yet qualified to hold high public office because ""discrimination prevented them from receiving the kind of education a political career requires"". Yet all of his three wives were of Latin descent.      He was voted the 5th Greatest Movie Star of all time by Entertainment Weekly.      Just on his sheer popularity and his prominent political activism, the Republican party in 1968 supposedly asked him to run for President of the USA, even though he had no previous political experience. He turned them down because he did not believe America would take a movie star running for the President seriously. He did however support Ronald Reagan\'s campaigns for governor of California in 1966 and 1970, as well as his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976.      Wayne was initiated into DeMolay in 1924 at the Glendale Chapter in Glendale California.      Received the DeMolay Legion of Honor in 1970.      He was a Master Mason.      Pictured on a 37¢ USA commemorative stamp in the Legends of Hollywood series, issued on Thursday, September 9th, 2004. The first-day ceremonies were held at Grauman\'s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.      Was a member of the first class to be inducted into the DeMolay Hall of Fame on Monday, November 13th, 1986.      Although he complained that High Noon (1952) was ""un-American"", he was gracious enough to collect Gary Cooper\'s Oscar on his behalf. He was mainly afraid the movie would hurt \'Coop\'s career. He later teamed up with director Howard Hawks to tell the story his way in Rio Bravo (1959).      He had English, Scots-Irish (Northern Irish), and Irish ancestry.      He was voted the 4th Greatest Movie Star of all time by Premiere Magazine.      Was named the #13 greatest actor on The 50 Greatest Screen Legends list by the American Film Institute      He turned down Gregory Peck\'s role in Twelve O\'Clock High (1949).      Posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\'s highest civilian award, by President Jimmy Carter in 1980.      Brother of Robert E. Morrison.      Addressed the Republican National Convention on its opening day in 1968.      On Monday, June 11th, 1979, the flame of the Olympic Torch at the Coliseum in Los Angeles, was lit for honoring him, in memory. It remained lit until the funeral four days later, Friday, June 15th, 1979.Maureen O\'Hara presented him with the People\'s Choice Award for most popular motion picture actor in 1976.      During the filming of The Undefeated (1969), he fell from his horse and fractured three ribs. He couldn\'t work for almost two weeks. Then he tore a ligament in his shoulder and couldn\'t use one arm at all. The director, Andrew V. McLaglen, could only film him from an angle for the rest of the picture. His only concern throughout was not to disappoint his fans, despite being in terrible pain.      According to movie industry columnist James Bacon, Wayne\'s producers issued phony press releases when he was hospitalized for cancer surgery in September 1964, claiming the star was being treated for lung congestion. ""Those bastards who make pictures only think of the box office,"" he told Bacon, as recounted in 1979 by the columnist. ""They figure Duke Wayne with cancer isn\'t a good image. I was too doped up at the time to argue with them, but I\'m telling you the truth now. You know I never lie."" After Bacon broke the story of the Duke\'s cancer, thousands of cancer victims and their relatives wrote to Wayne saying that his battle against the disease had given them hope.      He underwent surgery to have a cancerous left lung removed on Thursday, September 17th, 1964, in a six-hour operation. Press releases at the time reported that Wayne was in Los Angeles\' Good Samaritan Hospital to be treated for lung congestion. When Hollywood columnist James Bacon went to the hospital to see Wayne, he was told by a nurse that Wayne wasn\'t having visitors. According to a Monday, June 27th, 1978, ""Us"" magazine article, Wayne said to his nurse from his room, ""Let that son of a bitch come in."" When Bacon sat down in his room, Wayne told him, ""Well, I licked the Big C."" Wayne confessed that his five-packs-a-day cigarette habit had caused a lung tumor the size of a golf ball, necessitating the removal of the entire lung. One day following surgery, Wayne began coughing so violently he ruptured his stitches and damaged delicate tissue. His face and hands began to swell up from a mixture of fluid and air, but the doctors didn\'t dare operate again so soon. Five days later they drained the fluid and repaired the stitches. On Tuesday, December 29th, 1964, Wayne held a press conference at his Encino ranch, against the advice of his agent and advisers, where he announced, ""I licked the Big C. I know the man upstairs will pull the plug when he wants to, but I don\'t want to end my life being sick. I want to go out on two feet, in action."" Before he had left the hospital on October 19th, Wayne received the news that his 52-year-old brother Robert E. Morrison had lung cancer.      Regretted playing Temujin in The Conqueror (1956) so much that he visibly shuddered whenever anyone mentioned the film\'s name. He once remarked that the moral of the film was ""not to make an ass of yourself trying to play parts you\'re not suited for.""      In 1978, after recovering from open heart surgery, he had a script commissioned for a film called ""Beau John"" in which he would star with Ron Howard, but due to his declining health it never happened. According to Howard, they saw each other at a function, and Wayne said to him that he had the script and said ""It\'s me and you kid, or it\'s NOBODY!"".      In November 2003 he once again commanded a top-ten spot in the annual Harris Poll asking Americans to name their favorite movie star. No other deceased star has achieved such ranking since Harris began asking the question in 1993. In a 2001 Gallup Poll, Americans selected Wayne as their favorite movie star of all time. He has been in the top-ten of the Harris poll each and every year it has come out, and usually in the top three. He is the only deceased actor to ever appear in this poll.      He made several films early in his career as a ""singing"" cowboy. His singing voice was supplied by a singer hidden off camera.      In 1971 he displayed a sense of humor when he appeared on The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour (1969) in his usual western screen costume, flashing the peace sign to the show\'s other guests that week, the then-hot rock band Three Dog Night.      Of his many film roles, his personal favorite was that of Ethan Edwards from The Searchers (1956). Wayne even went so far as to name his son Ethan after that character.      In 1979, as it became known that Wayne was dying of cancer, Barry Goldwater introduced legislation to award him the Congressional Gold Medal. Maureen O\'Hara and Elizabeth Taylor flew to Washington to give testimony, and signed statements in support of the motion from Frank Sinatra, Gregory Peck, Jack Lemmon, Kirk Douglas, James Stewart and Katharine Hepburn were read out. The bill was passed unanimously, and the medal was presented to the Wayne family in the following year.      In 1974, with the Vietnam war still continuing, The Harvard Lampoon invited Wayne to The Harvard Square Theater to award him the ""Brass Balls Award"" for his ""Outstanding machismo and a penchant for punching people"". Wayne accepted and arrived riding atop an armored personnel carrier manned by the ""Black Knights"" of Troop D, Fifth Regiment. Wayne took the stage and ad-libbed his way through a series of derogatory questions with adroitness, displaying an agile wit that completely won over the audience of students.      Although on May 14, 1979, John Wayne\'s son Michael did arrange a visit to his father by Archbishop Marcos McGrath of Panama, it was not until June 11, 1979, two days before he died, that John Wayne would be baptized (likely conditionally) by Fr. Robert Curtis, UCLA Medical Center chaplain.      Mentioned in many songs, including Jimmy Buffett\'s ""Incommunicado"", Tom Lehrer\'s ""Send The Marines"", Ray Stevens\' ""Beside Myself"", Paula Cole\'s ""Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?"", Queen\'s ""Bicycle Race"" and Bruce Dickinson\'s (of Iron Maiden fame) ""Sacred Cowboys"".      Along with Charlton Heston, Wayne was offered and turned down the role of Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell in Steven Spielberg\'s 1941 (1979), because he felt the film was an insult to World War II veterans, and also due to his own declining health.      Underwent surgery for an enlarged prostate in December 1976.      According to ""The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows"" (8th Edition, pg. 495), Wayne was the first choice to play Marshal Matt Dillon on Gunsmoke (1955), but declined because he did not want to commit to a weekly TV series. He did, however, recommend his friend James Arness for the role, and gave the on-camera introduction in the pilot episode. In reality Wayne was never offered a TV series in the mid-1950s as he was a major movie star.      His performance as Ethan Edwards in The Searchers (1956) is ranked #87 on Premiere Magazine\'s 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006).      After meeting the late Superman (1978) star Christopher Reeve at the 1979 Academy Awards, Wayne turned to Cary Grant and said, ""This is our new man. He\'s taking over."".      In 1973 Clint Eastwood wrote to Wayne, suggesting they star in a western together. Wayne wrote back an angry response criticizing the revisionist style and violence of Eastwood\'s latest western, High Plains Drifter (1973). Consequently Eastwood did not reply and no film was made.      His final public appearance was to present the Best Picture Oscar to The Deer Hunter (1978) at The 51st Annual Academy Awards (1979). It was not a film Wayne was fond of, since it presented a very different view of the Vietnam War than his own movie, The Green Berets (1968), had a decade earlier.      He allegedly turned down Dirty Harry (1971) because he felt the role of Harry Callahan was too far removed from his screen image. When he saw the movie he realized it wasn\'t so different from the roles he had traditionally played, and made two cop dramas of his own, McQ (1974) and Brannigan (1975). Director Don Siegel later commented, ""Wayne couldn\'t have played Harry. He was too old. He was too old to play McQ, which was a poor copy of Bullitt (1968)"".      He made three movies with Kirk Douglas, despite the fact that the two men had very different political ideologies. Wayne was a conservative Republican while Douglas was a very liberal Democrat. Wayne criticized Douglas for playing Vincent van Gogh in Lust for Life (1956), and publicly criticized him for hiring blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, one of the ""Hollywood Ten"", to write the screenplay for Spartacus (1960). Douglas later praised Wayne as a true professional who would work with anybody if he felt they were right for the part. The two made three movies together, but avoided discussing politics.      One of the most unusual Oscar moments happened when anti-war liberal Barbra Streisand presented Vietnam war hawk Wayne with his Best Actor Oscar at The 42nd Annual Academy Awards (1970).      Wayne publicly criticized director Sam Peckinpah for his film The Wild Bunch (1969), which he claimed ""destroyed the myth of the Old West"".      The inscription on the Congressional Gold Medal awarded to him in 1979 reads, simply, ""John Wayne, American.""      Although never hailed as a great actor in the classic sense, Wayne was quite accomplished on stage in high school. He even represented Glendale High School in the prestigious 1925 Southern California Shakespeare Competition, performing a passage from ""Henry VIII"".      Despite being best known as a conservative Republican, Wayne\'s politics throughout his life were fluid. He later claimed to have considered himself a socialist during his first year of college. As a young actor in Hollywood, he described himself as a liberal, and voted for Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1936 presidential election. In 1938 he attended a fund raiser for a Democratic candidate in New York, but soon afterwards ""realized Democrats didn\'t stand for the same things I did"". Henry Fonda believed Wayne called himself a liberal just so he wouldn\'t fall out with director John Ford, an activist liberal Democrat. It really wasn\'t until the 1940s that Wayne moved fully to the right on the political spectrum. But even then, he was not always in lockstep with the rest of the conservative movement - a fact that was nonetheless unknown to the public until 1978, when he openly differed with the Republican Party over the issue of the Panama Canal. Conservatives wanted America to retain full control, but Wayne, believing that the Panamanians had the right to the canal, sided with President Jimmy Carter and the Democrats to win passage of the treaty returning the canal in the Senate. Carter openly credited Wayne with being a decisive factor in convincing some Republican Senators to support the measure.      According to Michael Munn\'s ""John Wayne: The Man Behind the Myth"", in 1959, Wayne was personally told by Nikita Khrushchev, when the Soviet Premier was visiting the United States on a goodwill tour, that Joseph Stalin and China\'s Zedong Mao had each ordered Wayne to be killed. Both dictators had considered Wayne to be a leading icon of American democracy, and thus a symbol of resistance to Communism through his active support for blacklisting in Hollywood, and they believed his death would be a major morale blow to the United States. Khrushchev told Wayne he had rescinded Stalin\'s order upon his predecessor\'s demise in March 1953, but Mao supposedly continued to demand Wayne\'s assassination well into the 1960s.      His performance as Ethan Edwards in The Searchers (1956) is ranked #23 on Premiere Magazine\'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.      After seeing Wayne\'s performance in Red River (1948), directed by rival director Howard Hawks, John Ford is quoted as saying, ""I never knew the big son of a bitch could act.""      During his conservative political speeches in the late 1960s and early 1970s, students opposed to his political stances would often walk out of or boycott university film classes that screened his films.      Returned to Harvard in January 1974, at the height of his political activism, for a celebrity roast of himself. During the ceremony, the head said, ""We\'re not here to make fun of you, we\'re here to hurt your feelings."" Later, Wayne said jokingly, ""You know, I accepted this invitation over a wonderful invitation to a Jane Fonda rally."".      Wore a toupee in every film from Wake of the Red Witch (1948) for the rest of his illustrious career.During the filming of The Wings of Eagles (1957) he didn\'t wear it at all for the latter part of the film, showing the character in later life. Wayne\'s hairpiece can be seen to fall off during a fight scene in North to Alaska (1960).      Following his retirement from making movies in 1976, Wayne received thousands of letters from fans who accused him of selling out by advertising insurance in television commercials. Wayne responded that the six-figure sum he was offered to star in the advertisements was too good to refuse.      It was no surprise that Wayne would become such an enduring icon. By the early 1970s his contemporaries Humphrey Bogart, Tyrone Power, Errol Flynn, Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Paul Muni and Gary Cooper were dead. James Cagney and Cary Grant both retired from acting at 62. The careers of other stars declined considerably--both Henry Fonda and James Stewart ended up working on television series that wound up being canceled. Wayne, however, continued to star in movies until 1976, remaining one of the top ten US box-office stars until 1974.      The fact that all three of his wives were Latin-American surprised Hollywood; this was the only ""non-American"" aspect of his life. ""I have never been conscious of going for any particular type,"" Wayne said in response to a challenge from the press, ""it\'s just a happenstance"".      Wayne\'s westerns were full of action but usually not excessively violent. ""Fights with too much violence are dull,"" claimed Wayne, insisting that the straight-shooting, two-fisted violence in his movies have been ""sort of tongue-in-cheek."" He described the violence in his films as ""lusty and a little humorous,"" based on his belief that ""humor nullifies violence."" His conservative taste deplored the increasing latitude given to violence and sex in Hollywood. In the 1960s he launched a campaign against what he termed ""Hollywood\'s bloodstream polluted with perversion and immoral and amoral nuances."" Most of his westerns steered clear of graphic violence.      Wayne tried not to make films that exploited sex or violence, deploring the vulgarity and violence in Rosemary\'s Baby (1968), which he saw and did not like, and A Clockwork Orange (1971) or Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972) which he had no desire to see. He thought Deep Throat (1972) was repulsive - ""after all, it\'s pretty hard to take your daughter to see it."" And he refused to believe that Love Story (1970) ""sold because the girl went around saying \'shit\' all the way through it."" Rather, ""the American public wanted to see a little romantic story."" He took a strong stance against nudity: ""No one in any of my pictures will ever be served drinks by a girl with no top to her dress."" It was not sex per se he was against. ""Don\'t get me wrong. As far as a man and a woman are concerned, I\'m awfully happy there\'s a thing called sex,"" he said, ""It\'s an extra something God gave us, but no picture should feature the word in an unclear manner."" He therefore saw ""no reason why it shouldn\'t be in pictures,"" but it had to be ""healthy, lusty sex.""      During a visit to London in January 1974 to appear on The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour (1969) and Parkinson (1971), Wayne caught pneumonia. For a 66-year-old man with one lung this was very serious, and eventually he was coughing so hard that he damaged a valve in his heart. This problem went undetected until March 1978, when he underwent emergency open heart surgery in Boston. Bob Hope delivered a message from the The 50th Annual Academy Awards (1978), saying, ""We want you to know Duke, we miss you tonight. We expect you to amble out here in person next year, because there is nobody who can fill John Wayne\'s boots."" According to Loretta Young, that message from Hope made Wayne determined to live long enough to attend the Oscars in 1979.      On Friday, January 12th, 1979, Wayne entered hospital for gall bladder surgery, which turned in a nine and a half hour operation when doctors discovered cancer in his stomach. His entire stomach was removed. On May 2nd, Wayne returned to the hospital, where the cancer was found to have spread to his intestines. He was taken to the 9th floor of the UCLA Medical Center, where President Jimmy Carter visited him, and Queen Elizabeth II sent him a get well card. He went into a coma on Sunday, June 10th, 1979, and died at 5:35 P.M., in the late afternoon the next day, Monday, June 11th, 1979.      Although it has often been written that Wayne was dying of cancer when he made The Shootist (1976), his final film, this is not actually true. Following the removal of his entire left lung in 1964, he was cancer-free for the next 12 years. It wasn\'t until Christmas 1978 that he fell seriously ill again, and in January of the following year the cancer was found to have returned.      Ranked in the top four box office stars, as ranked by Quigley Publications\' annual poll of the Top Ten Money Making Stars, an astounding 19 times from 1949 to 1972. (Only Clint Eastwood, with 21 appearances in the Top 10 to the Duke\'s 25, has been in the Top 10, let alone the top four, more times.) He made the top three a dozen times, the top two nine times, and was the #1 box office champ four times (1950, \'51, \'54 and 1971).      Was named the #1 box office star in North America by Quigley Publications, which has published its annual Top 10 Poll of Money-Making Stars since 1932. In all, the Duke was named to Quigley Publications\' annual Top 10 Poll a record 25 times. (Clint Eastwood, with 25 appearances in the Top 10, is #2, and Wayne\'s contemporary Gary Cooper, with 18 appearances, is tied for #3 with Tom Cruise.) Wayne had the longest ride on the list, first appearing on it in 1949 and making it every year but one (1958) through 1974. In four of those years he was No. 1.      In a 1960 interview Wayne criticized the homosexual themes of Suddenly, Last Summer (1959) and They Came to Cordura (1959).      Wayne appeared in a very uncomplimentary light in the Public Enemy song ""Fight the Power,"" from the 1990 album ""Fear of a Black Planet"". Wayne has frequently come under fire for alleged racist remarks he made about black people and Native American Indians in his infamous Playboy magazine interview from May 1971. He was also criticized by some for supporting Senator Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election, after Goldwater had voted against the Civil Rights Act. However; it turned out that Goldwater was not as intolerant as people thought, and was quite progressive in his thinking on integration, but hindsight tends to rule the day.      Wayne denounced the subject of homosexuality in Tennessee Williams\' Suddenly, Last Summer (1959) as ""too disgusting even for discussion""--even though he had not seen it and had no intention of seeing it. ""It is too distasteful,"" he claimed, ""to be put on a screen designed to entertain a family, or any member of a decent family."" He considered the youth-oriented, anti-establishment film Easy Rider (1969) and Midnight Cowboy (1969), which to his dismay won the Best Picture Oscar in 1970, as ""perverted"" films. Especially when early in ""Midnight Cowboy"" Jon Voight dons his newly acquired Western duds and, posing in front of a mirror, utters the only words likely to come to mind at the moment one becomes a cowboy: ""John Wayne!"" Wayne told Playboy magazine, ""Wouldn\'t you say that the wonderful love of these two men in \'Midnight Cowboy\', a story about two fags, qualifies as a perverse movie?"".      In 1971, owing to the success of Big Jake (1971), he was #1 at the US box office for the last time.      By the early 1960s, 161 of his films had grossed $350 million, and he had been paid as much as $666,000 to make a movie.      Due to his political activism, in 1968 Wayne was asked to be the segregationist Governor of Alabama George Wallace\'s running mate in that year\'s presidential election. Wayne\'s response made headlines: ""Wayne Wallace candidates? Wayne SAID \'B------t!\'"", as if he was shouting to the reporters.      While visiting the troops in Vietnam in June 1966, a bullet struck Wayne\'s bicycle. Although he was not within 100 yards of it at the time, the newspapers reported he had narrowly escaped death at the hands of a sniper.      In December 1978, just a month before he was diagnosed with stomach cancer, he joined Bob Hope and Johnny Carson in offering his services to speak out publicly against government corruption, poverty, crime and drug abuse.      Producer-director Robert Rossen offered the role of Willie Stark in All the King\'s Men (1949) to Wayne. Rossen sent a copy of the script to Wayne\'s agent, Charles K. Feldman,who forwarded it to Wayne. After reading the script, Wayne sent it back with an angry letter attached. In it, he told Feldman that before he sent the script to any of his other clients, he should ask them if they wanted to star in a film that ""smears the machinery of government for no purpose of humor or enlightenment"", that ""degrades all relationships"", and that is populated by ""drunken mothers; conniving fathers; double-crossing sweethearts; bad, bad, rich people; and bad, bad poor people if they want to get ahead."" He accused Rossen of wanting to make a movie that threw acid on ""the American way of life."" If Feldman had such clients, Wayne wrote that the agent should ""rush this script . . . to them."" Wayne, however, said to the agent that ""you can take this script and shove it up Robert Rossen\'s derriere."" Wayne later remarked that ""to make Huey Long a wonderful, rough pirate was great, but, according to this picture, everybody was shit except for this weakling intern doctor who was trying to find a place in the world."" Broderick Crawford, who had played a supporting role in Wayne\'s Seven Sinners (1940),eventually got the part of Stark. In a bit of irony, Crawford was Oscar-nominated for the part of Stark and found himself competing against Wayne, who was nominated the same year for Sands of Iwo Jima (1949). Crawford won the Best Actor Oscar.      His image was so far-reaching that when Emperor Hirohito visited America in 1975, he asked to meet the veteran star. Wayne was quoted in the Chicago Sun Times as saying, ""I must have killed off the entire Japanese army.""      Allegedly thrust his Best Actor Oscar for True Grit (1969) to Richard Burton at the The 42nd Annual Academy Awards (1970), telling the Welsh actor, ""You should have this, not me.""      During the Vietnam War he was highly critical of teenagers who went to Europe to dodge the draft, calling them ""cowards"", ""traitors"" and ""communists"".      Despite his numerous alleged anti-gay remarks in interviews over the years,Wayne co-starred with Rock Hudson in The Undefeated (1969), even though he knew of the actor\'s homosexuality. In this Civil War epic, the champion of political conservatism worked well with and even became good friends with Hudson, Hollywood\'s gayest (although it wasn\'t publicly known at the time) leading man.They remained good friends until Wayne\'s death in 1979.      In 1971 Wayne and James Stewart were traveling to Ronald Reagan\'s second inauguration as Governor of California when they encountered some anti-war demonstrators with a Vietcong flag. Stewart\'s stepson Ronald had been killed in Vietnam in 1969. Wayne walked over to speak to the protesters and within minutes the flag had been lowered.      In the final years of his life, with the resignation of President Richard Nixon and the end of the Vietnam War, Wayne\'s political beliefs appeared to have moderated. He attended the inauguration of President Jimmy Carter on 20 January 1977, and along with his fellow conservative James Stewart he could be seen applauding Jane Fonda at The American Film Institute Salute to Henry Fonda (1978). Later in 1978, Wayne uncharacteristically sided with the Democrats and President Carter against his fellow conservative Republicans over the issue of the Panama Canal, which Wayne believed belonged to the people of Panama and not the United States of America.      Offered Charlton Heston the roles of Jim Bowie and Col. William Travis in The Alamo (1960), saying the young actor would be ideal for either part. Heston declined the offer because he did not want to be directed by Wayne, and because he feared the critical response to the ideologically conservative movie. Wayne intended the epic to be an allegory for America\'s Cold War with the Soviet Union.      Separated from his wife Pilar Wayne in 1973, though they never divorced. When Louis Johnson, his business partner, sold all of their holdings in Arizona, The 26 Bar Ranch and the Red River Land and Cattle Company, Wayne\'s children got one half of it, $24,000,000. Pilar had already been taken care of at their separation.      Although media reports suggested he was to attend Elvis Presley\'s funeral in August 1977, Wayne didn\'t show up for it. Presley had once been considered for Glen Campbell\'s role in True Grit (1969). The reason Presley did not appear in the film, was that his manager told Wayne that the only way Presley would appear is for and outrageous sum of money, plus top billing OVER Wayne, so needless to say, those demands were not met.      Re-mortgaged his house in Hollywood in order to finance The Alamo (1960). While the movie was a success internationally, it lost him a great deal of money personally. For the next four years he had to make one film after another, including The Longest Day (1962), for which he was paid $250,000 for four days work. By early 1962 his financial problems were resolved.      Honored with an Army RAH-66 helicopter, named ""The Duke"". Many people attended the naming ceremony in Washington, DC, on May 12, 1998, including his children and grandchildren, congressmen, the president of the USO Metropolitan Washington, dignitaries and many military personnel. His eldest son Michael Wayne said at the ceremony, ""John Wayne loved his country and he loved its traditions"".      In 1973 he was honored with the Veterans of Foreign Wars highest award The National Americanism Gold Medal.      Produced and starred in a 1940s radio show about an alcoholic detective titled ""Three Sheets to the Wind"".      When he was honored with a square at the Grauman\'s Chinese Theater in Hollywood the sand used in the cement was brought in from Iwo Jima, in honor of his film Sands of Iwo Jima (1949).      ""The Greatest Cowboy Star of All Time"" was the caption to a series of comic books dedicated to him. The ""John Wayne Adventure Comics"" were first published in 1949.      His image appeared on a wide variety of products including: 1950 popcorn trading cards given at theaters, 1951 Camel cigarettes, 1956 playing cards, Whitman\'s Chocolates and - posthumously - Coors beer. The money collected on the Coors beer cans with his image went to the John Wayne Cancer Institute. One of the most unusual was as a puppet on H.R. Pufnstuf (1969), who also put out a 1970 lunch box with his image among the other puppet characters.Barry Goldwater visited the set of Stagecoach (1939) during filming. They had a long friendship and in 1964 Wayne helped in Goldwater\'s presidential campaign.      After his third wife Pilar Wayne left him in 1973, Wayne became (happily) involved with his secretary Pat Stacy for the remaining six years of his life.      Cited as America\'s favorite movie star in a Harris Poll conducted in 1995.      In his films Wayne often surrounded himself with a group of friends/fellow actors (often unknown names but recognized faces), such as Ward Bond, Jim Hutton, Bruce Cabot, Ben Johnson, Edward Faulkner, Jay C. Flippen, Richard Boone, Chuck Roberson and his son, Patrick Wayne.      Directed most of The Comancheros (1961) because credited director Michael Curtiz was dying of cancer and was often too ill to work. Wayne refused to be credited as a co-director.      Gave the eulogy at the funerals of Ward Bond, John Ford and Howard Hawks.      Had plastic surgery to remove the lines around his eyes in 1969, which left him with black eyes and forced him to wear dark glasses for two weeks. He also had surgery to remove the jowls around his mouth.      Worked with Robert Mitchum\'s youngest son Christopher Mitchum in three films, Chisum (1970), Rio Lobo (1970) and Big Jake (1971). Wayne had intended on Christopher becoming part of his regular stock company of supporting actors, but fell out with him in 1973 in an argument over politics. Wayne told him, ""I didn\'t know you was a pinko."".      Some of his films during the mid-1950s were less successful, forcing Wayne to work with pop singers in order to attract young audiences. He acted alongside Ricky Nelson in Rio Bravo (1959), Frankie Avalon in The Alamo (1960) and Fabian in North to Alaska (1960).      Wayne was buried in secret and the grave went unmarked until 1999, in case Vietnam War protesters desecrated the site. Twenty years after his death he finally received a headstone made of bronze which was engraved with a quotation from his infamous Playboy interview.      Wayne nearly got into a fight with British film critic Barry Norman on two occasions, both times over politics. In November 1963, on the set of Circus World (1964), the two had a serious argument over Barry Goldwater\'s presidential campaign. Nearly six years later, while Wayne was promoting True Grit (1969), the two nearly came to blows on a train over the Vietnam War. Despite this, Norman wrote favorably of Wayne as an actor in his book ""The Hollywood Greats"" (1986).      Listed in the 1910 U.S. Census as Marion R. Morrison, living with his parents in Madison, Iowa.      In 1920, lived at 404 N. Isabel Street, Glendale, California, according to U.S. Census.      While filming True Grit (1969), Wayne was trying to keep his weight off with drugs - uppers for the day, downers to sleep at night. Occasionally, he got the pills mixed up, and this led to problems on a The Dean Martin Show (1965) taping in 1969. Instead of taking an upper before leaving for the filming, he took a downer - and was ready to crash by the time he arrived on the set. ""I can\'t do our skit,"" Wayne reportedly told Martin when it was time to perform. ""I\'m too doped up. Goddamn, I look half smashed!"" Naturally, Martin didn\'t have a problem with that. ""Hell, Duke, people think I do the show that way all the time!"" The taping went on as scheduled.      Although he actively supported Ronald Reagan\'s failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976, Wayne paid a visit to the White House as a guest of President Jimmy Carter for his inauguration. ""I\'m pleased to be present and accounted for in this capital of freedom to witness history as it happens - to watch a common man accept the uncommon responsibility he won \'fair and square\' by stating his case to the American people - not by bloodshed, be-headings, and riots at the palace gates. I know I\'m a member of the loyal opposition - accent on the loyal. I\'d have it no other way."".Pilar Wayne wrote in her book ""My Life with The Duke"": ""Duke always said family came first, career second, and his interest in politics third. In fact, although he loved the children and me, there were times when we couldn\'t compete with his career or his devotion to the Republican Party."".      After Ronald Reagan\'s election as Governor of California in 1966, Wayne was exiting a victory celebration when he was asked by police not to leave the building - a mob of 300 angry anti-war demonstrators were waiting outside. Instead of cowering indoors, Wayne confronted the demonstrators head on. When protesters waved the Viet Cong flag under his nose, Wayne grew impatient. ""Please don\'t do that fellows,"" Duke warned the assembled. ""I\'ve seen too many kids your age wounded or dead because of that flag. So I don\'t take too kindly to it."" The demonstrators persisted, so he chased a group of them down an alley.      In 1975, for the first time since his arrival in Hollywood 47 years earlier, he did not act in any movies. Production began in January of the following year for his last, The Shootist (1976).      In 1967 Wayne wrote to Democratic President Lyndon Johnson requesting military assistance for his pro-war film about Vietnam. Jack Valenti told the President, ""Wayne\'s politics are wrong, but if he makes this film he will be helping us."" Wayne got enough firepower to make The Green Berets (1968), which became one of the most controversial movies of all time.      In 1960 Frank Sinatra hired a blacklisted screenwriter, Albert Maltz, to write an anti-war screenplay for a film to be called ""The Execution of Private Slovik"", based on a William Bradford Huie book about the only US soldier to be executed for desertion during World War II. Wayne, who had actively supported the Joseph McCarthy anti-Communist witch hunts for nearly 20 years, recalled, ""When I heard about it, I was so goddamn mad I told a reporter, \'I wonder how Sinatra\'s crony, Senator John F. Kennedy, feels about Sinatra hiring such a man\'. The whole thing became a minefield . . . I heard that Kennedy put pressure on Frank and he had to back down . . . He ended up paying Maltz $75,000 not to write the goddamn thing"". The film wasn\'t made for another 14 years (The Execution of Private Slovik (1974)).      Campaigned for Sam Yorty in the 1969 election for Mayor of Los Angeles.      His great-nephew Tommy Morrison was diagnosed with HIV in 1996.      Announced his intention to campaign for Senator Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election after Goldwater had voted against the Civil Rights Act. Although diagnosed with lung cancer and forced to undergo major surgery in September, Wayne still managed to host a TV special for Goldwater in October.      Directed most of Big Jake (1971) himself because director George Sherman, an old friend from Wayne\'s days at Republic, was in his mid-60s and ill at the time, and not up to the rigors of directing an action picture in the wilds of Mexico, where much of the film was shot. Wayne refused to take co-director credit.      His TV appearances in the late 1960s showed that Wayne had overcome his indifference to television. In addition to appearing on The Dean Martin Show (1965), The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour (1969), he became a semi-regular visitor to Laugh-In (1967), often good-naturedly spoofing his macho image and even dressing up as The Easter Bunny in a famous 1972 episode.      After he finally won the Best Actor Oscar for True Grit (1969) his career declined. Chisum (1970), seemingly having little to do with Wayne, was released to mixed reviews and moderate business. Rio Lobo (1970) received very poor critical reception and proved to be a commercial disappointment. Big Jake (1971), pumped up with graphic action scenes and plenty of humor, made twice as much money as either of the previous two films. However, The Cowboys (1972) struggled to find an audience when first released, despite the fact that it received positive reviews and featured a very different performance from Wayne as an aging cattleman. The Train Robbers (1973) was largely forgettable and Cahill U.S. Marshal (1973) garnered him his worst reviews since The Conqueror (1956). His attempts to emulate Clint Eastwood as a tough detective were generally ridiculed due to his age, increasing weight and the predictable nature of the plots. McQ (1974) was only a moderate success and Brannigan (1975), although it was a better picture, made even less money. A sequel to True Grit (1969) titled Rooster Cogburn (1975), co-starring Katharine Hepburn, was critically reviled, but managed to be a minor hit. For the first time Wayne gave serious thought to retirement; however, he was able to make one final movie, a stark story of a gunfighter dying of cancer called The Shootist (1976) which, although Wayne received some of the best reviews of his career, struggled to get its money back.      Wayne did not serve during World War II. Knee injuries he received in college kept him from running the distances required by military standards.      Was a member of the conservative John Birch Society.      Campaigned for Gerald Ford in the 1976 presidential election.      At the Memorial Day finale at Knott\'s Berry Farm in Anaheim in 1964, Wayne and Rock Hudson flanked Ronald Reagan as the future President led 27,000 Goldwater enthusiasts in a roaring Pledge of Allegiance.      In 1965, after his battle with lung cancer, Wayne moved out of Hollywood to Newport Beach, where he lived until his death 14 years later. His house was demolished after he died.      During the early 1960s Wayne traveled extensively to Panama. During this time, the star reportedly purchased the island of Taborcillo off the main coast of Panama. It was sold by his estate after his death and changed many hands before being opened as a tourist attraction.Lauren Bacall once recalled that while Wayne hardly knew her husband Humphrey Bogart at all, he was the first to send flowers and good wishes after Bogart was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in January 1956.      Along with Humphrey Bogart, Wayne was regarded as the heaviest smoker in Hollywood, sustaining five packs of unfiltered Camels until his first battle with cancer in 1964. While recovering from losing his lung he began to chew tobacco, and then he started smoking cigars.      He lost the leading role in The Gunfighter (1950) to Gregory Peck because of his refusal to work for Columbia Pictures after Columbia chief Harry Cohn had mistreated him years before as a young contract player (Cohn had heard a rumor, which turned out to be untrue, that Waynel was pursuing a young starlet that Cohn was already having an affair with, and had him blackballed among the other Hollywood studios). Cohn had bought the _""The Gunfighter"" project specifically with Wayne in mind for it, but Wayne\'s grudge was too deep, and Cohn sold the script to Twentieth Century-Fox, which cast Peck in the role Wayne badly wanted but refused to bend for. When the Reno Chamber of Commerce named Peck the top western star for 1950 and presented him with the Silver Spurs award, an angry Wayne said, ""Well, who the hell decided that you were the best cowboy of the year?"". Wayne also reportedly turned down the lead in ""Twelve O\'Clock High,"" which also became an iconic part for Peck.      He was badly sunburnt while filming 3 Godfathers (1948) and was briefly hospitalized.Robert Aldrich, then president of the Directors Guild of America, stated in support of awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Wayne in 1979: ""It is important for you to know that I am a registered Democrat and, to my knowledge, share none of the political views espoused by Duke. However, whether he is ill- disposed or healthy, John Wayne is far beyond the normal political sharp-shooting in this community. Because of his courage, his dignity, his integrity, and because of his talents as an actor, his strength as a leader, his warmth as a human being throughout his illustrious career, he is entitled to a unique spot in our hearts and minds. In this industry, we often judge people, sometimes unfairly, by asking whether they have paid their dues. John Wayne has paid his dues over and over, and I\'m proud to consider him a friend, and am very much in favor of my Government recognizing in some important fashion the contribution that Mr. Wayne has made."".      He regarded Rio Bravo (1959) as the film marking his transition into middle age. At 51 Wayne was starting to get overweight and he believed he was too old to play the romantic lead any more. His last four movies since The Searchers (1956) had been unsuccessful, and he felt the only way to keep audiences coming was to revert to playing ""John Wayne"" in every film.      Broke his leg while filming Legend of the Lost (1957).      Fittingly, Wayne was buried in Orange County, the most Republican district in the United States. The conservative residents admired Wayne so much that they named their international airport after him. It is about four miles from the cemetery where he is buried.      At one time Wayne was considered for Rock Hudson\'s role as rancher Bick Benedict in George Stevens\'s epic western Giant (1956).      He had intended to make a trilogy of films featuring the character Rooster Cogburn, but the third film was canceled after Rooster Cogburn (1975) proved to be only a moderate hit at the box office. The third film was intended to be called ""Sometime"".      In the mid-1930s Wayne was hired by Columbia Pictures to make several westerns for its ""B"" unit. Columbia chief Harry Cohn, a married man, soon got the idea that Wayne had made a pass at a Columbia starlet with whom Cohn was having an affair. When he confronted Wayne about it Wayne denied it, but Cohn called up executives at other studios and told them that Wayne would show up for work drunk, was a womanizer and a troublemaker and requested that they not hire him. Wayne didn\'t work for several months afterward, and when he discovered what Cohn had done, he burst into Cohn\'s office at Columbia, grabbed him by the neck and threatened to kill him. After he cooled off he told Cohn that ""as long as I live, I will never work one day for you or Columbia no matter how much you offer me."" Later, after Wayne had become a major star, he received several lucrative film offers from Columbia, including the lead in The Gunfighter (1950), all of which he turned down cold. Even after Cohn died in 1958, Wayne still refused to entertain any offers whatsoever from Columbia Pictures, including several that would have paid him more than a a million dollars.      The Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, issued a proclamation making 26 May 2007 ""John Wayne Day"" in California.      Bought a 135-foot yacht called ""The Wild Goose"" in 1962. Wayne agreed to make Circus World (1964), a film he hated, just so he could sail the vessel to Europe.      In 1962 he was paid a record $250,000 for four days work on The Longest Day (1962), and in the following year he was paid the same amount for two days work on The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965).      On 20 August 2007, the Republican Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver announced that Wayne will be inducted into the California Hall of Fame located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts in Sacramento on 5 December 2007.      After undergoing major lung surgery in 1964, Wayne would sometimes have to use an oxygen mask to breathe for the rest of his life. An oxygen tank was always kept in his trailer on locations. His breathing problems were particularly severe on airplanes, and while filming True Grit (1969) and Rooster Cogburn (1975), due to the high altitude. No photographs were allowed to be taken by the press of the veteran star breathing through an oxygen mask.      Often stated how he wished his first Oscar nomination had been for She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) instead of Sands of Iwo Jima (1949).      Ranked #11 in the 100 Most Influential People in the History of the Movies, according to the authors of the Film 100 Web site.      He has 25 appearances in the Top 10 at the US Box Office: 1949-1957 and 1959-1974.      Prior to making The Big Trail (1930), director Raoul Walsh told Wayne to take acting lessons. Wayne duly took three lessons, but gave up when the teacher told him he had no talent.      He was a member of the National Rifle Association (NRA).      Voice actor Peter Cullen based the voice of his most famous character, heroic Autobot leader Optimus Prime from Transformers (2007), on the voice of John Wayne.      In the late 1970s Wayne made a series of commercials for the Great Western Savings Bank in Los Angeles. The day after the first one aired, a man walked into a GW Bank branch in West Hollywood with a suitcase, asked to see the bank manager, and when he was shown to the manager\'s desk, he opened up the suitcase to reveal $500,000 in cash. He said, ""If your bank is good enough for John Wayne, it\'s good enough for me."" He had just closed his business and personal accounts at a rival bank down the street and walked to the GW branch to open accounts there because John Wayne had endorsed it.      Actor and later California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger cited Wayne as a role model from his childhood.      On Wednesday, January 25th, 1950, he became the 125th star to put his hand and footprints outside of Grauman\'s Chinese Theatre.      His Oscar win for True Grit (1969) was widely seen as more of a lifetime achievement award, since his performance had been criticized as over-the-top and hammy. In his Reader\'s Digest article on Wayne from October 1979, Ronald Reagan wrote that the award was both in recognition of his whole career, and to make up for him not receiving nominations for Red River (1948), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and The Searchers (1956).The Shootist (1976) is widely considered the best final film by any major star, rivaled only by Clark Gable\'s role in The Misfits (1961) and Henry Fonda\'s role in On Golden Pond (1981).      During his career his movies grossed an estimated half a billion dollars worldwide.      Spoilers: Of the near 200 films Wayne made, he died in only eight: Reap the Wild Wind (1942) (octopus attack), The Fighting Seabees (1944) (gunshot/explosion), Wake of the Red Witch (1948) (drowning), Sands of Iwo Jima (1949) (gunshot wounds), The Alamo (1960) (lance/explosion), The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) (natural causes), The Cowboys (1972) (gunshot wounds) and The Shootist (1976) (shotgun wounds). His fate in The Sea Chase (1955) is undetermined - he may have died when his ship sank, or he (and Lana Turner) may have made it to shore.      His father died of a heart attack in March 1937.      He very much wanted the role of Wild Bill Hickok in The Plainsman (1936), which he felt certain would make him a star, but director Cecil B. DeMille wanted Gary Cooper instead.Michael Caine recalled in his 1992 autobiography ""What\'s It All About?"" that Wayne gave him two pieces of advice when they first met in Hollywood early in 1967. Firstly, on acting, Wayne told him, ""Talk low, talk slow, and don\'t talk too much."" Then Wayne added, ""And never wear suede shoes. One time I was taking a piss when a guy next to me turned round and said, \'John Wayne!\', and pissed all over my shoes."".      His first wife Josephine Alicia Saenz died of cancer in 2003, at the age of 94.      Actors Steve McQueen, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Chuck Norris all cited Wayne as a huge influence on them, both professionally and personally. Like Wayne, each man rose to fame playing men of heroic action. Also, like Wayne, each man is a supporter of conservative causes and the Republican party, the exception being McQueen who, although a lifelong Republican, died in 1980.      Gave Sammy Davis Jr. the first cowboy hat he ever wore in a film.      After leaving the stage, during 1979\'s Academy Awards ceremony, he was greeted by his old pal Sammy Davis Jr., who gave him a big bear hug. Davis later told a friend he regretted hugging Wayne so hard in his fragile condition, but he was told that ""Duke Wouldn\'t have missed that hug for anything"" (the idea of the 125-pound Davis worrying about hugging him ""too hard"" was a sad commentary on Wayne\'s failing health).      Wayne was asked to be the running mate for Alabama Governor George Wallace, who was running for the US presidency on a segregationist ticket in 1968, but Wayne vehemently rejected the offer and actively campaigned for Richard Nixon. He addressed the Republican National Convention on its opening day in August 1968.      In his later years Wayne lived near Newport Beach, just south of Los Angeles, where he had a beach house and a yacht, ""The Wild Goose"". His house has been torn down, but The Wild Goose sails on. It\'s now a tour boat offering dinner cruises to Wayne fans young and old alike. Originally a decommissioned Navy minesweeper, it was rebuilt and customized by Wayne as a yacht; the custom interior has polished wood almost everywhere you look. It was there that in his later years he often entertained, hosting card games with his good friends Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and other name stars of the time.      On Monday, May 18th, 1953, during divorce proceedings from his second wife Esperanza Baur, Wayne\'s annual gross income was publicly revealed to be $502,891.      Visited Stepin Fetchit in hospital in 1976 after the actor had suffered a stroke which ended his career.      He considered Maureen O\'Hara one of his best friends; over the years he was more open to her than anyone. When asked about her he always replied, ""The greatest guy I ever knew."" They were friends for 39 years, from 1940 until his death in 1979. Today she is considered by many to be his best leading lady; they starred in five films together. She referred to a wing in her home as the ""John Wayne Wing"".      Great Western Savings erected a bronze statue by Harry Jackson of Wayne on a horse at its headquarters in Beverly Hills. Although the building was later bought by Larry Flynt, the statue still stands at its original location.      He appeared in at least one film for every year from 1926-76, a record of 51 consecutive years. He did not act in a movie in 1975, though both Brannigan (1975) and Rooster Cogburn (1975) were released in that year.      Aa a young man, Ethan Wayne was never allowed to leave the house without carrying cards that his father had autographed to hand out to fans.      According to Mel Brooks in his commentary of Blazing Saddles (1974), he wanted Wayne as The Waco Kid. Wayne told Brooks that he thought the script was ""funny as hell"", but said it was ""too dirty,"" and his fans would never accept him in the role. He also said he would do anything he could to help him get the picture made, and be the first in line to see it when it came out.      In 1959 he was considered for the role of the sergeant in a film that director Samuel Fuller wanted to make about his war experiences, ""The Big Red One"". When the film was finally made in 1980, The Big Red One (1980), the role went to Lee Marvin after Fuller asked that Wayne be replaced so as not to overshadow his film\'s story.      In the DVD documentary for 1941 (1979), Steven Spielberg says he first met Wayne at the memorial service for Joan Crawford. The two became friends and Spielberg offered the role of Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell to Wayne. He sent Wayne the script and got a call back the same day, criticizing Spielberg for making a film that Wayne felt was anti-American. The two remained friends and never discussed the film again. Spielberg says that later on Wayne pitched him a script idea about a camel race in Morocco starring Wayne and long-time friend and co-star Maureen O\'Hara. Spielberg says it sounded like a good idea. However, Wayne later passed away and the film was never made.      Longtime friend of Harry Morgan.      Was a Boy Scout.      Was the acting mentor to actor James Arness.      In April 2014, he was honored as Turner Classic Movie\'s Star of the Month.      When wife Chata charged that Wayne had an affair with Gail Russell in their divorce proceedings, the actor countered that Nicky Hilton Rothschild had become a constant house-guest of Chata\'s.      In response to the Californian senate voting against celebrating May 26 as ""John Wayne Day"" in 2016, the state of Texas declared that it would celebrate ""John Wayne Day"".      Wayne\'s name consistently came up over the years for proposals that he portray WWII General George S. Patton. Through the 1950\'s studios proposed films about Patton, but Patton\'s family objected to such projects and objected to Wayne specifically. In the mid 1960\'s he was director \'Michael Anderson\'\'s choice to play Patton in a Columbia Pictures epic, ""16th of December: The Battle of the Bulge"", which had the blessing of Eisenhower and the Defence Department, but the project was abandoned after Warner Brothers appropriated the title Battle of the Bulge (1965) for a generic war film with Henry Fonda. Finally Wayne was considered in the role for Patton (1970) ultimately played by George C. Scott, turning it down at one point, a decision he reportedly later regretted.      Is portrayed by David James Elliott in Trumbo (2015).      Often billed as 6\'4"", although Wayne said his exact height was 6\'3 3/4"".      Shortly before he began filming Legend of the Lost (1957) Wayne was devastated when the US government sided with the Soviet Union during the Suez Crisis, and took no action in response to the Soviet invasion of Hungary. Wayne believed Richard Nixon learned from the mistakes of November 1956 to correctly handle the Yom Kippur War in 1973.      In 2014 Marc Eliot\'s book ""American Titan: Searching for John Wayne"" alleged that Wayne deliberately avoided enlisting in the armed forces during World War II because he was afraid it would end the affair he was having with Marlene Dietrich. He also feared military service might end his career as he would be too old to be ""an action-oriented leading man"".      According to the families of John Wayne, legendary directory John Ford, and Harry Carey Jr., Wayne\'s iconic ""rolling walk"" was developed during the filming of the classic Stagecoach (1939) by Duke and character actor Paul Fix, Carey\'s father-in-law (who wasn\'t in the film). This walk helped set Wayne apart from everyone else, and gave him more of an ""edge"" over other male actors of the day.      He appeared as a guest on the second episode of The Dean Martin Show (1965).      In 1960 he publicly condemned Frank Sinatra for trying to make a film version of ""The Execution of Private Slovik"" to be written by the blacklisted screenwriter Albert Maltz. Sinatra was forced to abandon the project after pressure from John F. Kennedy, whose presidential campaign he was actively supporting.      One of the referendum issues on the California ballot in the 1972 elections was a proposition that would have rigidly codified public obscenity laws, encouraging arrests of pornography peddlers. Wayne, and nearly two thirds of California\'s voters, found the proposition repressive and untenable. In a radio commercial he told voters, ""You don\'t get rid of a bad situation with a badly written law, or cut off a foot to cure a sore toe."".      He separated from his third wife Pilar in 1967 while he was filming The Green Berets (1968). However they did not publicly announce their separation until 1973.      Plans to declare 26 May as John Wayne Day in California were rejected in April 2016 over allegedly racist comments the actor made in his May 1971 interview with ""Playboy"" magazine. In a State Assembly vote several legislators objected to having a day commemorating his birthday due to his ""disturbing views towards race"". The resolution was lost by 36-19 votes.      Publicly condemned the UK for sitting out the Vietnam War.      He paid a visited to Burt Lancaster on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands where they were filming The Island of Dr. Moreau (1977). There on the set Wayne met Exotic Animal Trainers Ralph Helfer and his wife Toni Helfer where two of their black Leopards bred and gave birth on location.      He has appeared in seven movies that have been selected by the Library Of Congress for the National Film Registry as being ""culturally, historically or aesthetically"" significant. Stagecoach (1939), Red River (1948), The Quiet Man (1952), The Searchers (1956), Rio Bravo (1959), How the West Was Won (1962), The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962).

[at Harvard in 1974, on being asked whether then-President Richard Nixon ever advised him on the making of his films] No, they\'ve all been successful.      [on presenting the Best Picture Oscar in 1979] Oscar and I have something in common. Oscar first came to the Hollywood scene in 1928. So did I. We\'re both a little weatherbeaten, but we\'re still here and plan to be around for a whole lot longer.      When people say a John Wayne picture got bad reviews, I always wonder if they know it\'s a redundant sentence, but hell, I don\'t care. People like my pictures and that\'s all that counts.      [When asked if he believed in God] There must be some higher power or how else does all this stuff work?      [Time Magazine interview, 1969] I would like to be remembered, well . . . the Mexicans have a phrase, ""Feo fuerte y formal"". Which means he was ugly, strong and had dignity.      [poem, ""The Sky"", he read on his 1969 Laugh-In (1967) appearance] The sky is blue, the grass is green. Get off your ass and join the Marines.      [upon accepting his Oscar for True Grit (1969)] If I\'d known this was all it would take, I\'d have put that eyepatch on 40 years ago.      I\'m an American actor. I work with my clothes on. I have to. Riding a horse can be pretty tough on your legs and elsewheres.      [on Native Americans:] I don\'t feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them. There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves.      When I started, I knew I was no actor and I went to work on this Wayne thing. It was as deliberate a projection as you\'ll ever see. I figured I needed a gimmick, so I dreamed up the drawl, the squint and a way of moving meant to suggest that I wasn\'t looking for trouble but would just as soon throw a bottle at your head as not. I practiced in front of a mirror.      Communism is quite obviously still a threat. Yes, they are human beings, with a right to their point of view . . .      [on being asked about his ""phony hair"" at Harvard in 1974] It\'s not phony. It\'s real hair. Of course, it\'s not mine, but it\'s real.      I never had a goddamn artistic problem in my life, never, and I\'ve worked with the best of them. John Ford isn\'t exactly a bum, is he? Yet he never gave me any manure about art. He just made movies and that\'s what I do.      God-damn, I\'m the stuff men are made of!      I was overwhelmed by the feeling of friendship, comradeship, and brotherhood . . . DeMolay will always hold a deep spot in my heart.      [on the Oscars] You can\'t eat awards -- nor, more to the point, drink \'em.      I made up my mind that I was going to play a real man to the best of my ability. I felt many of the western stars of the twenties and thirties were too goddamn perfect. They never drank or smoked. They never wanted to go to bed with a beautiful girl. They never had a fight. A heavy might throw a chair at them, and they just looked surprised and didn\'t fight in this spirit. They were too goddamn sweet and pure to be dirty fighters. Well, I wanted to be a dirty fighter if that was the only way to fight back. If someone throws a chair at you, hell, you pick up a chair and belt him right back. I was trying to play a man who gets dirty, who sweats sometimes, who enjoys kissing a gal he likes, who gets angry, who fights clean whenever possible but will fight dirty if he has to. You could say I made the western hero a roughneck.      [on America] I can tell you why I love her. I have a lust for her dignity. I look at her wonderfully classic face, and I see hidden in it a sense of humor that I love. I think of wonderful, exciting, decent things when I look at her . . .      Courage is being scared to death - and saddling up anyway.      I stick to simple themes. Love. Hate. No nuances. I stay away from psychoanalyst\'s couch scenes. Couches are good for one thing.      Every country in the world loved the folklore of the West - the music, the dress, the excitement, everything that was associated with the opening of a new territory. It took everybody out of their own little world. The cowboy lasted a hundred years, created more songs and prose and poetry than any other folk figure. The closest thing was the Japanese samurai. Now, I wonder who\'ll continue it.      I am a demonstrative man, a baby picker-upper, a hugger and a kisser - that\'s my nature.      I don\'t act . . . I react.      I have found a certain type calls himself a liberal . . . Now I always thought I was a liberal. I came up terribly surprised one time when I found out that I was a right-wing conservative extremist, when I listened to everybody\'s point of view that I ever met, and then decided how I should feel. But this so-called new liberal group, Jesus, they never listen to your point of view . . .      There\'s been a lot of stories about how I got to be called Duke. One was that I played the part of a duke in a school play--which I never did. Sometimes, they even said I was descended from royalty! It was all a lot of rubbish. Hell, the truth is that I was named after a dog!      Westerns are closer to art than anything else in the motion picture business.      We must always look to the future. Tomorrow - the time that gives a man just one more chance - is one of the many things that I feel are wonderful in life. So\'s a good horse under you. Or the only campfire for miles around. Or a quiet night and a nice soft hunk of ground to sleep on. A mother meeting her first-born. The sound of a kid calling you dad for the first time. There\'s a lot of things great about life. But I think tomorrow is the most important thing. Comes in to us at midnight very clean. It\'s perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we\'ve learned something from yesterday.      I do not want the government to take away my human dignity and insure me anything more than a normal security. I don\'t want handouts.      I don\'t think a fella should be able to sit on his backside and receive welfare. I\'d like to know why well-educated idiots keep apologizing for lazy and complaining people who think the world owes them a living. I\'d like to know why they make excuses for cowards who spit in the faces of the police and then run behind the judicial sob sisters. I can\'t understand these people who carry placards to save the life of some criminal, yet have no thought for the innocent victim.      I want to play a real man in all my films, and I define manhood simply: men should be tough, fair, and courageous, never petty, never looking for a fight, but never backing down from one either.      I don\'t want ever to appear in a film that would embarrass a viewer. A man can take his wife, mother, and his daughter to one of my movies and never be ashamed or embarrassed for going.      I am an old-fashioned, honest-to-goodness, flag-waving patriot.      You can\'t whine and bellyache because somebody else got a good break and you didn\'t.      I think that the loud roar of irresponsible liberalism . . . is being quieted down by a reasoning public. I think the pendulum is swinging back. We\'re remembering that the past can\'t be so bad. We built a nation on it. We have to look to tomorrow.      Very few of the so-called liberals are open-minded . . . they shout you down and won\'t let you speak if you disagree with them.      Some people tell me everything isn\'t black and white. But I say why the hell not?High Noon (1952) was the most un-American thing I have ever seen in my whole life. The last thing in the picture is ol\' Coop [Gary Cooper] putting the United States marshal\'s badge under his foot and stepping on it. I\'ll never regret having run [screenwriter Carl Foreman] out of this country.      God, how I hate solemn funerals. When I die, take me into a room and burn me. Then my family and a few good friends should get together, have a few good belts, and talk about the crazy old time we all had together.      I\'ve always had deep faith that there is a Supreme Being, there has to be. To me that\'s just a normal thing to have that kind of faith. The fact that He\'s let me stick me around a little longer, or She\'s let me stick around a little longer, certainly goes great with me -- and I want to hang around as long as I\'m healthy and not in anybody\'s way.      I have tried to live my life so that my family would love me and my friends respect me. The others can do whatever the hell they please.      My problem is that I\'m not a handsome man like Cary Grant, who will be handsome at 65. I may be able to do a few more man-woman things before it\'s too late, but then what? I never want to play silly old men chasing young girls, as some of the stars are doing. I have to be a director - I\'ve waited all these years to be one. The Alamo (1960) will tell what my future is.      [on The Green Berets (1968)] When I saw what our boys are going through - hell - and how the morale was holding up, and the job they were doing, I just knew they had to make this picture.      I\'m quite sure that the concept of a government-run reservation would have an ill effect on anyone. But that seems to be what the socialists are working for now - to have everyone cared for from cradle to grave.      This may come as a surprise to you, but I wasn\'t alive when reservations were created - even if I do look that old. I have no idea what the best method of dealing with the Indians in the 1800s would have been. Our forefathers evidently thought they were doing the right thing.      I\'m not going to give you those I-was-a-poor-boy-and-I-pulled-myself-up-by-my-bootstraps-stories, but I\'ve gone without a meal or two in my lifetime, and I still don\'t expect the government to turn over any of its territory to me. Hard times aren\'t something I can blame my fellow citizens for. Years ago, I didn\'t have all the opportunities, either. But you can\'t whine and bellyache \'cause somebody else got a good break and you didn\'t, like these Indians are. We\'ll all be on a reservation soon if the socialists keep subsidizing groups like them with our tax money.      Look, I\'m sure there have been inequalities. If those inequalities are presently affecting any of the Indians now alive, they have a right to a court hearing. But what happened 100 years ago in our country can\'t be blamed on us today.      [asked whether the Native American Indians should be allowed to camp on their land at Alcatraz] Well, I don\'t know of anybody else who wants it. The fellas who were taken off it sure don\'t want to go back there, including the guards. So as far as I am concerned, I think we ought to make a deal with the Indians. They should pay as much for Alcatraz as we paid them for Manhattan. I hope they haven\'t been careless with their wampum.      [on Superman (1978) star Christopher Reeve after meeting him at the 1979 Academy Awards] This is our new man. He\'s taking over.      I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to the point of responsibility. I don\'t believe in giving authority and positions of leadership and judgment to irresponsible people.      Have you ever heard of some fellows who first came over to this country? You know what they found? They found a howling wilderness, with summers too hot and winters freezing, and they also found some unpleasant little characters who painted their faces. Do you think these pioneers filled out form number X6277 and sent in a report saying the Indians were a little unreasonable? Did they have insurance for their old age, for their crops, for their homes? They did not! They looked at the land, and the forest, and the rivers. They looked at their wives, their kids and their houses, and then they looked up at the sky and they said, ""Thanks, God, we\'ll take it from here.""      Don\'t ever for a minute make the mistake of looking down your nose at westerns. They\'re art--the good ones, I mean. They deal in life and sudden death and primitive struggle, and with the basic emotions--love, hate, and anger--thrown in. We\'ll have westerns films as long as the cameras keep turning. The fascination that the Old West has will never die. And as long as people want to pay money to see me act, I\'ll keep on making westerns until the day I die.      If it hadn\'t been for football and the fact I got my leg broke and had to go into the movies to eat, why, who knows, I might have turned out to be a liberal Democrat.      [on why he never wrote an autobiography] Those who like me already know me, and those who don\'t like me wouldn\'t want to read about me anyway.      I don\'t think John Ford had any kind of respect for me as an actor until I made Red River (1948) for Howard Hawks. I was never quite sure what he did think of me as an actor. I know now, though. Because when I finally won an Oscar for my role as Rooster Cogburn in True Grit (1969), Ford shook my hand and said the award was long overdue me as far as he was concerned. Right then, I knew he\'d respected me as an actor since Stagecoach (1939), even though he hadn\'t let me know it. He later told me his praise earlier, might have gone to my head and made me conceited, and that was why he\'d never said anything to me, until the right time.      I play John Wayne in every picture regardless of the character, and I\'ve been doing all right, haven\'t I?      Talk low, talk slow and don\'t talk too much.      That little clique back there in the East has taken great personal satisfaction reviewing my politics instead of my pictures. But one day those doctrinaire liberals will wake up to find the pendulum has swung the other way.      I was 32nd in the box office polls when I accepted the presidency of the Alliance [The Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a right-wing political organization he helped start]. When I left office eight years later, somehow the folks who buy the tickets had made me number one.      [on Frank Capra] I\'d like to take that little Dago son of a bitch and tear him into a million pieces and throw him into the ocean and watch him float back to Sicily where he belongs.      Television has a tendency to reach a little. In their westerns, they are getting away from the simplicity and the fact that those men were fighting the elements and the rawness of nature and didn\'t have time for this couch-work.      Mine is a rebellion against the monotony of life. The rebellion in these kids, particularly the S.D.S.-ers and those groups, seems to be a kind of dissension by rote.      Just think of it. At the Alamo there was a band of only 185 men of many nationalities and religions, all joined in a common cause for freedom. Those 185 men killed 1000 of Santa Anna\'s men before they died. But they knew they spent their lives for the precious time Sam Houston needed.      [on the studios\' blacklisting of alleged ""subversives"" in Hollywood] If it is for the FBI, I will do anything for them. If they want me to I will even be photographed with an agent and point out a Communist for them. Tell Mr. Hoover [FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover] I am on his side.      You know, I hear everybody talking about the generation gap. Frankly, sometimes I don\'t know what they\'re talking about. Heck, by now I should know a little bit about it, if I\'m ever going to. I have seven kids and 18 grandkids and I don\'t seem to have any trouble talking to any of them. Never have had, and I don\'t intend to start now.      [on The Conqueror (1956)] The way the screenplay reads, this is a cowboy picture, and that\'s how I am going to play Genghis Khan. I see him as a gunfighter.      [1979] I\'ve known Jane Fonda since she was a little girl. I\'ve never agreed with a word she\'s said, but would give my life defending her right to say it.      That Redford [Robert Redford] fellow is good. Brando [Marlon Brando]. Ah, Patton (1970) - George C. Scott. But the best of the bunch is Garner - James Garner. He can play anything. Comedy westerns, drama - you name it. Yeah, I have to say Garner is the best around today. He doesn\'t have to say anything just make a face and you crack up.      To me, The Wild Bunch (1969) was distasteful. It would have been a good picture without the gore. Pictures go too far when they use that kind of realism, when they have shots of blood spurting out and teeth flying, and when they throw liver out to make it look like people\'s insides. ""The Wild Bunch"" was one of the first to go that far in realism, and the curious went to see it. That may make the bankers and stock promoters think that it is a necessary ingredient for successful motion pictures. They seem to forget the one basic principle of our business - illusion. We\'re in the business of magic. I don\'t think it hurts a child to see anything that has the illusion of violence in it. All our fairy tales have some kind of violence - the good knight riding to kill the dragon, etc. Why do we have to show the knight spreading the serpent\'s guts all over the candy mountain?      I read someplace that I used to make B-pictures. Hell, they were a lot farther down the alphabet than that . . . but not as far down as R and X. I think any man who makes an X-rated picture ought to be made to take his own daughter to see it.      Screw ambiguity. Perversion and corruption masquerade as ambiguity. I don\'t trust ambiguity.      I\'m not preaching a sermon from the mount, you know. This is just my own opinion. But it does seem to me that when our industry got vulgar and cheap, we began losing our regular customers. Sure, people are curious, and they\'ll go see any provocative thing once - maybe even four or five times - but eventually they\'ll just stay home and watch television. There used to be this little Frenchman in Hollywood who made all these risqué movies . . . what the hell was his name? . . . Lubitsch [Ernst Lubitsch, who was actually German]! He could make pictures as risqué as anything you\'ll see today, but he made them with taste and illusion. The only sadness in my heart for our business is that we are taking all the illusion out of it. After all, it\'s pretty hard to take your daughter to see Deep Throat (1972).      Not that I had thoughts of becoming a song and dance man, but, like most young actors, I did want to play a variety of roles. I remember walking down the street one day, mumbling to myself about the way my career was going, when suddenly I bumped into Will Rogers. ""What\'s the matter, Duke?"" he asked, and I said things weren\'t going so well. ""You working?"" he asked, and I said, ""Yep."" ""Keep working, Duke,"" he said and smiled and walked away.      I think it was sad that Brando [Marlon Brando] did what he did. If he had something to say, he should have appeared that night and stated his views instead of taking some little unknown girl and dressing her up in an Indian outfit. What he was doing was trying to avoid the issue that was really on his mind, which was the provocative story of Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972). Let\'s just say I haven\'t made a particular point of seeing that particular picture. Brando is one of the finest actors we\'ve had in the business, and I\'m only sorry he didn\'t have the benefit of older, more established friends - as I did - to help him choose the proper material in which to use his talent.      Watergate is a sad and tragic incident in our history. They were wrong, dead wrong, those men at Watergate. Men abused power, but the system still works. Men abused money, but the system still works. Men lied and perjured themselves, but the system still works.      It\'s kind of a sad thing when a normal love of country makes you a super patriot. I do think we have a pretty wonderful country, and I thank God that He chose me to live here.      [December 1973] They\'re trying to crucify Nixon [Richard Nixon], but when they\'re writing the history of this period, Watergate will be no more than a footnote. Believe me, I have a high respect for the bulldogged way in which our President has been able to continue to administrate this government, in spite of the articulate liberal press - whose only purpose is to sell toilet paper and Toyotas - and in spite of the ambitious politicians who would deny him the help and encouragement that a man needs to face the problems of this country. I endorsed Spiro Agnew\'s attitudes, but I knew nothing of his private affairs. I was sadly disappointed to discover his feet of clay.      The only way to get 520,000 men home - men who had been practically sneaked into Vietnam in the first place - was to make the decision to mine Haiphong Harbor. President [Richard Nixon] had the courage to make that decision, and when the other side started using prisoners of war as pawns, he had to make the awesome decision to bomb Hanoi. Which he did, and then he brought our prisoners of war home. Richard Nixon and I have had a long acquaintance. I respected him as a goodly man - winning or losing over the years, and I think he should be standing in the crowningglory today for his accomplishments. Instead, they\'ve chosen to blame him for the gradual growth of hypocrisy and individual ambition that have made our political system distasteful to the public.      [on his separation from third wife Pilar Wayne in 1973] We have separated, and it\'s a sad incident in my life. It is family and personal. I\'d rather keep it that way.      [1973] My build-up was done through constant exposure. By the time I went overseas to visit our boys during the Second World War, they had already seen my movies when they were back home. Now their kids are grown up and their kids are seeing my movies. I\'m part of the family . . . I think Steve McQueen and Robert Redford have a chance of becoming lasting stars. And certainly that big kid - what the hell\'s his name? Jesus, I have such a hard time remembering my own name sometimes. Oh, you know the one I mean, that big kid, the one that\'s been directing some of his own movies lately. Yeah, that\'s the one - Clint Eastwood!      Once I was working in a movie with Harry Carey and his wife Olive [Olive Carey], and I was complaining about being typed. ""Duke,"" Ollie said, ""look at Harry over there - would you like to see Harry Carey play any other way?"". ""Of course not,"" I said. ""Well,"" Ollie said, ""the American public doesn\'t want to see you any other way, either. So wake up, Duke! Be what they want you to be."" See, I\'m not against Women\'s Lib. Ollie gave me some real good advice.John Ford was like a father to me, like a big brother. I got word that he wanted to see me at his home in Palm Springs, and when I got there, he said, ""Hi Duke, down for the deathwatch?"" ""Hell no,"" I said, ""you\'ll bury us all."" But he looked so weak. We used to be a triumvirate - Ford and me and a guy named Ward Bond. The day I went to Palm Springs, Ford said, ""Duke, do you ever think of Ward?"" ""All the time,"" I said. ""Well, let\'s have a drink to Ward,"" he said. So I got out the brandy, gave him a sip and took one for myself. ""All right, Duke,"" he said finally, ""I think I\'ll rest for a while."" I went home, and that was Pappy Ford\'s last day.      [1973] I\'ve been allowed a few more years - I hope. My lung capacity is naturally limited now, but I had a pretty good set before the disease hit me, so it isn\'t too noticeable in my everyday life.      [After failing to win the Best Actor Oscar for Sands of Iwo Jima (1949)] The best way to survive an Oscar is to never try to win another one. You\'ve seen what happens to some Oscar winners. They spend the rest of their lives turning down scripts while searching for the great role to win another one. Hell, I hope I\'m never even nominated again. It\'s meat-and-potato roles for me from now on.      [on The Alamo (1960)] This picture is America. I hope that seeing the battle of the Alamo will remind Americans that liberty and freedom don\'t come cheap. This picture, well, I guess making it has made me feel useful to my country.      [1960] I suddenly found out after 25 years I was starting out all over again. I would just about break even if I sold everything right now.      [12/29/64] I\'ve had lung cancer, the big C. But I\'ve beaten the son of a bitch. Maybe I can give some poor bastard a little hope by being honest. I want people to know cancer can be licked. My advisers all told me that the public doesn\'t want its movie heroes associated with serious illness like cancer, that it destroys their image. Well, I don\'t care much about images, and, anyway, I would have thought there was a lot better image in the fact that John Wayne had cancer and licked it.      [1966] I drink for comradeship, and when I drink for comradeship, I don\'t bother to keep count.      [1962] I\'m a progressive thinker, even though I\'m not in the liberal strain.      [1971] Get a checkup. Talk someone you like into getting a checkup. Nag someone you love into getting a checkup. And while you\'re at it, send a check to the American Cancer Society. It\'s great to be alive.      [1971] Well, you like . . . each picture for . . . a different reason. But I think my favorite will always be the next one.      [on television] I don\'t know if I love it or hate it, but there sure has never been any form of entertainment so . . . so . . . available to the human race with so little effort since they invented marital sex.      [1976] And to all you folks out there, I want to thank you for the last fifty years of my career. And I hope I can keep at it another fifty years - or at least until I can get it right.      [1979] Listen, I spoke to the man up there on many occasions and I have what I always had: deep faith that there is a Supreme Being. There has to be, you know; it\'s just to me, that\'s just a normal thing, to have that kind of faith. The fact that He\'s let me stick around a little longer certainly goes great with me, and I want to hang around as long as I\'m healthy and not in anybody\'s way.      [6/78] I\'m a greedy old man. Life\'s been good to me, and I want some more of it.      Sure I wave the American flag. Do you know a better flag to wave? Sure I love my country with all her faults. I\'m not ashamed of that, never have been, never will be. I was proud when President Nixon [Richard Nixon] ordered the mining of Haiphong Harbor, which we should have done long ago, because I think we\'re helping a brave little country defend herself against Communist invasion. That\'s what I tried to show in The Green Berets (1968) and I took plenty of abuse from the critics. Did you ever see reviews like that? Reviews with hatred and nastiness.      [his speech at The 42nd Annual Academy Awards (1970)] Wow! Ladies and gentlemen, I\'m no stranger to this podium. I\'ve come up here and picked up these beautiful golden men before, but always for friends. One night I picked up two: one for Admiral John Ford and one for our beloved Gary Cooper. I was very clever and witty that night - the envy of, even, Bob Hope. But tonight I don\'t feel very clever, very witty. I feel very grateful, very humble, and I owe thanks to many, many people. I want to thank the members of the Academy. To all you people who are watching on television, thank you for taking such warm interest in our glorious industry. Good night.      When you come slam bang up against trouble, it never looks half as bad if you face up to it.      A man\'s got to have a code, a creed to live by, no matter his job.      When the road looks rough ahead, remember the Man Upstairs and the word ""Hope"". Hang onto both and tough it out.      We\'ve made mistakes along the way, but that\'s no reason to start tearing up the best flag God ever gave to any country.      [on his third wife Pilar Wayne] I can tell you why I love her. I have a lust for her dignity. I look at her wonderfully classic face, and I see hidden in it a sense of humor that I love. I think of wonderful, exciting, decent things when I look at her.      The West - the very words go straight to that place of the heart where Americans feel the spirit of pride in their western heritage - the triumph of personal courage over any obstacle, whether nature or man.      There\'s a lot of yella bastards in the country who would like to call patriotism old-fashioned. With all that leftist activity, I was quite obviously on the other side. I was invited at first to a coupla cell meetings, and I played the lamb to listen to \'em for a while. The only guy that ever fooled me was the director Edward Dmytryk. I made a picture with him called Back to Bataan (1945). He started talking about the masses, and as soon as he started using that word - which is from their book, not ours - I knew he was a Commie.END.      My main object in making a motion picture is entertainment. If at the same time I can strike a blow for liberty, then I\'ll stick one in.      I think those blacklisted people should have been sent over to Russia. They\'d have been taken care of over there, and if the Commies ever won over here, why hell, those guys would be the first ones they\'d take care of - after me.      I said there was a tall, lanky kid that led 150 airplanes across Berlin. He was an actor, but that day, I said, he was a colonel. Colonel Jimmy Stewart [James Stewart]. So I said, ""What is all this crap about Reagan [Ronald Reagan] being an actor?""The Green Berets (1968) made $7,000,000 in the first three months of its release. This so-called intellectual group aren\'t in touch with the American people, regardless of [J. William Fulbright\'s] blatting, and Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern and Ted Kennedy. In spite of them the American people do not feel that way. Instead of taking a census, they ought to count the tickets that were sold to that picture.      In spite of the fact that Rooster Cogburn would shoot a fella between the eyes, he\'d judge that fella before he did it. He was merely trying to make the area in which he was marshal livable for the most number of people.      I wrote to the head man at General Motors and said, ""I\'m gonna have to desert you if you don\'t stop making cars for women.\'""Paul Newman would have been a much more important star if he hadn\'t always tried to be an anti-hero, to show the human feet of clay.      Contrary to what people think, I\'m no politician, and when I have something to say I say it through my movies.      [on Donovan\'s Reef (1963)] The script really called for a younger guy. I felt awkward romancing a young girl at my age.      [on Jet Pilot (1957)] It is undoubtedly one of my worst movies ever.      [on Cahill U.S. Marshal (1973)] It just wasn\'t a well done picture. It needed better writing, it needed a little better care in making.      I had the feeling my career was going to decline back in \'68. I\'d just had a big hit with The Green Berets (1968), but I wasn\'t getting any younger and I knew Hellfighters (1968) wasn\'t going to set the box office on fire. Then I read a script for a film called True Grit (1969).      [on High Plains Drifter (1973)] That isn\'t what the West was all about. That isn\'t the American people who settled this country.      [on Raoul Walsh] I\'ve been very lucky in the men I\'ve worked with. Raoul Walsh -- the heartiness and lustiness he gave to pictures I thought was tremendous.      [on They Came to Cordura (1959)] How they got Gary Cooper to do that one! To me, at least, it simply degrades the Medal of Honor. The whole story makes a mockery of America\'s highest award for valor. The whole premise of the story was wrong, illogical, because they don\'t pick the type of men the movie picked to win the award, and that can be proved by the very history of the award.      [on Republic Pictures\' chief Herbert J. Yates\' failed attempts to make a star out of wife Vera Ralston] Yates was one of the smartest businessmen I ever met. I respected him in many ways, and he liked me. But when it came to the woman he loved, his business brains just went flyin\' out the window.      [on The Fighting Kentuckian (1949)] Yates [Republic Pictures studio chief Herbert J. Yates] made me use Vera Hruba [Republic star Vera Ralston, who was also Yates\' mistress] . . . I\'ve always been mad at Yates about this, because we lost the chance to have one damn fine movie.      I know what the critics think--that I can\'t act. What is a great actor anyway? Of course, you could say a great actor is one who can play many different parts, like [Laurence Olivier] can. But all the parts I play are tailor-made for me.      [on reactions to The Green Berets (1968)] The left-wingers are shredding my flesh, but like Liberace, we\'re bawling all the way to the bank.      [about the death of James Stewart\'s son, who was killed in Vietnam] Jesus, that was a terrible thing about Gloria and Jimmy Stewart\'s kid getting killed over there. It makes you want to cry. At least Jimmy was over there to see the kid a few months ago. That\'s something. But it makes you want to cry. And [Robert Taylor]\'s going was terrible. He was terminal since they opened him up. I know what he went through. They ripped a lung out of me. I thank God I\'m still here. All the real motion picture people have always made family pictures. But the downbeats and the so-called intelligentsia got in when the government stupidly split up the production companies and the theaters. The old giants--[Louis B. Mayer], [Irving Thalberg], even Harry Cohn, despite the fact that personally I couldn\'t stand him--were good for this industry. Now the goddamned stock manipulators have taken over. They don\'t know a goddamned thing about making movies. They make something dirty, and it makes money, and they say, ""Jesus, let\'s make one a little dirtier, maybe it\'ll make more money"". And now even the bankers are getting their noses into it. I\'ll give you an example. Take that girl, Julie Andrews, a refreshing, openhearted girl, a wonderful performer. Her stint was Mary Poppins (1964) and The Sound of Music (1965). But she wanted to be a Theda Bara. And they went along with her, and the picture fell flat on its ass. A [Samuel Goldwyn] would have told her, ""Look, my dear, you can\'t change your sweet and lovely image"".      But you know, I\'m very conscious that people criticize Hollywood. Yet we\'ve created a form, the Western, that can be understood in every country. The good guys against the bad guys. No nuances. And the horse is the best vehicle of action in our medium. You take action, a scene, and scenery, and cut them together, and you never miss. Action, scene, scenery. But when you think about the Western--ones I\'ve made, for example. Stagecoach (1939), Red River (1948), The Searchers (1956), a picture named Hondo (1953) that had a little depth to it--it\'s an American art form. It represents what this country is about. In True Grit (1969), for example, that scene where Rooster shoots the rat. That was a kind of reference to today\'s problems. Oh, not that ""True Grit"" has a message or anything. But that scene was about less accommodation, and more justice. They keep bringing up the fact that America\'s for the downtrodden. But this new thing of genuflecting to the downtrodden, I don\'t go along with that. We ought to go back to praising the kids who get good grades, instead of making excuses for the ones who shoot the neighborhood grocery man. But, hell, I don\'t want to get started on that!      But back to True Grit (1969). Henry Hathaway used the backgrounds in such a way that it became almost a fantasy. Remember that one scene, where old Rooster is facing those four men across the meadow, and he takes the reins in his teeth and charges? Fill your hands, you varmints! That\'s Henry at work. It\'s a real meadow, but it looks almost dreamlike. Henry made it a fantasy and yet he kept it an honest Western. You get something of that in the character of Rooster. Well, they say he\'s not like what I\'ve done before, and I even say that, but he does have facets of the John Wayne character, huh? I think he does. Of course, they give me that John Wayne stuff so much, claim I always play the same role. Seems like nobody remembers how different the fellas were in The Quiet Man (1952). Or Sands of Iwo Jima (1949). Or She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), where I was 35 playing a man of 65. To stay a star, you have to bring along some of your own personality. Thousands of good actors can carry a scene, but a star has to carry the scene and still, without intruding, allow some of his character into it.      [on True Grit (1969)] And that ending. I liked that. You know, in the book Mattie loses her hand from the snakebite, and I die, and the last scene in the book has her looking at my grave. But the way Marguerite Roberts wrote the screenplay, she gave it an uplift. Mattie and Rooster both go to visit her family plot, after she gets cured of the snakebite. By now it\'s winter. And she offers to let Rooster be buried there some day, seeing as how he has no family of his own. Rooster\'s happy to accept, long as he doesn\'t have to take her up on it too quick. So then he gets on his horse and says, ""Come and see a fat old man sometime"". And then he spurs the horse and jumps a fence, just to show he still can.      [in 1973] Hell yes, I\'m a liberal. I listen to both sides before I make up my mind. Doesn\'t that make you a liberal? Not in today\'s terms, it doesn\'t. These days, you have to be a fucking left-wing radical to be a liberal. Politically, though . . . I\'ve mellowed.      I\'m glad I won\'t be around much longer to see what they do with it. The men who control the big studios today are stock manipulators and bankers. They know nothing about our business. They\'re in it for the buck. The only thing they can do is say, ""Jeez, that picture with what\'s-her-name running around the park naked made money, so let\'s make another one. If that\'s what they want, let\'s give it to them."" Some of these guys remind me of high-class whores. Look at 20th Century-Fox, where they\'re making movies like Myra Breckinridge (1970). Why doesn\'t that son of a bitch Darryl F. Zanuck get himself a striped silk shirt and learn how to play the piano? Then he could work in any room in the house. As much as I couldn\'t stand some of the old-time moguls - especially Harry Cohn - these men took an interest in the future of their business. They had integrity. There was a stretch when they realized that they\'d made a hero out of the goddamn gangster heavy in crime movies, that they were doing a discredit to our country. So the moguls voluntarily took it upon themselves to stop making gangster pictures. No censorship from the outside. They were responsible to the public. But today\'s executives don\'t give a damn. In their efforts to grab the box office that these sex pictures are attracting, they\'re producing garbage. They\'re taking advantage of the fact that nobody wants to be called a bluenose. But they\'re going to reach the point where the American people will say, ""The hell with this!"" And once they do, we\'ll have censorship in every state, in every city, and there\'ll be no way you can make even a worthwhile picture for adults and have it acceptable for national release.      Every time they rate a picture, they let a little more go. Ratings are ridiculous to begin with. There was no need for rated pictures when the major studios were in control. Movies were once made for the whole family. Now, with the kind of junk the studios are cranking out-and the jacked-up prices they\'re charging for the privilege of seeing it - the average family is staying home and watching television. I\'m quite sure that within two or three years, Americans will be completely fed up with these perverted films.      But don\'t get me wrong. As far as a man and a woman is concerned, I\'m awfully happy there\'s a thing called sex. It\'s an extra something God gave us. I see no reason why it shouldn\'t be in pictures. Healthy, lusty sex is wonderful.      When you get hairy, sweaty bodies in the foreground, it becomes distasteful, unless you use a pretty heavy gauze. I can remember seeing pictures that Ernst Lubitsch made in the \'30s that were beautifully risqué--and you\'d certainly send your children to see them. They were done with intimation. They got over everything these other pictures do without showing the hair and the sweat. When you think of the wonderful picture fare we\'ve had through the years and realize we\'ve come to this shit, it\'s disgusting. If they want to continue making those pictures, fine. But my career will have ended. I\'ve already reached a pretty good height right now in a business that I feel is going to fade out from its own vulgarity.      Perhaps we have run out of imagination on how to effect illusion because of the satiating realism of a real war on television. But haven\'t we got enough of that in real life? Why can\'t the same point be made just as effectively in a drama without all the gore? The violence in my pictures, for example, is lusty and a little bit humorous, because I believe humor nullifies violence. Like in one picture, directed by Henry Hathaway [The Sons of Katie Elder (1965)], this heavy was sticking a guy\'s head in a barrel of water. I\'m watching this and I don\'t like it one bit, so I pick up this pick handle and I yell, ""Hey!"" and clock him across the head. Down he went--with no spurting blood. Well, that got a hell of a laugh because of the way I did it. That\'s my kind of violence.      [on True Grit (1969)] In my other pictures, we\'ve had an explosion or something go off when a bad word was said. This time we didn\'t. It\'s profanity, all right, but I doubt if there\'s anybody in the United States who hasn\'t heard the expression ""son of a bitch"" or ""bastard"". We felt it was acceptable in this instance. At the emotional high point in that particular picture, I felt it was OK to use it. It would have been pretty hard to say ""you illegitimate sons of so-and-so!"".      Rooster Cogburn\'s attitude toward life was maybe a little different, but he was basically the same character I\'ve always played.      They made me a singing cowboy. The fact that I couldn\'t sing--or play the guitar--became terribly embarrassing to me, especially on personal appearances. Every time I made a public appearance, the kids insisted that I sing ""The Desert Song"" or something. But I couldn\'t take along the fella who played the guitar out on one side of the camera and the fella who sang on the other side of the camera. So finally I went to the head of the studio and said. ""Screw this, I can\'t handle it."" And I quit doing those kind of pictures. They went out and brought the best hillbilly recording artist in the country to Hollywood to take my place. For the first couple of pictures, they had a hard time selling him, but he finally caught on. His name was Gene Autry. It was 1939 before I made Stagecoach (1939)--the picture that really made me a star.Rio Lobo (1970) certainly wasn\'t any different from most of my Westerns. Nor was Chisum (1970), the one before that. But there still seems to be a very hearty public appetite for this kind of film--what some writers call a typical John Wayne Western. That\'s a label they use disparagingly . . . If I depended on the critics\' judgment and recognition, I\'d never have gone into the motion-picture business.      Sure it did--even if it took the industry 40 years to get around to it [awarding him an Oscar]. But I think both of my two previous Oscar nominations--for She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and Sands of Iwo Jima (1949)--were worthy of the honor. I know the Marines and all the American armed forces were quite proud of my portrayal of Stryker, the Marine sergeant in ""Iwo"". At an American Legion convention in Florida, General Douglas MacArthur told me, ""You represent the American serviceman better than the American serviceman himself."" And, at 42, in ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" I played the same character that I played in True Grit (1969) at 62. But I really didn\'t need an Oscar. I\'m a box-office champion with a record they\'re going to have to run to catch. And they won\'t.      Let\'s say I hope that I appeal to the more carefree times in a person\'s life rather than to his reasoning adulthood. I\'d just like to be an image that reminds someone of joy rather than of the problems of the world.      Luckily so far, it seems they kind of consider me an older friend, somebody believable and down-to-earth. I\'ve avoided being mean or petty, but I\'ve never avoided being rough or tough. I\'ve only played one cautious part in my life, in Allegheny Uprising (1939). My parts have ranged from that rather dull character to Ralls in Wake of the Red Witch (1948), who was a nice enough fella sober, but bestial when he was drunk, and certainly a rebel. I was also a rebel in Reap the Wild Wind (1942) with Cecil B. DeMille. I\'ve played many parts in which I\'ve rebelled against something in society. I was never much of a joiner. Kids do join things, but they also like to consider themselves individuals capable of thinking for themselves. So do I.      Entertainers like Steve Allen and his cronies who went up to Northern California and held placards to save the life of that guy Caryl Chessman. I just don\'t understand these things. I can\'t understand why our national leadership isn\'t willing to take the responsibility of leadership instead of checking polls and listening to the few that scream. Why are we allowing ourselves to become a mobocracy instead of a democracy? When you allow unlawful acts to go unpunished, you\'re moving toward a government of men rather than a government of law; you\'re moving toward anarchy. And that\'s exactly what we\'re doing. We allow dirty loudmouths to publicly call policemen pigs; we let a fella like William Kunstler make a speech to the Black Panthers saying that the ghetto is theirs, and that if police come into it, they have a right to shoot them. Why is that dirty, no-good son of a bitch allowed to practice law?      Quite obviously, the Black Panthers represent a danger to society. They\'re a violent group of young men and women - adventurous, opinionated and dedicated - and they throw their disdain in our face. Now, I hear some of these liberals saying they\'d like to be held as white hostages in the Black Panther offices and stay there so that they could see what happens on these early-morning police raids. It might be a better idea for these good citizens to go with the police on a raid. When they search a Panther hideout for firearms, let these do-gooders knock and say, ""Open the door in the name of the law"" and get shot at.      They\'re standing up for what they feel is right, not for what they think is right--\'cause they don\'t think. As a kid, the Panther ideas probably would have intrigued me. When I was a little kid, you could be adventurous like that without hurting anybody. There were periods when you could blow the valve and let off some steam. Like Halloween. You\'d talk about it for three months ahead of time, and then that night you\'d go out and stick the hose in the lawn, turn it on and start singing ""Old Black Joe"" or something. And when people came out from their Halloween party, you\'d lift the hose and wet them down. And while you were running, the other kids would be stealing the ice cream from the party. All kinds of rebellious actions like that were accepted for that one day. Then you could talk about it for three months afterward. That took care of about six months of the year. There was another day called the Fourth of July, when you could go out and shoot firecrackers and burn down two or three buildings. So there were two days a year. Now those days are gone. You can\'t have firecrackers, you can\'t have explosives, you can\'t have this, don\'t do this, don\'t do that. Don\'t . . . don\'t . . . don\'t. A continual ""don\'t"" until the kids are ready to do almost anything rebellious. The government makes the rules, so now the running of our government is the thing they\'re rebelling against. For a lot of those kids, that\'s just being adventurous. They\'re not deliberately setting out to undermine the foundations of our great country. They\'re doing their level worst--without knowing it. How \'bout all the kids that were at the Chicago Democratic Convention? They were conned into doing hysterical things by a bunch of activists. A lot of Communist-activated people. I know Communism\'s a horrible word to some people. They laugh and say, ""He\'ll be finding them under his bed tomorrow."" But perhaps that\'s because their kid hasn\'t been inculcated yet. Dr. Herbert Marcuse, the political philosopher at the University of California at San Diego, who is quite obviously a Marxist, put it very succinctly when he said, ""We will use the anarchists.""      [Herbert Marcuse] has become a hero only for an articulate clique. The men that give me faith in my country are fellas like Spiro Agnew, not the Marcuses. They\'ve attempted in every way to humiliate Agnew. They\'ve tried the old Rooseveltian thing of trying to laugh him out of political value of his party. Every comedian\'s taken a crack at him. But I bet if you took a poll today, he\'d probably be one of the most popular men in the United States. Nobody likes Spiro Agnew but the people. Yet he and other responsible government leaders are booed and pelted when they speak on college campuses.      Well, when I went to USC, if anybody had gone into the president\'s office and shit in his wastepaper basket and used the dirt to write vulgar words on the wall, not only the football team but the average kid on campus would have gone to work on the guy. There doesn\'t seem to be respect for authority anymore; these student dissenters act like children who have to have their own way on everything. They\'re immature and living in a little world all their own. Just like hippie dropouts, they\'re afraid to face the real competitive world.      I figure if we\'re going to send even one man to die, we ought to be in an all-out conflict. If you fight, you fight to win. And the domino theory is something to be reckoned with, too, both in Europe and in Asia. Look at what happened in Czechoslovakia and what\'s happened all through the Balkans. At some point we have to stop communism. So we might as well stop it right now in Vietnam.      Many of us were being invited to supposed social functions or house parties--usually at well-known Hollywood writers\' homes--that turned out to be Communist recruitment meetings. Suddenly, everybody from makeup men to stagehands found themselves in seminars on Marxism. Take this colonel I knew, the last man to leave the Philippines on a submarine in 1942. He came back here and went to work sending food and gifts to U.S. prisoners on Bataan. He\'d already gotten a Dutch ship that was going to take all this stuff over. The State Department pulled him off of it and sent the poor bastard out to be the technical director on my picture Back to Bataan (1945), which was being made by Edward Dmytryk. I knew that he and a whole group of actors in the picture were pro-Reds, and when I wasn\'t there, these pro-Reds went to work on the colonel. He was a Catholic, so they kidded him about his religion: They even sang ""The Internationale"" at lunchtime. He finally came to me and said, ""Mr. Wayne, I haven\'t anybody to turn to. These people are doing everything in their power to belittle me."" So I went to Dmytryk and said, ""Hey, are you a Commie?"" He said, ""No, I\'m not a Commie. My father was a Russian. I was born in Canada. But if the masses of the American people want communism, I think it\'d be good for our country."" When he used the word ""masses,"" he exposed himself. That word is not a part of Western terminology. So I knew he was a Commie. Well, it later came out that he was. I also knew two other fellas who really did things that were detrimental to our way of life. One of them was Carl Foreman, the guy who wrote the screenplay for High Noon (1952), and the other was Robert Rossen, the one who made the picture about Huey Long, All the King\'s Men (1949). In Rossen\'s version of ""All the King\'s Men"", which he sent me to read for a part, every character who had any responsibility at all was guilty of some offense against society. To make Huey Long a wonderful, rough pirate was great; but, according to this picture, everybody was a shit except for this weakling intern doctor who was trying to find a place in the world. I sent the script back to Charles Feldman, my agent, and said, ""If you ever send me a script like this again, I\'ll fire you."" Ironically, it won the Academy Award. ""High Noon"" was even worse. Everybody says ""High Noon"" is a great picture because Dimitri Tiomkin wrote some great music for it and because Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly were in it. So it\'s got everything going for it. In that picture, four guys come in to gun down the sheriff. He goes to the church and asks for help and the guys go, ""Oh well, oh gee."" And the women stand up and say, ""You\'re rats. You\'re rats. You\'re rats."" So Cooper goes out alone. It\'s the most un-American thing I\'ve ever seen in my whole life. The last thing in the picture is ole Coop putting the United States marshal\'s badge under his foot and stepping on it. I\'ll never regret having helped run Foreman out of this country. Running him out of the country is just a figure of speech. But I did tell him that I thought he\'d hurt Gary Cooper\'s reputation a great deal. Foreman said, ""Well, what if I went to England?"" I said, ""Well, that\'s your business."" He said, ""Well, that\'s where I\'m going."" And he did.      I\'ve always followed my father\'s advice: He told me, first, to always keep my word and, second, to never insult anybody unintentionally. If I insult you, you can be goddamn sure I intend to. And, third, he told me not to go around looking for trouble. Well, I guess I have had some problems sticking to that third rule, but I\'d say I\'ve done pretty damn well with the first and second. I try to have good enough taste to insult only those I wish to insult. I\'ve worked in a business where it\'s almost a requirement to break your word if you want to survive, but whenever I signed a contract for five years or for a certain amount of money, I\'ve always lived up to it. I figured that if I was silly enough to sign it, or if I thought it was worth while at the time, that\'s the way she goes. I\'m not saying that I won\'t drive as hard a bargain as I can. In fact, I think more about that end of the business than I did before, ever since 1959, when I found that my business manager was playing more than he was working. I didn\'t know how bad my financial condition was until my lawyer and everybody else said, ""Let\'s all have a meeting and figure out exactly where you stand."" At the conclusion of that meeting, it was quite obvious that I wasn\'t in anywhere near the shape that I thought I was or ought to be after twenty-five years of hard work. If they\'d given me the time to sell everything without taking a quick loss, I would have come out about even. Oil and everything else. Not enough constructive thinking had been done. Then there was the shrimp fiasco. One of my dearest friends was Robert Arias, who was married to the ballerina Dame Margot Fonteyn. While his brother Tony was alive, we had control of about seventy per cent of the shrimp in Panama. We were also buying some island property near the Panama Canal. We were going to put in a ship-repair place. There were tugs standing down there at $150 a day to drag ships back up to the United States, because repair prices in the Canal Zone were so high. But our plans fell through when Tony was killed in an airplane accident. Around a half a million dollars was lost. If anything happened to me now, I have the right amount of insurance. I hope and pray, for my estate. I\'m about as big a rancher as there is in Arizona, so I have outside interests other than my motion-picture work. The turning point was the moment I decided to watch what was being done with my money.      I had two operations six days apart - one for a cancer that was as big as a baby\'s fist, and then one for edema. I wasn\'t so uptight when I was told about the cancer. My biggest fear came when they twisted my windpipe and had to sew me back together a second time. When my family came in to see me and I saw the looks on their faces, I figured, ""Well, Jeez, I must be just about all through. I kept my spirits up by thinking about God and my family and my friends and telling myself, ""Everything will be all right."" And it was. I licked the Big C. I know the man upstairs will pull the plug when he wants to, but I don\'t want to end up my life being sick. I want to go out on two feet - in action. The operation hasn\'t impeded anything except that I get short of breath quickly. Particularly in the higher altitudes, that slows me down. I still do my own fights and all that stuff. I\'d probably do a little bit more if I had more wind, but I still do more than my share. Nobody else does anything any more than I do, whether they\'re young or old.      I don\'t have to assert my virility. I think my career has shown that I\'m not exactly a pantywaist. But I do take pride in my work, even to the point of being the first one on the set in the morning. I\'m a professional.      What the hell, in my racket I\'ve fallen off a lot of horses. I even fell off on purpose in True Grit (1969). But that fall in The Undefeated (1969) was irritating because I tore some ligaments in my shoulder. I don\'t have good use of one arm anymore, and it makes me look like an idiot when I\'m getting on a horse.      There\'s been no top authority saying what marijuana does to you. I really don\'t know that much about it. I tried it once, but it didn\'t do anything to me. The kids say it makes them think they\'re going thirty miles an hour when they\'re going eighty. If that\'s true, marijuana use should definitely be stopped. When I went to Hong Kong, I tried opium once, as a clinical thing. I heard it didn\'t make you sick the first time, and Jesus, it just didn\'t affect me one way or the other, either. So I\'m not a very good judge of how debasing it is.      Well, at one time in my career, I guess sexuality was part of my appeal. But God, I\'m 63 years old now. How the hell do I know whether I still convey that? Jeez. It\'s pretty hard to answer a question like, ""Are you attractive to broads?"" All that crap comes from the way I walk, I guess. There\'s evidently a virility in it. Otherwise, why do they keep mentioning it? But I\'m certainly not conscious of any particular walk. I guess I must walk different than other people, but I haven\'t gone to any school to learn how.      If a guy wants to wear his hair down to his ass, I\'m not revolted by it. But I don\'t look at him and say, ""Now there\'s a fella I\'d like to spend next winter with.""Winston Churchill\'s the most terrific fella of our century. If I had to make a speech on the subject of Communism, I could think of nobody that had a better insight or that said things concerning the future that have proven out so well. Let me read to you from a book of his quotes. While [Franklin D. Roosevelt] was giving the world Communism, Churchill said, ""I tell you--it\'s no use arguing with a Communist. It\'s no good trying to convert a Communist, or persuade him. You can only deal with them on the following basis . . . you can only do it by having superior force on your side on the matter in question--and they must also be convinced that you will use--you will not hesitate to use these forces if necessary, in the most ruthless manner. You have not only to convince the Soviet government that you have superior force--but that you are not restrained by any moral consideration if the case arose from using that force with complete material ruthlessness. And that is the greatest chance of peace, the surest road to peace. Churchill was unparalleled. Above all, he took a nearly beaten nation and kept their dignity for them.      If I had it to do over again, I\'d probably do everything I did. But that\'s not necessarily the right thing to do.      You\'re going to think I\'m being corny, but this is how I really feel: I hope my family and my friends will be able to say that I was an honest, kind and fairly decent man.      [About his close friend Maureen O\'Hara] There\'s only one woman who has been my friend over the years and by that I mean a real friend, like a man would be. That woman is Maureen O\'Hara. She\'s big, lusty, and absolutely marvelous, definitely my kind of woman. She\'s a great guy. I\'ve had many friends and I prefer the company of men. Except for Maureen O\'Hara.      [on Maureen O\'Hara] She is a woman who speaks her mind and that impressed me, despite my old-fashioned chauvinistic ways! She is feminine and beautiful, but there is something about her that makes her more like a man. It\'s her stubbornness and her willingness to stand up to anyone--even John Ford.      [April 1944, on Victory Committee USO tour] What go me was the way those kids out there kept their sense of humor. Through hard work, battle, or deadly monotony, they could laugh. Healthy beefing, sure, but no squawks. Taking it, day after day, and no complaining. It got me.      [1/46, interview in ""Screenland"" magazine] The picture business has grown up since I got into it 15 years ago, has acquired a dignity that is beyond reproach. Hollywood is, today, a quiet town compared to other places I have been and can, moreover, be pretty proud of itself, having pushed more charities, given more time to selling war bonds and more talent to entertaining servicemen than any other town in any other part of the country.      In B-pictures all we ever did is tell a story. He\'s gone to Red Gap! Where\'s Red Gap? There\'s Red Gap! Let\'s git after him to Red Gap. Here\'s Red Gap! But in A-pictures you reacted more to the situations.      You may think all my parts are the same. That\'s just what I want you to think. You get lost on the screen if your personality doesn\'t show through.      Couches are for one thing only.      Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. It comes into us at midnight very clean. It\'s perfect when it arrives and puts itself in our hands. It hopes we\'ve learned something from yesterday.      [in 1971] I licked the Big C. I know the man upstairs will pull the plug when he wants to, but I don\'t want to end my life being sick. I want to go out on two feet--in action.      [in 1971] Republic Pictures gave me a screen credit on one of the early pictures and called me Michael Burns. On another one they called me Duke Morrison. Then they decided Duke Morrison didn\'t have enough prestige. My real name, Marion Michael Morrison, didn\'t sound American enough for them. So they came up with John Wayne. I didn\'t have any say in it, but I think it\'s a great name. It\'s short and strong and to the point. It took me a long time to get used to it, though. I still don\'t recognize it when somebody calls me John . . .      [At his divorce trial in 1953] I deeply regret I\'m going to have to sling mud.      (On Howard Hawks) ""Oh, yeah, Hawks and I had a few fights along the way,"" Wayne said, ""but he accepted me as an expert, which I was, and we did not have any more trouble, and I was always happy to work for Hawks.""      The guy you see on the screen really isn\'t me. I\'m Duke Morrison and I never was and never will be a film personality like John Wayne. I know him well. I\'m one of his closest students. I have to be. I make a living out of him.Salary (50)Bardelys the Magnificent\xa0(1926)      $10 /day      The Big Trail\xa0(1930)      $75 /week      Three Girls Lost\xa0(1931)      $200 /week      The Deceiver\xa0(1931)      $350 /week      The Range Feud\xa0(1931)      $350 /week      Maker of Men\xa0(1931)      $350 /week      The Voice of Hollywood No. 13 (Second Series)\xa0(1932)      $200       The Shadow of the Eagle\xa0(1932)      $675       Texas Cyclone\xa0(1932)      $350 /week      Two-Fisted Law\xa0(1932)      $350 /week      The Hurricane Express\xa0(1932)      $675       Ride Him, Cowboy\xa0(1932)      $1,500       The Big Stampede\xa0(1932)      $1,500       Haunted Gold\xa0(1932)      $1,500       The Telegraph Trail\xa0(1933)      $1,500       The Three Musketeers\xa0(1933)      $500       Somewhere in Sonora\xa0(1933)      $1,500       The Life of Jimmy Dolan\xa0(1933)      $1,500       His Private Secretary\xa0(1933)      $150 per week      Baby Face\xa0(1933)      $1,500       The Man from Monterey\xa0(1933)      $1,500       Westward Ho\xa0(1935)      $6,000       Sea Spoilers\xa0(1936)      $6,000       California Straight Ahead!\xa0(1937)      $6,000       I Cover the War!\xa0(1937)      $6,000       Idol of the Crowds\xa0(1937)      $6,000       Adventure\'s End\xa0(1937)      $6,000       Stagecoach\xa0(1939)      $3,700       Reap the Wild Wind\xa0(1942)      $25,000       Without Reservations\xa0(1946)      $68,000       Fort Apache\xa0(1948)      $110,000       Red River\xa0(1948)      $75,000 + percentage of gross      Wake of the Red Witch\xa0(1948)      $75,000 + 10% of gross      Sands of Iwo Jima\xa0(1949)      $180,000 + 10% of gross      Flying Leathernecks\xa0(1951)      $300,000       The Barbarian and the Geisha\xa0(1958)      $700,000       Rio Bravo\xa0(1959)      $750,000       The Horse Soldiers\xa0(1959)      $750,000       The Horse Soldiers\xa0(1959)      $500,000       The Horse Soldiers\xa0(1959)      $750,000 + 20% of the gross      North to Alaska\xa0(1960)      $750,000 + 10% of gross      The Comancheros\xa0(1961)      $750,000 + 10% of gross      The Longest Day\xa0(1962)      $250,000       The Greatest Story Ever Told\xa0(1965)      $250,000       The War Wagon\xa0(1967)      $1,000,000 + % of gross      The Green Berets\xa0(1968)      $1,000,000       Hellfighters\xa0(1968)      $1,000,000       Rio Lobo\xa0(1970)      $1,000,000       Brannigan\xa0(1975)      $500,000       The Shootist\xa0(1976)      $750,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nJoanne Dru ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 21 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(5)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(4)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(9)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(2)  Overview (5)Date of Birth31\xa0January1922,\xa0Logan, West Virginia, USA Date of Death10\xa0September1996,\xa0Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California, USA      \xa0(lymphedema)    Birth NameJoanne Letitia LaCockNicknameJoanne Marshall    Height5\'\xa05½""\xa0(1.66\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          The daughter of a West Virginia druggist, Joanne Dru came to New York in 1940. In New York she worked as a model and was cast by Al Jolson as one of the showgirls in his Broadway play ""Hold Onto Your Hats."" When the show closed in 1941, she married popular singer Dick Haymes and went with him to Hollywood. Discovered by a talent scout while working in the theater, Joanne made her screen debut in Abie\'s Irish Rose (1946), and that picture almost ended her career. Two years later she ""redeemed"" herself with her role in the classic Howard Hawks western Red River (1948). She followed that with another western, John Ford\'s She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), again playing opposite John Wayne. Unfortunately, her success in those two classics resulted in the scripts being submitted to her consisting of mostly westerns, and she got typecast (this from a woman who said, ""I simply hated horses..."").In 1950 she was cast in another John Ford western, Wagon Master (1950), which became the basis for the Ward Bond TV series Wagon Train (1957). Even though she played in films other than westerns--All the King\'s Men (1949), The Pride of St. Louis (1952) and Hell on Frisco Bay (1955), for example--it was the westerns for which she was remembered. By the late 1950s westerns were running out of steam and so was her screen career, so she turned to TV, where she appeared on shows such as Playhouse 90 (1956).In 1960 Joanne was cast in the role of the Eastern owner of a dude ranch in the comedy series Guestward Ho! (1960). Perhaps even funnier is that she would play an Easterner after all those westerns is the fact that her character name was Babs. The show ended in 1961.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Tony Fontana <tony.fontana@spacebbs.com>          Spouse (4) C.V.

The claim that he had done a ""pink film"" in Denmark was a gag. He starred in Journey to the Seventh Planet (1962), which was shot in Denmark, by writer/producer/director Sidney W. Pink.      Interviewed in Tom Weaver\'s books ""Interviews with B Science Fiction and Horror Movie Makers"" (McFarland & Co., 1988) and ""They Fought in the Creature Features"" (McFarland & Co., 1995).

After Universal put Agar into a third horror film, The Mole People (1956), he became disillusioned with the studio, especially since he had to compete with Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson, George Nader and Jeff Chandler for choice leading man roles, and he left the studio.Personal Quotes (12)      I don\'t resent being identified with B science fiction movies at all. Why should I? Even though they were not considered top of the line, for those people that like sci-fi, I guess they were fun. My whole feeling about working as an actor is, if I give anybody any enjoyment, I\'m doing my job, and that\'s what counts.      To me it\'s much easier to play in something that\'s real -- a natural situation -- than it is to deal with abstracts and the unknown. It\'s sort of difficult to make them come to life! I always had the feeling that when people looked at some of these science fiction things we were going to get a big laugh. On a couple of occasions some of the things that were supposed to frighten people really looked rather ludicrous -- funny, rather than scary. I feel it\'s more natural to deal in something that people understand, rather than something that human beings don\'t come in contact with.      [in a 1991 interview] Acting is something that I love to do, but it\'s a part of me that\'s often dormant. So, when I get an opportunity to go on a film set it\'s like somebody\'s pushing a button that has been idle for a long time and right away I\'m ready to get going at it. It\'s fun for me to be able to get back into it because it\'s a part of my life that I\'ve really enjoyed.      To me the idea of just working is what\'s fun, I don\'t give a doggone what kind of part. Walter Huston said it years ago: ""I don\'t care about billing. If the show is good and I\'m good in it, people are going to say, \'Who was that?\' And if it\'s not, I don\'t want \'em to know I was in it!""      Who wants to shake the hand of the first man to put it to America\'s sweetheart?      [about Daughter of Dr. Jekyll (1957)] I did that picture strictly for the bread. I didn\'t fluff it--but it wasn\'t my cup of tea. I just didn\'t believe it.      [about director Jack Arnold] I\'ve always had nothing but great respect for Jack Arnold. I did Revenge of the Creature (1955) for him and then the next year we did Tarantula (1955), and we got along very well. So far as I was concerned, he was a very knowledgeable director and he gave his all trying to make \'em the best that he could.      [on the ""floating brain"" from The Brain from Planet Arous (1957)] I thought it was terrible--just awful! They really could have done a heck of a better than that--it looked like a balloon with a face painted on it. And that\'s probably what it was, too.      [on working with director Edward L.

He decided to stick around (the pay was good), and for some years was a stunt man, horse wrangler, and double for such stars as John Wayne, Gary Cooper and James Stewart. His break came when John Ford noticed him and gave him a part in an upcoming film, and eventually a star part in Wagon Master (1950). He left Hollywood in 1953 to return to rodeo, where he won a world roping championship, but at the end of the year he had barely cleared expenses. The movies paid better, and were less risky, so he returned to the west coast and a career that saw him in over 300 movies.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Bruce Cameron <dumarest@midcoast.com>          Spouse (1)               Carol Elaine Jones          (31 August\xa01941            - 27 March\xa01994)\xa0(her death)          Trade Mark (3)        Plain-spoken, Southern characters        His great athletic ability with horses        Tall, chesty frameTrivia (17)      Died of a heart attack while visiting his mother in the retirement community where, not only she, but he himself lived.      A prize belt buckle that he won for calf roping was stolen from his car when he visited Houston in 1976; on a repeat visit a decade later, he was an on-air guest on radio station KIKK when a caller returned the buckle to him.      Johnson and his father, Ben Johnson, Sr., were champion steer ropers. The senior Johnson was also a cattleman and rancher who was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 1961. The younger Johnson was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 1982.      His father, Ben Johnson, Sr., was inducted into the Rodeo Hall of Fame of the Rodeo Historical Society (a support group of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum) in 1961. The Ben Johnson Memorial Award, in honor of his father, is awarded annually to prominent representatives of the western character and spirit (since 1998).      Johnson, his father, and nephew have Belt-Buckle awards for team roping.      Had Cherokee and Irish blood.      Had initially turned down the role of Sam the Lion in The Last Picture Show (1971) when it was first offered to him by Peter Bogdanovich because he thought the script was ""dirty"", and he did not approve of swearing and nudity in motion pictures. Bogdanovich appealed to John Ford, who got Johnson to change his mind as a favor to him. With the permission of Bogdanovich, Johnson rewrote his role with the offensive words removed. Johnson went on to win a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for playing the role.      Johnson got his first big break as a member of John Ford\'s stock company in the late 1940s. However, during the making of Rio Grande (1949), Johnson and Ford had a brief verbal argument. All seemed well afterward, and nothing further was said of it, so Ben assumed it was completely blown over. However, Ford didn\'t use Johnson again in another picture for 14 years, when Ben played a small role in Cheyenne Autumn (1964). Johnson\'s lifelong friend Harry Carey Jr. said he believed the reason was that when Ford was casting The Sun Shines Bright (1953), Johnson\'s agent heard that Ford wanted him for the role, called Ford--without Johnson\'s knowledge--and demanded a hefty salary. Outraged at having been squeezed like that, Ford held it against Johnson, and used that and the argument they had during ""Rio Grande"" as an excuse not to use him again. They did manage to maintain a friendly relationship nonetheless.

I didn\'t know any more than I did before I won it, but they thought I did.      When I left Oklahoma, I wasn\'t even sure which direction Hollywood was, but I could ride a horse pretty good. I had no formal education to speak of. I was a cowboy from the time I hit the ground. I knew if a cow weighed 1,000 pounds and bought $10 a hundred, I knew how much that was. But I was fortunate because people accepted my character. I ran my life a certain way. I didn\'t hobnob with the elites because I didn\'t do drugs and I didn\'t drink a lot of whiskey . . . oh, I might take a drink now and then, but you know what I mean.      I can\'t handle phony people, and there are a lot of them in Hollywood. I\'ve built my life around the principles of honesty, realism and respect, and if the people in Hollywood are so pumped up on themselves they can\'t deal with that, I say the hell with \'em.

SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON is, arguably, the most enduring and appealing of
John Ford's 'Cavalry' trilogy. While lacking the dramatic core of a fatally
flawed central character (FORT APACHE), or an estranged couple reunited by a
headstrong son (RIO GRANDE), the film offers a richly sentimental tale of a
crusty yet endearing career soldier (John Wayne)  facing retirement, in a
romanticized West where the cavalry stands as the only defense against the
combined might of the Indian nations. The combination of Wayne and the
cavalry in SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON is simply unbeatable!<br><br>Wayne, at 42, portrays the sixty-ish Capt. Nathan Brittles, and under Ford's
sure hand, is magnificent in the role. Whether chastising young lieutenants
(""Never apologize, mister, it's a sign of weakness""), complimenting an
enlisted man (""Keep it up, and you'll make a fine corporal, in three or four
years""), or kneeling at the grave of his long-dead wife, to share the news
of the day, Wayne's performance shows a subtlety and sensitivity that his
critics often claimed he lacked. When his commander, Major Allshard (George
O'Brien) refuses his request to rescue Lt. Cohill (John Agar) and two squads
who had performed rear guard duty, the anguish Wayne shows is heartbreaking.
This is an Oscar-caliber performance, from a vastly underrated
actor.<br><br>The rest of the cast measures up equally well. Victor McLaglen, as irascible
as ever, plays Irish Top Sergeant Quincannon, full of blarney and (a bit of)
whiskey. His morning scenes with Wayne, denying he'd been drinking, are
comic gems. As the young suitors of Joanne Dru (who plays a more traditional
role than in Howard Hawks' RED RIVER), Agar and Harry Carey Jr. are also
quite good. <br><br>The real 'find' of the film, however, is Ben Johnson, in only his second
major role. As Sgt. Tyree, ex-Confederate captain, and Brittles' best scout,
Johnson shows an easy-going charm, a (feigned) lack of respect (when asked
his opinion, he'd always begin with ""That's not my department..."" then make
a dead-on assessment), and astonishing riding skills (not surprising, as
Johnson had been a champion rodeo rider). A future Oscar winner, he displays
a charisma on-camera that would quickly earn him a place in the 'Ford
Family' of actors. <br><br>The visuals of SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON have been frequently compared to
Fredric Remington's classic paintings of cavalrymen and Indians, and the
comparison is justified; the film would win an Oscar for it's rich
Technicolor photography, and images of 'dirty blue' riders on horseback
against the stark blue sky and golden hues of Monument Valley are very
reminiscent of the artist's work.<br><br>SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON is the kind of film you can watch again and again,
and still find rewarding. It is on my 'short list' of favorite westerns, and
if you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a treat!

There is an ironic point about the production of SHE WORE A YELLOW
RIBBON immediately after FORT APACHE. Most critics agree that Col. Owen
Thursday, the martinet commander, is based on General George Armstrong
Custer, and that the massacre of his command due to his own pig
headedness is the battle of the Little Bighorn. But SHE WORE A YELLOW
RIBBON begins with that moment in the summer of 1876 when the entire
frontier was nervous after word came of the destruction of Custer
forces. The historic continuity (which is amazingly consistent, despite
minor anachronisms) is shown early when Captain Brittles, visiting his
wife's grave, mentions to her the death of Captain Miles Keogh at the
Little Bighorn. Historically this is correct. Keogh, a hero of the
American Civil War, served with Custer's Seventh Cavalry and died with
his commander and fellows. In fact, the only ""survivor"" of Custer's
forces at that disaster was Keogh's horse, ""Commanche"".<br><br>Captain Brittles has served in the American cavalry for thirty years.
He was one of those soldiers who held higher rank in the Civil War with
a ""Brevet"", but in the cutbacks in the army following the war (Custer
went from brevet major general to Lt. Col. in the regular army)Brittles
had to be satisfied with the rank of Captain. His wife and children
died (presumably of some epidemic illness at the post - they are buried
nearby). His old orderly from the war, Quincannon (Victor McLaglen) is
still serving him. But he is facing a crisis. His thirty years means
retirement, unless the army decides to promote him to Colonel. Despite
the debacle in Montana, it is not too likely that the politically
unconnected Brittles will get the promotion his fine abilities deserve.<br><br>So we are watching an old soldier slowly fade away in this film.
Brittles is aware he has days before he is to leave (unless a promotion
turns up), and he has to try to keep the hot blooded Indian braves,
impressed at what they just saw Crazy Horse and the Lakota forces
accomplish, go on the warpath. He also has to keep his two most
promising young officers (John Agar and Harry Carey Jr.) concentrating
on their careers rather than fighting over Joanne Dru. He is worried
too for Sgt. Quincannon, who is likewise going to be leaving the army a
few days after Brittles. Will Quincannon's drunken, roistering ways
ruin his chances to maintain his pension? And he has to keep an eye on
the suspicious behavior of the local fort sutler (Paul Fix) is up to -
can he be running guns? Whatever he faces, he faces unflinchingly, and
his motto is never to apologize - it's a sign of weakness.<br><br>For all the anachronisms listed on this thread, such as the 48 star
flag (in 1876?), Ford got the time and place perfect in what counts.
Note the fascinating relationship of Brittles and Sgt. Tyree (Ben
Johnson). 1876 was a crossroad year for the U.S. regarding the results
of the Civil War. In the negative, a questionable Presidential election
result was solidified when three southern states agreed to support the
Republican (Rutherford Hayes) over the Democrat (Samuel Tilden) in
return for the Federal troops being pulled out of the south and the
official end of Reconstruction policies benefiting southern
African-Americans. One can't deny that is still a stain in American
history (despite Hayes excellent handling of the Presidency
afterwords). But the former foes were finding less and less reason to
dislike each other, and more and more to admire the grit both sides had
shown. During the Civil War, Tyree was a Confederate Captain - he was
Brittles' equal in rank. Once the war ended, after a few years, he
joins the American Army and rises to the rank of Sergeant. Technically
he is not as high a Sergeant as Quincannon, who is Brittles' aide. But
Brittles constantly treats Tyree as a full equal, consulting him again
and again on how to move next when going out of the fort to confront
the Indian threat. The highpoint of this respect is when one of Tyree's
""soldiers"", ""Trooper Smith"" turns out to be a former Confederate
cavalry leader named Rome Clay, and dies of wounds in an action against
the Indians. Brittles and his men watch silently while Tyree and his
fellow southern soldiers bury Clay properly with his flag, the
Confederate one.<br><br>In terms of relations between the whites of the North and South, SHE
WORE A YELLOW RIBBON is miles away from the confrontations of, say THE
PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND. There John Carridine's northern officer has
nothing but fanatical contempt for Dr. Mudd, whom he considers evil for
helping John Wilkes Booth. Until the end of that film, Carridine takes
a sadistic interest in making Warner Baxter regret his every move. The
events of THE PRISONER was from 1865 - 1869 (when Mudd finally returned
to Maryland). This is seven years afterwords.<br><br>There are other little historical pointers. The rivalry of immigrant
groups is shown when Quincannon is facing rival Sergeant Hochbauer, who
openly dislikes the former as an overbearing Irishman (Hochbauer being
a German). There is the civilian clothes that are meant for Brittles
(complete with ""Muller cut-down hat"") that Quincannon ends sampling
(which leads to his hysterically funny fight with Hochbauer and the
other soldiers meant to take him to the guardhouse). Quincannon insists
he is not out of uniform (technically he is) but is simply dressed as a
retired gentleman should be. Yes, in 1876, that would be the dress of a
retired gentleman.<br><br>I like this film. The characterizations of the all the actors are
strong, and Ford had great set pieces in it. Perhaps not as great a
film as THE SEARCHERS (which is more meaty and dark), but a top notch
Western all the same.

'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon' remains for many viewers their favorite Ford
film, and it is certainly the most striking visually... Winton C. Hoch
won an Oscar for his Technicolor photography... <br><br>The compositions and photography around Ford's new stamping ground of
Monument valley are great to look at as always... The Monument Valley
goes from bright sunlight to hail and sleet...<br><br>There is a melancholy mixed together in those incredible vistas, with a
certain sense of dreamlike contemplation... A backdrop so complex but
so significant as the human characters...<br><br>Ford has superbly achieved a huge and composite demonstration of all
the legends of the frontier cavalryman... Never have the legendary
troops been through the silent 'Indian country' and across the
magnificent Western plains so brilliant, vivid, exciting and
romantic... <br><br>Ford has surely done better himself, unquestionably with 'My Darling
Clementine,' and 'The Searchers,' yet one has to admit the undisputed
merits of 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.' Even the usual criticism launched
against it-that it is a Western influenced by feeling rather by
reasoncan be dismissed at the start... Certainly Ford can be
sentimental but only when the springs of honest feeling run dry and
lose their inspiration, and this never really happens in 'She Wore a
Yellow Ribbon.'<br><br>The story is that of an older cavalry officer (John Wayne) who is six
days from retirement at Fort Stark when he's sent out, in a last
mission, to escort the Major's wife (Mildred Natwick) and her niece, an
attractive single lady (Joanne Dru) out of the danger area... Wayne
tries to fulfill his military role protecting his female charges
against the uprising of the Sioux, Cheyenne, Kiowa, Comanche and
Apaches...<br><br>Wayne possibly more than any other Western star has re-created and
heightened the mythology of the West-one has only to watch again his
absolute and ideal image in 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,' or his avenging
Ethan in 'The Searchers,' to be reminded of how irresistible the Duke
has been on the cinema screen...<br><br>'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon' is above all a sentimental movie, with
irresistible scenes, full of Ford's best touches:<br><br>- The cavalry engaged in its everyday work... Wayne simply can't
picture himself in a world far from the army...<br><br>- The comic interaction between Wayne and Victor McLaglen, two hardcore
professional officers...<br><br>- The bravery of Sgt. Tyree (Ben Johnson), chased by hostile Indians,
who must finish his mission by reporting to the captain what he saw...<br><br>- The rivalry of two young cavalry lieutenants (John Agar and Harry
Carey Jr.) in love with the same woman, each competing to have her wear
a yellow ribbon as a token of his love...<br><br>- The 'beloved brute,' the tough-soft cavalry sergeant sharing his
saddle with a little orphan rescued from a devastated stage station...<br><br>- Ford celebrating McLaglen's lachrymose in self-indulgent fisticuffs
in an epic saloon fight... <br><br>- The last inspection of the C. troops almost bringing tears to Wayne's
and the audience's eyes, as he reads the inscription that means so much
to him... <br><br>- Wayne riding into the war camp of the Indians to stop a war...<br><br>- The U. S. cavalry at full gallop descending upon the encampment,
firing wildly and stampeding hundred of Indian ponies... <br><br>- The evocative use of music, notably the gay and spirited theme song
of the yellow ribbon, played countless times...<br><br>'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon ' is an exciting story with strong characters
and sentiment, highly enjoyable, and beautiful...

The second of John Ford's cavalry trilogy that deals with the life of
the professional soldier is the only one that was photographed in
color. Lucky are we, the cinema fans two generations away.<br><br>She Wore A Yellow Ribbon has John Wayne the embodiment of the thirty
year army man. The year of the action of the film which is 1876 has
Wayne mentioning in passing that he was at the Battle of Chapultepec in
the Mexican War which started in 1846. Wayne's Nathan Brittles was by
his account a dirty shirt tailed runaway from his father's Ohio farm
when he joined the army. And now he's reached mandatory retirement.
He's married and has had a family who he's lost for reasons John Ford
doesn't explain in the film. But Wayne dutifully, ""makes his report"" at
their gravesides every night he's at the post.<br><br>Wayne's seen a lot of military history and a lot of tragedy. With no
family left, the United States Cavalry is his home and family. He
doesn't like the idea of retiring at all. In a later Ford film, The
Long Gray Line, Martin Maher says that all he knows and holds dear is
at West Point. Wayne could have said that line himself here.<br><br>Even though George O'Brien is the commanding officer at Fort Stark,
Wayne is the father figure for the whole post. And not like some of the
others don't behave like children. The whole romantic rivalry between
John Agar and Harry Carey, Jr. over Joanne Dru seems pretty childish.
Cute while in the safety of the post, but when out on a mission
downright dangerous and Wayne like the good father scolds his kiddies.<br><br>With some makeup to grey his hair and wrinkle him a might, Wayne turns
in one of his finest performances on the screen. Harry Carey, Jr. wrote
what is probably the most evenly balanced portrayal of the Duke in his
memoirs In the Company of Heroes. They didn't always get along, but
Carey says Wayne was an inspiration to him and the other younger cast
members. In fact during the scene with the gunrunners Paul Fix and
Grant Withers being killed in the Indian camp while Wayne, Carey, and
Agar watch on the ridge, the whole idea for the chaw of tobacco bit
came from Carey himself, but that Wayne encouraged the improvisation as
he was wont to do. <br><br>Other than the Duke, my favorite portrayal in the film is that of Ben
Johnson as Sergeant Tyree. Wayne recognizes in him a younger version of
himself. In fact Tyree is a former Confederate Army captain, a fact
brought out in the death scene of ""Trooper Smith"" another former
Confederate who in fact was a general in that army. Ben Johnson was a
real cowboy, a horse wrangler who John Ford gave a chance to act. He
graced many a film with his presence and won himself an Oscar to cap
his career in The Last Picture Show.<br><br>Like in Fort Apache and Rio Grande, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is the
story of the professional soldier and the sacrifices he makes when he
gives up his civilian status to serve his country. It's a universal
theme, not just confined to the USA. No one embodied that theme better
than did John Wayne as Nathan Brittles in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.

Anyone who thinks John Wayne can't act should see this movie and eat crow. 
A young man then, he played a cavalry officer on the verge of retirement. 
Watch his eyes (the sign of a great actor).  It's a wonder he wasn't even
nominated for the Academy Award for this role, which few in Hollywood could
pull off convincingly.<br><br>It's also a John Wayne western the woman in your life will probably like. 
Wayne talks tenderly at the grave of his wife, and even has a moment of
sucking back weeping when his men show their fondness for
him.<br><br>This bittersweet, elegaic film about a retiring officer on his last mission
doesn't have lots of action in it (Ford seems to have thrown in a fistfight
with McLaglin just because that actor had little to do, and though it's
corny, it has a wonderful beginning).  <br><br>Apart from Wayne, the reason to watch this is the cinematography.  Monument
valley, host to myriad westerns, never looked better.  They even captured a
marvelous thunderstorm in the background, in these days before special
effects (the cinematographer, who did snatch an Oscar, originally protested
the work, but Ford made him film the scene and they ended up with one of the
most striking natural scenes ever).<br><br>For years people didn't think Wayne could act.  Some, like me, grew up on
his later, post-""True Grit"" movies, when he did tend to walk through his
parts, more icon than actor.  He didn't have great finesse with his lines
(neither does a fine actor of today, Harrison Ford), but his roles rarely
called for the nicety of a Jeremy Irons.  In his better movies, Wayne proves
he's more than just a movie star.  This is his finest hour, and may be John
Ford's.

Like ""My Darling Clementine"", Ford used the name of a song and even more
than in Clementine, he deviated from the pattern of a standard
western. Although the basic structure is a story of war with
Indians,
there is more focus on the people, which are the essence of this great film.
Joanne Dru is the beautiful niece of the commanding officer and she thrives
on her power of seduction. When she wears the yellow ribbon, both John Agar
and Harry Carey Jr hope it is for them.
John Wayne is a captain who is going to retire, he is the one who knows it
all, and his relationship with Ben Johnson, an ex confederate, is a model of
human respect. Victor McLaglen is the strong,loyal Irishman who loves to
fight and drink. There are some incredibly beautiful shots of Monument
Valley in great color.When Joanne Dru at a certain moment feels guilty about
all the trouble she caused and says to Wayne she is sorry, he tells her not
to apologize for it is a sign of weakness, and considering all the
excitement and joy she brought to the cavalry, he is certainly
right.

It seems trite to say they don't make them like this anymore. But it's
a fact. They don't make them like this anymore. And it seems likely we
won't be seeing them making them like this ever again. This is John
Ford at the height of his career, at his best, doing what he did best.
On location in the Monument Valley, it is more than fair to say the
scenery, the colors, even the weather, along with Ford's
cinematography, particularly the patient framing of his shots and
making full use of the setting and environment in which he filmed, are
every bit as much stars of this film as are the featured human stars.<br><br>None of which is to say the human stars weren't good. John Wayne in the
lead turned in a remarkable performance. Wayne was 42-years old when he
made this, but he was playing a character much older than that, perhaps
as much as 20 years older, and Wayne pulls it off. He looks and seems
like a 60-year old man. He showed his acting chops here.<br><br>Ben Johnson had been around awhile at this point, mainly as a stuntman,
but here he makes one of his first forays into real acting, and he does
well, which no doubt boosted his career.<br><br>Perennial John Wayne sidekick Harry Carey, Jr. is here too, at the ripe
young age of 28. It occurs to me as I write this in November 2008 that
he seems to be the last surviving cast member of this movie.<br><br>Joanne Dru. What can be said? While this movie was made before I was
born, Joanne Dru plays the fetching young woman wearing the yellow
ribbon and stirring the male ashes deep inside as well as anybody ever
could, and she was quite fetching indeed. Her performance still
striking that chord precisely that way almost 60 years later.<br><br>Ostensibly this is a western, but this movie is actually much more a
military movie than just a western. John Ford was a military man
himself, who ultimately retired as a Navy Reserve Rear Admiral. He knew
what the military was all about, he understood and enjoyed military
life, military ways, military customs, and military culture, and he
clearly relished making military depictions. So that's what we see
here. All that military stuff. Oddly, though, it all seems out of time
in a way. This movie was made in 1949, just a few years after WWII.
While making a movie about the cavalry fighting the Indian wars in
1876, the military culture Ford depicted seems more apropos of the
1940s than of the 1870s. For instance, I'm just not sold on this
version of history where US cavalry men were burdened with and hauled
around family members in the wild wild west. Maybe they did, but I'm
not so sure. It seems much more likely this was a device added to
appeal to 1949 audiences. There are other examples of this. This is the
only flaw in an otherwise very good movie. And who knows, maybe it
isn't a flaw at all, true or not. It's a good movie. Ford made a movie
in which he talked to all those recently mustered out veterans he knew
were out there populating his audiences. On that level he succeeds.

The second instalment of the acclaimed John Ford cavalry trilogy had a
lot to live up to after Fort Apache. So it may not be too controversial
to state that ""Yellow Ribbon"" doesn't quite achieve the potential
promise that Fort Apache's foundation building provided. However, here
is still a mighty western of many joys.<br><br>The lead theme here is the passing of time, of time and love lost, lest
we forget indeed. These themes give the film a strong emotional
heartbeat to work from, even if there is not much in the way of
adrenalin pumping. Accepting it as an affecting character piece is
something of a requisite if you want to get the most out of it, and of
course the gifted art of film making is very much on the film's side
here as well.<br><br>John Wayne gives a top notch performance in what is obviously one of
the first out and out serious roles that Ford gave him. His ageing
Captain Nathan Brittles requires him to put in a very fallible human
type performance, something that he achieves in spades. He's a
believable leader who is ruing the calling of time on his career in the
service. Yet even Wayne's affecting turn is trumped by some of the the
most gorgeous cinematography you could wish to see from the 1940s. <br><br>Winton Hoch clashed with Ford on the shoot about various perfections
(both parties equally to blame of course), but the final result is
incredible. Witness a scene as Brittles visits his dead wife's grave,
the backdrop is all purple and red, a storm is imminent, metaphorically
and in reality. Has shooting in the desert ever been so colourfully
lush?<br><br>The film leaves an indelible mark on the conscious for its art and
performances (Joanne Dru, Ben Johnson, Victor McLaglen &amp; Harry Carey Jr
bring their ""A"" Game), but as a story it just about gets by because
John Ford knows his onions and structures it with precision and a
genuine love of the genre and material to hand. 8/10

John Ford, perhaps the greatest film director of the last century, was
in love with the pioneering men and women that settled the west. Mr.
Ford had an amazing eye for the beauty of the land. This is a film
where he pays tribute and his undying admiration to the spirit of
adventure of those who dared and had a vision of the majesty of what
awaited them as the traveled west.<br><br>""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"", is a beautiful film to look at. The
glorious Technicolor utilized for the movie stands on its own as the
legacy of the director and his cinematographer Winton Hoch whose
photography of Monument Valley will remain the yard stick for which
other films will be judged. The atmospheric music of Richard Hagerman
adds another layer to the texture of this film. <br><br>John Wayne, an actor bigger than life, is at the center of the story.
He embodies all that meant justice and fairness when things weren't so
orderly in the country. Victor McLaglen makes an excellent appearance
as Sgt. Quincannon. John Agar and Ben Johnson did good work as the two
cavalry officers in love with the same woman. Mildred Natwick was good
as Abby Alshard, a no nonsense woman who has seen a lot. Ultimately,
Joanne Dru projects such a beautiful image as the young Olivia
Dandridge, the woman who wore the yellow ribbon in her hair and

The fact that the names of Captain Nathan Brittles and Sgts Tyree and
Quincannon have passed, not just into the mythology of the American
western, but of movies themselves is testament to the iconic status of
Ford's 1949 masterpiece, the second and best of what became known as
his cavalry trilogy. That their names are also burned into our
collective cinematic consciousness is also testament to the
performances of John Wayne, Ben Johnson and Victor McLaglen who are all
at their best here and yet are only part of a great ensemble that also
includes that very fine and undervalued actress Joanne Dru as well as
Mildred Natwick, John Agar, Harry Carey Jr and Arthur Shields.<br><br>The period is the Indian Wars that followed from the massacre of
General Custer and Ford filmed it mostly in his beloved Monument
Valley. It is largely devoid of the sentimentality of ""Rio Grande""
though it is never as dark nor as serious as ""Fort Apache"", (it
straddles the middle-ground magnificently; even the comic fight scene
doesn't sit uncomfortably), and while Ford may make the Indians the
villains of the piece he nevertheless bestows on them a kind of dignity
and some degree of respect. Ford's sentimentality isn't necessarily for
the cavalry but for the passing of the 'old' West and the loss of
Native American culture

SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON is, arguably, the most enduring and appealing of
John Ford's 'Cavalry' trilogy. While lacking the dramatic core of a fatally
flawed central character (FORT APACHE), or an estranged couple reunited by a
headstrong son (RIO GRANDE), the film offers a richly sentimental tale of a
crusty yet endearing career soldier (John Wayne)  facing retirement, in a
romanticized West where the cavalry stands as the only defense against the
combined might of the Indian nations. The combination of Wayne and the
cavalry in SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON is simply unbeatable!<br><br>Wayne, at 42, portrays the sixty-ish Capt. Nathan Brittles, and under Ford's
sure hand, is magnificent in the role. Whether chastising young lieutenants
(""Never apologize, mister, it's a sign of weakness""), complimenting an
enlisted man (""Keep it up, and you'll make a fine corporal, in three or four
years""), or kneeling at the grave of his long-dead wife, to share the news
of the day, Wayne's performance shows a subtlety and sensitivity that his
critics often claimed he lacked. When his commander, Major Allshard (George
O'Brien) refuses his request to rescue Lt. Cohill (John Agar) and two squads
who had performed rear guard duty, the anguish Wayne shows is heartbreaking.
This is an Oscar-caliber performance, from a vastly underrated
actor.<br><br>The rest of the cast measures up equally well. Victor McLaglen, as irascible
as ever, plays Irish Top Sergeant Quincannon, full of blarney and (a bit of)
whiskey. His morning scenes with Wayne, denying he'd been drinking, are
comic gems. As the young suitors of Joanne Dru (who plays a more traditional
role than in Howard Hawks' RED RIVER), Agar and Harry Carey Jr. are also
quite good. <br><br>The real 'find' of the film, however, is Ben Johnson, in only his second
major role. As Sgt. Tyree, ex-Confederate captain, and Brittles' best scout,
Johnson shows an easy-going charm, a (feigned) lack of respect (when asked
his opinion, he'd always begin with ""That's not my department..."" then make
a dead-on assessment), and astonishing riding skills (not surprising, as
Johnson had been a champion rodeo rider). A future Oscar winner, he displays
a charisma on-camera that would quickly earn him a place in the 'Ford
Family' of actors. <br><br>The visuals of SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON have been frequently compared to
Fredric Remington's classic paintings of cavalrymen and Indians, and the
comparison is justified; the film would win an Oscar for it's rich
Technicolor photography, and images of 'dirty blue' riders on horseback
against the stark blue sky and golden hues of Monument Valley are very
reminiscent of the artist's work.<br><br>SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON is the kind of film you can watch again and again,
and still find rewarding. It is on my 'short list' of favorite westerns, and
if you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a treat!

There is an ironic point about the production of SHE WORE A YELLOW
RIBBON immediately after FORT APACHE. Most critics agree that Col. Owen
Thursday, the martinet commander, is based on General George Armstrong
Custer, and that the massacre of his command due to his own pig
headedness is the battle of the Little Bighorn. But SHE WORE A YELLOW
RIBBON begins with that moment in the summer of 1876 when the entire
frontier was nervous after word came of the destruction of Custer
forces. The historic continuity (which is amazingly consistent, despite
minor anachronisms) is shown early when Captain Brittles, visiting his
wife's grave, mentions to her the death of Captain Miles Keogh at the
Little Bighorn. Historically this is correct. Keogh, a hero of the
American Civil War, served with Custer's Seventh Cavalry and died with
his commander and fellows. In fact, the only ""survivor"" of Custer's
forces at that disaster was Keogh's horse, ""Commanche"".<br><br>Captain Brittles has served in the American cavalry for thirty years.
He was one of those soldiers who held higher rank in the Civil War with
a ""Brevet"", but in the cutbacks in the army following the war (Custer
went from brevet major general to Lt. Col. in the regular army)Brittles
had to be satisfied with the rank of Captain. His wife and children
died (presumably of some epidemic illness at the post - they are buried
nearby). His old orderly from the war, Quincannon (Victor McLaglen) is
still serving him. But he is facing a crisis. His thirty years means
retirement, unless the army decides to promote him to Colonel. Despite
the debacle in Montana, it is not too likely that the politically
unconnected Brittles will get the promotion his fine abilities deserve.<br><br>So we are watching an old soldier slowly fade away in this film.
Brittles is aware he has days before he is to leave (unless a promotion
turns up), and he has to try to keep the hot blooded Indian braves,
impressed at what they just saw Crazy Horse and the Lakota forces
accomplish, go on the warpath. He also has to keep his two most
promising young officers (John Agar and Harry Carey Jr.) concentrating
on their careers rather than fighting over Joanne Dru. He is worried
too for Sgt. Quincannon, who is likewise going to be leaving the army a
few days after Brittles. Will Quincannon's drunken, roistering ways
ruin his chances to maintain his pension? And he has to keep an eye on
the suspicious behavior of the local fort sutler (Paul Fix) is up to -
can he be running guns? Whatever he faces, he faces unflinchingly, and
his motto is never to apologize - it's a sign of weakness.<br><br>For all the anachronisms listed on this thread, such as the 48 star
flag (in 1876?), Ford got the time and place perfect in what counts.
Note the fascinating relationship of Brittles and Sgt. Tyree (Ben
Johnson). 1876 was a crossroad year for the U.S. regarding the results
of the Civil War. In the negative, a questionable Presidential election
result was solidified when three southern states agreed to support the
Republican (Rutherford Hayes) over the Democrat (Samuel Tilden) in
return for the Federal troops being pulled out of the south and the
official end of Reconstruction policies benefiting southern
African-Americans. One can't deny that is still a stain in American
history (despite Hayes excellent handling of the Presidency
afterwords). But the former foes were finding less and less reason to
dislike each other, and more and more to admire the grit both sides had
shown. During the Civil War, Tyree was a Confederate Captain - he was
Brittles' equal in rank. Once the war ended, after a few years, he
joins the American Army and rises to the rank of Sergeant. Technically
he is not as high a Sergeant as Quincannon, who is Brittles' aide. But
Brittles constantly treats Tyree as a full equal, consulting him again
and again on how to move next when going out of the fort to confront
the Indian threat. The highpoint of this respect is when one of Tyree's
""soldiers"", ""Trooper Smith"" turns out to be a former Confederate
cavalry leader named Rome Clay, and dies of wounds in an action against
the Indians. Brittles and his men watch silently while Tyree and his
fellow southern soldiers bury Clay properly with his flag, the
Confederate one.<br><br>In terms of relations between the whites of the North and South, SHE
WORE A YELLOW RIBBON is miles away from the confrontations of, say THE
PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND. There John Carridine's northern officer has
nothing but fanatical contempt for Dr. Mudd, whom he considers evil for
helping John Wilkes Booth. Until the end of that film, Carridine takes
a sadistic interest in making Warner Baxter regret his every move. The
events of THE PRISONER was from 1865 - 1869 (when Mudd finally returned
to Maryland). This is seven years afterwords.<br><br>There are other little historical pointers. The rivalry of immigrant
groups is shown when Quincannon is facing rival Sergeant Hochbauer, who
openly dislikes the former as an overbearing Irishman (Hochbauer being
a German). There is the civilian clothes that are meant for Brittles
(complete with ""Muller cut-down hat"") that Quincannon ends sampling
(which leads to his hysterically funny fight with Hochbauer and the
other soldiers meant to take him to the guardhouse). Quincannon insists
he is not out of uniform (technically he is) but is simply dressed as a
retired gentleman should be. Yes, in 1876, that would be the dress of a
retired gentleman.<br><br>I like this film. The characterizations of the all the actors are
strong, and Ford had great set pieces in it. Perhaps not as great a
film as THE SEARCHERS (which is more meaty and dark), but a top notch
Western all the same.

'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon' remains for many viewers their favorite Ford
film, and it is certainly the most striking visually... Winton C. Hoch
won an Oscar for his Technicolor photography... <br><br>The compositions and photography around Ford's new stamping ground of
Monument valley are great to look at as always... The Monument Valley
goes from bright sunlight to hail and sleet...<br><br>There is a melancholy mixed together in those incredible vistas, with a
certain sense of dreamlike contemplation... A backdrop so complex but
so significant as the human characters...<br><br>Ford has superbly achieved a huge and composite demonstration of all
the legends of the frontier cavalryman... Never have the legendary
troops been through the silent 'Indian country' and across the
magnificent Western plains so brilliant, vivid, exciting and
romantic... <br><br>Ford has surely done better himself, unquestionably with 'My Darling
Clementine,' and 'The Searchers,' yet one has to admit the undisputed
merits of 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.' Even the usual criticism launched
against it-that it is a Western influenced by feeling rather by
reasoncan be dismissed at the start... Certainly Ford can be
sentimental but only when the springs of honest feeling run dry and
lose their inspiration, and this never really happens in 'She Wore a
Yellow Ribbon.'<br><br>The story is that of an older cavalry officer (John Wayne) who is six
days from retirement at Fort Stark when he's sent out, in a last
mission, to escort the Major's wife (Mildred Natwick) and her niece, an
attractive single lady (Joanne Dru) out of the danger area... Wayne
tries to fulfill his military role protecting his female charges
against the uprising of the Sioux, Cheyenne, Kiowa, Comanche and
Apaches...<br><br>Wayne possibly more than any other Western star has re-created and
heightened the mythology of the West-one has only to watch again his
absolute and ideal image in 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,' or his avenging
Ethan in 'The Searchers,' to be reminded of how irresistible the Duke
has been on the cinema screen...<br><br>'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon' is above all a sentimental movie, with
irresistible scenes, full of Ford's best touches:<br><br>- The cavalry engaged in its everyday work... Wayne simply can't
picture himself in a world far from the army...<br><br>- The comic interaction between Wayne and Victor McLaglen, two hardcore
professional officers...<br><br>- The bravery of Sgt. Tyree (Ben Johnson), chased by hostile Indians,
who must finish his mission by reporting to the captain what he saw...<br><br>- The rivalry of two young cavalry lieutenants (John Agar and Harry
Carey Jr.) in love with the same woman, each competing to have her wear
a yellow ribbon as a token of his love...<br><br>- The 'beloved brute,' the tough-soft cavalry sergeant sharing his
saddle with a little orphan rescued from a devastated stage station...<br><br>- Ford celebrating McLaglen's lachrymose in self-indulgent fisticuffs
in an epic saloon fight... <br><br>- The last inspection of the C. troops almost bringing tears to Wayne's
and the audience's eyes, as he reads the inscription that means so much
to him... <br><br>- Wayne riding into the war camp of the Indians to stop a war...<br><br>- The U. S. cavalry at full gallop descending upon the encampment,
firing wildly and stampeding hundred of Indian ponies... <br><br>- The evocative use of music, notably the gay and spirited theme song
of the yellow ribbon, played countless times...<br><br>'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon ' is an exciting story with strong characters
and sentiment, highly enjoyable, and beautiful...

The second of John Ford's cavalry trilogy that deals with the life of
the professional soldier is the only one that was photographed in
color. Lucky are we, the cinema fans two generations away.<br><br>She Wore A Yellow Ribbon has John Wayne the embodiment of the thirty
year army man. The year of the action of the film which is 1876 has
Wayne mentioning in passing that he was at the Battle of Chapultepec in
the Mexican War which started in 1846. Wayne's Nathan Brittles was by
his account a dirty shirt tailed runaway from his father's Ohio farm
when he joined the army. And now he's reached mandatory retirement.
He's married and has had a family who he's lost for reasons John Ford
doesn't explain in the film. But Wayne dutifully, ""makes his report"" at
their gravesides every night he's at the post.<br><br>Wayne's seen a lot of military history and a lot of tragedy. With no
family left, the United States Cavalry is his home and family. He
doesn't like the idea of retiring at all. In a later Ford film, The
Long Gray Line, Martin Maher says that all he knows and holds dear is
at West Point. Wayne could have said that line himself here.<br><br>Even though George O'Brien is the commanding officer at Fort Stark,
Wayne is the father figure for the whole post. And not like some of the
others don't behave like children. The whole romantic rivalry between
John Agar and Harry Carey, Jr. over Joanne Dru seems pretty childish.
Cute while in the safety of the post, but when out on a mission
downright dangerous and Wayne like the good father scolds his kiddies.<br><br>With some makeup to grey his hair and wrinkle him a might, Wayne turns
in one of his finest performances on the screen. Harry Carey, Jr. wrote
what is probably the most evenly balanced portrayal of the Duke in his
memoirs In the Company of Heroes. They didn't always get along, but
Carey says Wayne was an inspiration to him and the other younger cast
members. In fact during the scene with the gunrunners Paul Fix and
Grant Withers being killed in the Indian camp while Wayne, Carey, and
Agar watch on the ridge, the whole idea for the chaw of tobacco bit
came from Carey himself, but that Wayne encouraged the improvisation as
he was wont to do. <br><br>Other than the Duke, my favorite portrayal in the film is that of Ben
Johnson as Sergeant Tyree. Wayne recognizes in him a younger version of
himself. In fact Tyree is a former Confederate Army captain, a fact
brought out in the death scene of ""Trooper Smith"" another former
Confederate who in fact was a general in that army. Ben Johnson was a
real cowboy, a horse wrangler who John Ford gave a chance to act. He
graced many a film with his presence and won himself an Oscar to cap
his career in The Last Picture Show.<br><br>Like in Fort Apache and Rio Grande, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is the
story of the professional soldier and the sacrifices he makes when he
gives up his civilian status to serve his country. It's a universal
theme, not just confined to the USA. No one embodied that theme better
than did John Wayne as Nathan Brittles in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.

Anyone who thinks John Wayne can't act should see this movie and eat crow. 
A young man then, he played a cavalry officer on the verge of retirement. 
Watch his eyes (the sign of a great actor).  It's a wonder he wasn't even
nominated for the Academy Award for this role, which few in Hollywood could
pull off convincingly.<br><br>It's also a John Wayne western the woman in your life will probably like. 
Wayne talks tenderly at the grave of his wife, and even has a moment of
sucking back weeping when his men show their fondness for
him.<br><br>This bittersweet, elegaic film about a retiring officer on his last mission
doesn't have lots of action in it (Ford seems to have thrown in a fistfight
with McLaglin just because that actor had little to do, and though it's
corny, it has a wonderful beginning).  <br><br>Apart from Wayne, the reason to watch this is the cinematography.  Monument
valley, host to myriad westerns, never looked better.  They even captured a
marvelous thunderstorm in the background, in these days before special
effects (the cinematographer, who did snatch an Oscar, originally protested
the work, but Ford made him film the scene and they ended up with one of the
most striking natural scenes ever).<br><br>For years people didn't think Wayne could act.  Some, like me, grew up on
his later, post-""True Grit"" movies, when he did tend to walk through his
parts, more icon than actor.  He didn't have great finesse with his lines
(neither does a fine actor of today, Harrison Ford), but his roles rarely
called for the nicety of a Jeremy Irons.  In his better movies, Wayne proves
he's more than just a movie star.  This is his finest hour, and may be John
Ford's.

Like ""My Darling Clementine"", Ford used the name of a song and even more
than in Clementine, he deviated from the pattern of a standard
western. Although the basic structure is a story of war with
Indians,
there is more focus on the people, which are the essence of this great film.
Joanne Dru is the beautiful niece of the commanding officer and she thrives
on her power of seduction. When she wears the yellow ribbon, both John Agar
and Harry Carey Jr hope it is for them.
John Wayne is a captain who is going to retire, he is the one who knows it
all, and his relationship with Ben Johnson, an ex confederate, is a model of
human respect. Victor McLaglen is the strong,loyal Irishman who loves to
fight and drink. There are some incredibly beautiful shots of Monument
Valley in great color.When Joanne Dru at a certain moment feels guilty about
all the trouble she caused and says to Wayne she is sorry, he tells her not
to apologize for it is a sign of weakness, and considering all the
excitement and joy she brought to the cavalry, he is certainly
right.

It seems trite to say they don't make them like this anymore. But it's
a fact. They don't make them like this anymore. And it seems likely we
won't be seeing them making them like this ever again. This is John
Ford at the height of his career, at his best, doing what he did best.
On location in the Monument Valley, it is more than fair to say the
scenery, the colors, even the weather, along with Ford's
cinematography, particularly the patient framing of his shots and
making full use of the setting and environment in which he filmed, are
every bit as much stars of this film as are the featured human stars.<br><br>None of which is to say the human stars weren't good. John Wayne in the
lead turned in a remarkable performance. Wayne was 42-years old when he
made this, but he was playing a character much older than that, perhaps
as much as 20 years older, and Wayne pulls it off. He looks and seems
like a 60-year old man. He showed his acting chops here.<br><br>Ben Johnson had been around awhile at this point, mainly as a stuntman,
but here he makes one of his first forays into real acting, and he does
well, which no doubt boosted his career.<br><br>Perennial John Wayne sidekick Harry Carey, Jr. is here too, at the ripe
young age of 28. It occurs to me as I write this in November 2008 that
he seems to be the last surviving cast member of this movie.<br><br>Joanne Dru. What can be said? While this movie was made before I was
born, Joanne Dru plays the fetching young woman wearing the yellow
ribbon and stirring the male ashes deep inside as well as anybody ever
could, and she was quite fetching indeed. Her performance still
striking that chord precisely that way almost 60 years later.<br><br>Ostensibly this is a western, but this movie is actually much more a
military movie than just a western. John Ford was a military man
himself, who ultimately retired as a Navy Reserve Rear Admiral. He knew
what the military was all about, he understood and enjoyed military
life, military ways, military customs, and military culture, and he
clearly relished making military depictions. So that's what we see
here. All that military stuff. Oddly, though, it all seems out of time
in a way. This movie was made in 1949, just a few years after WWII.
While making a movie about the cavalry fighting the Indian wars in
1876, the military culture Ford depicted seems more apropos of the
1940s than of the 1870s. For instance, I'm just not sold on this
version of history where US cavalry men were burdened with and hauled
around family members in the wild wild west. Maybe they did, but I'm
not so sure. It seems much more likely this was a device added to
appeal to 1949 audiences. There are other examples of this. This is the
only flaw in an otherwise very good movie. And who knows, maybe it
isn't a flaw at all, true or not. It's a good movie. Ford made a movie
in which he talked to all those recently mustered out veterans he knew
were out there populating his audiences. On that level he succeeds.

The second instalment of the acclaimed John Ford cavalry trilogy had a
lot to live up to after Fort Apache. So it may not be too controversial
to state that ""Yellow Ribbon"" doesn't quite achieve the potential
promise that Fort Apache's foundation building provided. However, here
is still a mighty western of many joys.<br><br>The lead theme here is the passing of time, of time and love lost, lest
we forget indeed. These themes give the film a strong emotional
heartbeat to work from, even if there is not much in the way of
adrenalin pumping. Accepting it as an affecting character piece is
something of a requisite if you want to get the most out of it, and of
course the gifted art of film making is very much on the film's side
here as well.<br><br>John Wayne gives a top notch performance in what is obviously one of
the first out and out serious roles that Ford gave him. His ageing
Captain Nathan Brittles requires him to put in a very fallible human
type performance, something that he achieves in spades. He's a
believable leader who is ruing the calling of time on his career in the
service. Yet even Wayne's affecting turn is trumped by some of the the
most gorgeous cinematography you could wish to see from the 1940s. <br><br>Winton Hoch clashed with Ford on the shoot about various perfections
(both parties equally to blame of course), but the final result is
incredible. Witness a scene as Brittles visits his dead wife's grave,
the backdrop is all purple and red, a storm is imminent, metaphorically
and in reality. Has shooting in the desert ever been so colourfully
lush?<br><br>The film leaves an indelible mark on the conscious for its art and
performances (Joanne Dru, Ben Johnson, Victor McLaglen &amp; Harry Carey Jr
bring their ""A"" Game), but as a story it just about gets by because
John Ford knows his onions and structures it with precision and a
genuine love of the genre and material to hand. 8/10

John Ford, perhaps the greatest film director of the last century, was
in love with the pioneering men and women that settled the west. Mr.
Ford had an amazing eye for the beauty of the land. This is a film
where he pays tribute and his undying admiration to the spirit of
adventure of those who dared and had a vision of the majesty of what
awaited them as the traveled west.<br><br>""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"", is a beautiful film to look at. The
glorious Technicolor utilized for the movie stands on its own as the
legacy of the director and his cinematographer Winton Hoch whose
photography of Monument Valley will remain the yard stick for which
other films will be judged. The atmospheric music of Richard Hagerman
adds another layer to the texture of this film. <br><br>John Wayne, an actor bigger than life, is at the center of the story.
He embodies all that meant justice and fairness when things weren't so
orderly in the country. Victor McLaglen makes an excellent appearance
as Sgt. Quincannon. John Agar and Ben Johnson did good work as the two
cavalry officers in love with the same woman. Mildred Natwick was good
as Abby Alshard, a no nonsense woman who has seen a lot. Ultimately,
Joanne Dru projects such a beautiful image as the young Olivia
Dandridge, the woman who wore the yellow ribbon in her hair and
conquered the hearts of the men around her.<br><br>This is a classic film that serves to remind us about those people that
came before us, and, in the case of Nathan Brittles, Mr. Ford gives us
a decent man who wanted peace above all with the Indians that the white
man was displacing from their natural habitat.

though it is never as dark nor as serious as ""Fort Apache"", (it
straddles the middle-ground magnificently; even the comic fight scene
doesn't sit uncomfortably), and while Ford may make the Indians the
villains of the piece he nevertheless bestows on them a kind of dignity
and some degree of respect. Ford's sentimentality isn't necessarily for
the cavalry but for the passing of the 'old' West and the loss of

If so, you'll like ""Traces of Red"", a murder mystery in which Belushi
plays
a cop hot on the trail of a serial killer in Palm Beach, FL. Though the
flick misses the sweaty Florida noir atmospherics of ""Palmetto"" and ""Gold
Coast"" and dishes up a convoluted, not-to-be-taken-seriously plot, it does
feature the same old likeable tough guy Belushi in his slimmer days. Good
stuff for Belushi fans. Marginal, mediocre escapist stuff for everyone
else.

Overheated but good-looking and fairly entertaining murder mystery that
will
probably please most whodunit fans, despite (or, for some viewers, perhaps
BECAUSE of) its overly convoluted plot, which may even demand a second
viewing to get completely straightened out in one's head. James Belushi
gets
to show some ambiguity that's rare for him, but Lorraine Bracco's femme
fatale is a barely sexy disappointment.    (**)

****SPOILERS**** ""Traces of Red"" would have been a decent modern
Film-Noir thriller if it only ended like it started but the makers of
the movie had to add on some ten minutes to the story and that just
about destroyed it. Trying to be cute and twist and fool the audience
with an off-the-wall ending made it look both foolish and unconvincing
and it even showed on the faces of the actors in the film;as they tried
to keep a straight face and not crack up from laughing.The movie had
all the ingredients for a good police whodunit: a good cast beautiful
women and locations and even a part in the story that dates back some
thirty years. This dark secret has something to do with the murders and
is linked to the detective investigating the killings but that really
ridicules ending sunk the film. Det. Jack Dobson, James Belushi,is
investigating a number of murders of beautiful young and rich widows,
aren't they all, in rich and socially prominent Palm Beach Florida. <br><br>The killer purposely leaves clues that somehow tie all the killings to
Det. Dobson. The killer sends him letters after each murder with a kiss
mark on them that has the same kind of lipstick that the murdered women
had smeared on their lips after they were killed. The letters are typed
with an imperfection of the letters D &amp; L and it's obvious that the
killer wants the police or Det. Dobson to know this. <br><br>As the Palm Beach Police Department try to find out who the killer is
something comes up out of the blue about the detective on the case Det.
Dobson which has him taken off the case. It turns out that this person
Ross Worth knew one of the murdered women in Key West when she worked
at a nightclub there. The woman Morgan Cassidy, Michelle Joyner, just
happened to be Det. Dobson girlfriend!Now get this! Ross Worth's mother
Gloria Worth was arrested and put away for some twenty years for
molesting Det. Dobson when he was six years old when she was his first
grade teacher;it was Dobson's testimony that put her away. Mrs. Worth
died a week before the killing in Palm Beach started and the police
there think that it's her son Ross who's doing them to get revenge for
his mother. It's also found out that all the women killed were involved
with Det. Dobson. Taken off the case because of his possible connection
to the murders Det. Dobson is replaced by his partner Det. Frayn, Tony
Goldwyn, who flies to Key West to check out Ross Worth only to find out
that he died of AIDS the year before. Det. Frayn does find one of Det.
Dobson's lady friends another beautiful rich and widowed Palm Beach
socialite Ellen Schofield, Lorrain Bracco. Lorrain has a
one-night-stand with Det. Frayn, who's married, and later blackmails
him by calling his wife Beth, Faye Grant, and leaving a massage on the
phone recorder. Det. Dobson get very upset with his partner Det. Frayn
for having an affair with his girlfriend Ellen and Frayn's wife leaves
him with her young daughter. When Det. Frayn goes to see Ellen at her
home on the beach he finds her murdered.<br><br>The film was really starting to pick up and really become interesting
even up to the final minute but then the ""Surprise Ending"" came in and
just deep sixth the entire movie. I don't know why the movie-makers had
to put in that moronic ending. It may have been a way to make the star
of the movie James Belushi not look so bad. You already saw at the very
beginning of the film that he was killed and we were getting all this,
the story, from him from the grave in flashback. But that ""ending"" was
just too much and it took everything out of what was up until then a
fairly good crime/suspense film.

When homicide cop Jack Dobson starts getting threatening letters and has
his
car trashed, he and his partner assume that it is the work of a mobster
who
Jack is testifying against.  However when the writer of the letters starts
killing friends and lovers of his, Jack starts to investigate with the
killer's lipstick and a defective typewriter as his only
clues.<br><br>Opening with a shot of his own dead body, we are taken through this film
by
the narration of Jack himself, seemingly in an attempt to make it more
gritty and typical of the genre.  The plot spins wildly out of control -
but
not due to an abundance of ideas so much as just poor writing and poor
delivery of the finished product.  The connections between the various
dots
is not very important as the vast majority of the strands exist solely to
act as red herrings - although how you could ever hope to guess the
ridiculous twists that come at the end of this film is beyond me - the
makers needed have bothered trying to trick us!<br><br>The plot never manages to thrill at any point, which could be considered a
problem in a thriller.  The lack of clarity in any of the threads (never
mind their composite) means that you never really get involved enough to
be
gripping or indeed even care who the killer is or what their motivation
might be.  Having established that this erotic thriller has no thrills,
then
we are left with only the promise of the erotic!  Of course, as you might
imagine, this film doesn't deliver that either. Oh, it has nudity and some
quick scenes of sexual material but it is just lazily stuck in there to
widen the market appeal of this film - certainly if you came here looking
for, ahem, whacking material, then you will be very disappointed.<br><br>The cast is OK in regards names, but don't really do anything in regards
helping the film be better.  Belushi is as average as ever; I suppose he
does try to bring intense emotions out of his character here, but
generally
he is doing his usual stuff.  Goldwynn is OK but his main contribution
here
is another recognisable face.  Bracco tries hard but she is no Sharon
Stone!
She doesn't suit her hairstyle, never mind her character.  She tries but
she comes off silly - and her body double does her no favours during the
nude scenes - lying there as flaccid as a deflated balloon!<br><br>Overall this film is just poor.  In terms of thrills it is dull and so
incoherent and badly structured as to render any excitement dead.  If
you're
looking for erotic thrills then this film will disappoint you as well.
The
only moment of interest for me was the fact that the makers clearly took
bets to see how absurd a twist they could get away with.

Being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities I think it
should some more credit than it has been given on imdb.<br><br>It's your basic 'who done it?' thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you
guessing right to the end. I like these kinds of movies and I certainly
think this one meets the standard.<br><br>To me it was worth watching more than once so I'll give it an 8 on
imdb.

If so, you'll like ""Traces of Red"", a murder mystery in which Belushi
plays
a cop hot on the trail of a serial killer in Palm Beach, FL. Though the
flick misses the sweaty Florida noir atmospherics of ""Palmetto"" and ""Gold
Coast"" and dishes up a convoluted, not-to-be-taken-seriously plot, it does
feature the same old likeable tough guy Belushi in his slimmer days. Good
stuff for Belushi fans. Marginal, mediocre escapist stuff for everyone
else.

Nobody expects this to be a blockbuster, but it IS worth a watch for
Belushi
fans, and for those who like a very challenging plot.  The budget for this
film may not have been large, but it does present some grand, upscale
homes
and mansions, and beautiful south Florida and Keys scenery.<br><br>Jim has these cop/detective roles nailed, both as ""good guy"" and ""bad
guy"".
Here, he floats back and forth throughout the entire film.<br><br>Unbelievable, twisted, convoluted  plot?  Absolutely, but this is intended
to be entertaining fiction.  Watch it from the beginning, give it 15
minutes, and you may well be compelled to finish it.

Overheated but good-looking and fairly entertaining murder mystery that
will
probably please most whodunit fans, despite (or, for some viewers, perhaps
BECAUSE of) its overly convoluted plot, which may even demand a second
viewing to get completely straightened out in one's head. James Belushi
gets
to show some ambiguity that's rare for him, but Lorraine Bracco's femme
fatale is a barely sexy disappointment.    (**)

****SPOILERS**** ""Traces of Red"" would have been a decent modern
Film-Noir thriller if it only ended like it started but the makers of
the movie had to add on some ten minutes to the story and that just
about destroyed it. Trying to be cute and twist and fool the audience
with an off-the-wall ending made it look both foolish and unconvincing
and it even showed on the faces of the actors in the film;as they tried
to keep a straight face and not crack up from laughing.The movie had
all the ingredients for a good police whodunit: a good cast beautiful
women and locations and even a part in the story that dates back some
thirty years. This dark secret has something to do with the murders and
is linked to the detective investigating the killings but that really
ridicules ending sunk the film. Det. Jack Dobson, James Belushi,is
investigating a number of murders of beautiful young and rich widows,
aren't they all, in rich and socially prominent Palm Beach Florida. <br><br>The killer purposely leaves clues that somehow tie all the killings to
Det. Dobson. The killer sends him letters after each murder with a kiss
mark on them that has the same kind of lipstick that the murdered women
had smeared on their lips after they were killed. The letters are typed
with an imperfection of the letters D &amp; L and it's obvious that the
killer wants the police or Det. Dobson to know this. <br><br>As the Palm Beach Police Department try to find out who the killer is
something comes up out of the blue about the detective on the case Det.
Dobson which has him taken off the case. It turns out that this person
Ross Worth knew one of the murdered women in Key West when she worked
at a nightclub there. The woman Morgan Cassidy, Michelle Joyner, just
happened to be Det. Dobson girlfriend!Now get this! Ross Worth's mother
Gloria Worth was arrested and put away for some twenty years for
molesting Det. Dobson when he was six years old when she was his first
grade teacher;it was Dobson's testimony that put her away. Mrs. Worth
died a week before the killing in Palm Beach started and the police
there think that it's her son Ross who's doing them to get revenge for
his mother. It's also found out that all the women killed were involved
with Det. Dobson. Taken off the case because of his possible connection
to the murders Det. Dobson is replaced by his partner Det. Frayn, Tony
Goldwyn, who flies to Key West to check out Ross Worth only to find out
that he died of AIDS the year before. Det. Frayn does find one of Det.
Dobson's lady friends another beautiful rich and widowed Palm Beach
socialite Ellen Schofield, Lorrain Bracco. Lorrain has a
one-night-stand with Det. Frayn, who's married, and later blackmails
him by calling his wife Beth, Faye Grant, and leaving a massage on the
phone recorder. Det. Dobson get very upset with his partner Det. Frayn
for having an affair with his girlfriend Ellen and Frayn's wife leaves
him with her young daughter. When Det. Frayn goes to see Ellen at her
home on the beach he finds her murdered.<br><br>The film was really starting to pick up and really become interesting
even up to the final minute but then the ""Surprise Ending"" came in and
just deep sixth the entire movie. I don't know why the movie-makers had
to put in that moronic ending. It may have been a way to make the star
of the movie James Belushi not look so bad. You already saw at the very
beginning of the film that he was killed and we were getting all this,
the story, from him from the grave in flashback. But that ""ending"" was
just too much and it took everything out of what was up until then a
fairly good crime/suspense film.

When homicide cop Jack Dobson starts getting threatening letters and has
his
car trashed, he and his partner assume that it is the work of a mobster
who
Jack is testifying against.  However when the writer of the letters starts
killing friends and lovers of his, Jack starts to investigate with the
killer's lipstick and a defective typewriter as his only
clues.<br><br>Opening with a shot of his own dead body, we are taken through this film
by
the narration of Jack himself, seemingly in an attempt to make it more
gritty and typical of the genre.  The plot spins wildly out of control -
but
not due to an abundance of ideas so much as just poor writing and poor
delivery of the finished product.  The connections between the various
dots
is not very important as the vast majority of the strands exist solely to
act as red herrings - although how you could ever hope to guess the
ridiculous twists that come at the end of this film is beyond me - the
makers needed have bothered trying to trick us!<br><br>The plot never manages to thrill at any point, which could be considered a
problem in a thriller.  The lack of clarity in any of the threads (never
mind their composite) means that you never really get involved enough to
be
gripping or indeed even care who the killer is or what their motivation
might be.  Having established that this erotic thriller has no thrills,
then
we are left with only the promise of the erotic!  Of course, as you might
imagine, this film doesn't deliver that either. Oh, it has nudity and some
quick scenes of sexual material but it is just lazily stuck in there to
widen the market appeal of this film - certainly if you came here looking
for, ahem, whacking material, then you will be very disappointed.<br><br>The cast is OK in regards names, but don't really do anything in regards
helping the film be better.  Belushi is as average as ever; I suppose he
does try to bring intense emotions out of his character here, but
generally
he is doing his usual stuff.  Goldwynn is OK but his main contribution
here
is another recognisable face.  Bracco tries hard but she is no Sharon
Stone!
She doesn't suit her hairstyle, never mind her character.  She tries but
she comes off silly - and her body double does her no favours during the
nude scenes - lying there as flaccid as a deflated balloon!<br><br>Overall this film is just poor.  In terms of thrills it is dull and so
incoherent and badly structured as to render any excitement dead.  If
you're
looking for erotic thrills then this film will disappoint you as well.
The
only moment of interest for me was the fact that the makers clearly took
bets to see how absurd a twist they could get away with.

By her own admission, she turned down every role offered of a victimized, weak woman.      In the early 1990s, as Rheumatoid Arthritis began impacting her acting career and her personal life in a significant way, she also began to see a decline in the number of acting roles she was being offered. When the diagnosis was finally made in 1992, she had already been suffering with ""unbearable"" pain for over one year. By that time, she could not easily turn her head, and was already having difficulty walking, and her doctors told her that she was most likely going to be needing a wheelchair to remain mobile. By the mid to late 1990s, the progression of the illness and the medications (steroids, among others) to treat the illness quickly began to change her appearance. All of this caused her once vibrant acting career to slow considerably. Due to newly available drugs and other treatments, her Rheumatoid Arthritis has been in remission since 2006.

Her mother, Patsy (Magee) Turner, passed away on February 13th, 2015, aged 91.Personal Quotes (33)      A woman my age is not supposed to be attractive or sexually appealing. I just get kinda tired of that.      I feel I get recognized for my voice more than for my face.      I know there are nights when I have that power, when I could put on something and walk in somewhere, and if there\'s a man there who doesn\'t look at me, it\'s because he\'s gay.      I learned years ago, I adore acting and I think it\'s the most alive I know how to be -- almost -- but I really want a good life. I\'ve been married for 17 years -- I know, they call us the last couple. I have a 13-year-old daughter. I have a lovely home life with good friends who aren\'t in the business... and I have no desire to cost my whole life in pursuit of the career alone.      When I was 20, I had so many more insecurities and looked for approbation from everyone. But by the time I was 40 and now at 50, you wake up and think, ""Fuck you, I don\'t have to prove myself anymore"", and that makes you sexy.      I often play women who are not essentially good or likable, and I often go through a stage where I hate them. And then I find the reasons why they are that way, and end up loving and defending them.      It\'s always been my first love, I never feel more alive than when I\'m on stage. On film you feel chopped up, you can be acting from the neck up, or the hand, there is a lot of close up.      Then when I was about 40, the roles started slowing down. I started getting offers to play mothers and grandmothers. I\'d say the cut-off point for leading ladies today is 35/40, whereas half the men in Hollywood get their start then. It\'s a terrible double standard.      I find the idea of today\'s icons being teenagers incredibly uninspiring. I think the Europeans have enough tradition and respect for the experience and body of work of an actress that they don\'t sell out to the new ones.      I\'m not a naturalistic actor. I believe acting is a planned process of communication. I don\'t see anything naturalistic about it.      The studios are no longer creative institutions. Their job is to raise a great deal of money for their shareholders, to hedge their bets about risk. All this does not spell creativity. You might as well be talking real estate. Thank goodness for the independents. Except that distribution is still controlled by the studios. So they take the first week\'s profit and, after that, they don\'t give a damn. They take their money and they leave. It sucks.      [on what was her most embarrassing moment] When I met Gregory Peck and he said, ""You have a lovely voice."" And I replied, ""Oh, so do you, sir!"" What an idiot. It was my first Oscars, so I was very young.      [on what is the most important lesson life has taught her] That you are not the center of the world.      I do not have a great deal of belief in the so-called method. Yes, you run into actors who have to have their quiet time, you must not speak to them as they\'re preparing or they want to be called by their character\'s name not their own since that jars them out of their reality. And you go, ""Okay fine, whatever you need. Just stay out of my way."".      [on her divorce] I don\'t think there is a simple explanation. I don\'t think there ever is. I think we became too difficult for each other because our lives were going different ways. He wanted to be part of the public world less and less. He was tired of the publicity, and the travel, and being, as he would call it, ""Mr. Turner"".      [on Rheumatoid arthritis] The day I was told, I went from the hospital to kindergarten for a meeting with my daughter\'s teacher and looked at these little chairs and started crying because I knew there was no way I would be able to get into that chair.      [on her looks] You know, I was so naive. Still am. When I arrived in L.A., Michael Douglas, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, they would all call me up. And I thought: how nice, they are looking after me. It was only later I found out it was a competition to see who could get the new girl.      [on the differences between the West End and Broadway] On Broadway, the star gets an automatic standing ovation. In the West End, they don\'t. I swear this is true, or if it isn\'t, Dustin Hoffman won\'t kill me. But he was here (in the West End) in ""The Merchant of Venice"" when Laurence Olivier passed away, and at the end he said: ""It is my sad duty to inform you that Lord Olivier has died."" And the audience rose to their feet. And as Dustin was going off, he muttered: ""You have to die, you have to fucking die."".      [on Hollywood (1995)] We need women producers, writers and executives. Otherwise, it is like expecting male senators to write legislation for us. Hollywood in general is at least 10 to 15 years behind the times. We just last year made a big fuss over Tom Hanks playing gay.      [on the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences] I would encourage more young people to join, because the average age now is over 60. Not to sound sour grapes, but I think there is a lot of politics involved. They like a classic with the hottest young actors who can barely speak English. Oooh, didn\'t I sound like an old lady then?      [on Danny DeVito] He provides a sickness, the tastelessness, that dark underside. It\'s like being groped all day long - being somewhat short, he gets to casually drape his arm around parts of your anatomy that no one usually would.      [on Robert Zemeckis] I remember terrible arguments doing Romancing. He\'s a film-school grad, fascinated by cameras and effects. I never felt that he knew what I was having to do to adjust my acting to some of his damn cameras - sometimes he puts you in ridiculous postures. I\'d say, \'This is not helping me! This is not the way I like to work, thank you!      [on Jack Nicholson] There\'s this thing when you\'re the new girl in town in L.A., right? And they all have to take you out for dinner and make sure they get a shot at you. I\'m an old-fashioned Midwestern girl, so this doesn\'t work well for me. Once we got that straight we were friends.      [on the Oscars] They just don\'t vote for comedies, do they? I think I need a good crying scene.      [on Francis Ford Coppola] I\'m really about the only lead woman he\'s worked with. He\'s shy, but we worked out well. I said, \'You give me a martini at the end of the day and everything will be fine.      [on Lawrence Kasdan] I find his sense of humor is rather low, but he thinks I\'m stuffy.      [on Steve Martin] Steve just wasn\'t somebody you want to grab a beer with after work. I don\'t know why he\'s so contained, but when the camera\'s rolling, he\'s a genius.      Being a sex symbol has to do with an attitude, not looks. Sexuality is not just looks; it\'s a sense you have of yourself. I think most men think it\'s all looks; most women know otherwise.      No, I don\'t look like I did 30 years ago. Get over it.      I sign more Jessica Rabbit photos than mine, almost. I\'m not kidding. Isn\'t that crazy?      We have no National Theater support in this country. However, we have some wonderful regional theaters. Face it, in New York on Broadway we don\'t really create much work or new talent, it comes into Broadway after it\'s been elsewhere. The regional theaters are what we need, so every year (or two years at most), I work at a regional theater. It makes a difference.      [on Serial Mom (1994)] I walked into a storm of resistance, from agents, friends, actors, everyone. ""You\'re an A-movie actress and he\'s a B-movie director!"" I said, ""He\'s made films that have touched and moved people all over the world!""      [on Serial Mom (1994)] They never got it. I was sitting in this screening with one of the heads of the studio. He turned to me and said, ""It\'s a comedy?!"" And I [thought], ""Oh, we\'re in so much trouble.""Salary (1)Body Heat\xa0(1981)      $30,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nJay O.

The stockily built Charles Durning was one of Hollywood\'s most dependable and sought after supporting actors.Durning was born in Highland Falls, New York, to Louise Marie (Leonard), a laundress, and James Gerald Durning. His father was an Irish immigrant and his mother was of Irish descent. Durning first got his start in guest appearances in early 1960\'s TV shows. He scored minor roles over the next decade until he really got noticed by film fans as the sneering, corrupt cop ""Lt. Snyder"" hassling street grifter \'Robert Redford\' in the multi award winning mega-hit The Sting (1973). Durning was equally entertaining in the Billy Wilder production of The Front Page (1974), he supported screen tough guy Charles Bronson in the suspenseful western Breakheart Pass (1975) and featured as ""Spermwhale Whalen"" in the story of unorthodox police behavior in The Choirboys (1977).The versatile Durning is equally adept at comedic roles and demonstrated his skills as ""Doc Hopper"" in The Muppet Movie (1979), a feisty football coach in North Dallas Forty (1979), a highly strung police officer berating maverick cop Burt Reynolds in Sharky\'s Machine (1981), and a light footed, dancing Governor (alongside Burt Reynolds once more) in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982). Durning continued a regular on screen association with Burt Reynolds appearing in several more feature films together and as ""Dr. Harlan Elldridge"" in the highly popular TV series Evening Shade (1990). On par with his multitude of feature film roles, Durning has always been in high demand on television and has guest starred in Everybody Loves Raymond (1996), Monk (2002) and Rescue Me (2004). Plus, he has appeared in the role of ""Santa Claus"" in five different television movies.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       firehouse44@hotmail.com          Spouse (2)               Mary Ann Amelio          (1974            - 24 December\xa02012)\xa0(his death)                         Carole Doughty          (1959            - 1972)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(3 children)          Trade Mark (1)        Usually has played burly and tough but genial charactersTrivia (21)      Was a ballroom dance instructor in his early career.

Has played Santa Claus five times to date, in It Nearly Wasn\'t Christmas (1989), Mrs. Santa Claus (1996), Elmo Saves Christmas (1996), Mr. St. Nick (2002), and A Boyfriend for Christmas (2004).      He died at his home in Manhattan (NYC). He was laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery.      Won Broadway\'s 1990 Tony Award as Best Actor (Featured Role - Play) for portraying Big Daddy in a revival of Tennessee Williams\' ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.""      He met Mary Ann Amelio, his second wife, after his discharge from the army. He met her again while in ""That Championship Season"" on Broadway. They then married in 1974 and were legally separated in 2010.      His military records from the National Archives show that he arrived in Normandy on June 15, 1944 and was wounded the same day by shrapnel from an exploding German ""S"" mine. He received his first and only Purple Heart for this wound. Arlington National Cemetery recently recut his headstone to reflect the award of only one Purple Heart Medal. His medical records state that all the shrapnel was removed so there was no metal remaining in his body.      Was kicked out of the American Academy of Dramatic Art drama school because they thought he had no talent. Another famous thespian to be booted from the school was Jason Robards.      His first job in the entertainment field was as an usher at a burlesque house. His career officially started as a singer with a band at the age of 16, before going into acting. His first professional play was in Buffalo before he went off to war.      His breakthrough role occurred on Broadway in 1972 starring in ""That Championship Season"" where he was noticed by director George Roy Hill who cast him in his acclaimed Oscar-winning movie The Sting (1973).      Despite the wounds he received in WWII (he was shot in the legs and hip by machine-gun fire), he went on to become a professional dancer and dance teacher. He taught at the Fred Astaire studios and relied upon it when he couldn\'t find acting work.      Was considered for the role of General Worden in The Dirty Dozen (1967).      He was the ninth of ten children, but five of his sisters died of smallpox or scarlet fever in childhood, three of them within two weeks. His surviving siblings were James (1915-2000), Clifford (1916-1994), Frances (born 1919) and Gerald Durning (born 1926). His mother, Louise (Leonard), who was of Irish descent, was a laundress at West Point, and his father, James Durning, was an Irish immigrant who had been badly wounded in World War I, just as Charles would be in WW II. He died when Charles was 12.      He had three children with his first wife, Carole: daughters, Michele and Jeanine; and a son, Douglas Edward.      Passed away on same day as actor Jack Klugman.      Appeared in three films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: The Sting (1973), Dog Day Afternoon (1975) and Tootsie (1982). Of those, The Sting (1973) is a winner in the category.      Developed an interest in Acting at the age of 28 when, while working as an usher, he was called onstage to replace a drunken Actor. Durning said he was hooked when he first heard the audience laugh.      In off-Broadway production of ""The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui"", Bertolt Brecht\'s Nazi Allegory set in Chicago. [October 2002]      Was the recipient of the 44th Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award for 2007. [December 2007]      His life and military service honored as part of the 24th National Memorial Day concert, which features Joe Mantegna and Gary Sinise. [May 2013]      Started his show business career in burlesque.      Born twenty-four days after Conrad Bain. He also passed away within a month of Bain.Personal Quotes (17)      Dancing came easy for me. Acting came hard.      I would rather do a play because it\'s instantaneous. You go on the stage, and you know whether it\'s happening or not. Somebody asked me ""what is acting?"" And I said, ""acting is listening."" And if you ain\'t listening, nobody\'s listening.      I can\'t count how many of my friends are in the cemetery at Normandy, the heroes are still there, the real heroes.      [about arriving at Omaha Beach on D-Day] It\'s hard to describe what we all went through that day, but those of us who were there will understand. We were frightened all the time. My sergeant said \'are you scared, son?\' and I said \'yes, I am\', and he said \'that\'s good, it\'s good to be scared\', he said \'we all are\'. This guy in the boat, he turned to me and he threw up all over me, and I got seasick. He was scared. You\'re not thinking about anything, you\'re just thinking about you hope that shell that just went off isn\'t going to hit this boat. Even the guys who had seen a lot of action before, and this was my first time, they were just as ashen as I was, and I was frightened to death. I was the second man off my barge and the first and third men got killed. First guy the ramp went down, the guy fell and I tried to leap over him and I stumbled and we both slipped into the water. We were supposed to be able to walk into shore but they didn\'t bring us far enough. And I was in 60 feet of water with a 60 pound pack on, so I let it all go.      [on reaching Omaha Beach after falling in the water] I came up and I didn\'t have a helmet, a rifle, nothing. I hit the beach, the guys pulled me in who were already there, I\'d lost everything; but they said \'you\'ll find plenty of them on the beach, rifles, helmets, that belong to nobody\'. Nobody knew where we were supposed to go, there was nobody in charge, you were on your own. All around me people were being shot at, I saw bodies all over the place; but you didn\'t know if they were alive or dead, they were just lying there.      [about D-Day] We got behind this tank to protect ourselves; we\'re holding our own when they called us over to them. I asked the sergeant \'you want me to go first or you go first?\' He said \'you go first, I\'ll be right behind you\'. I heard an explosion, and I turned around, and his torso was here, and his body was over there.      [on what he thought his image was] Image? Hell, I don\'t have an image.      There are many secrets in us, in the depths of our souls, that we don\'t want anyone to know about. There\'s terror and repulsion in us, the terrible spot that we don\'t talk about. That place no one knows about -- horrifying things we keep secret. A lot of that is released through acting.      Of course, I\'m not often the top dog, but sometimes it\'s better not to be top dog, because you last longer. If a movie or play flops, you always blame the lead. They say: ""He couldn\'t carry it."" They always blame him. But they rarely blame the second or third banana.      [from an interview in 2008] They\'re going to carry me out, if I go.      I never turned down anything and never argued with any producer or director.      [from a 1997 interview] If I\'m not in a part, I drive my wife crazy. I\'ll go downstairs to get the mail, and when I come back I\'ll say, ""Any calls for me?"".      \'A Chorus Line\' is an actor\'s play about actors. When that girl starts singing \'What I Did for Love\', it has nothing to do with sex. It\'s the love of the theatre - the horror, the heartbreak, the disappointments. We\'ve all had our share.      [Advice on acting] The thing to do is to keep taking chances. If you\'re going to learn anything, you\'ve got to learn from the masters. Plus you\'ve got to work with the talented beginner too.      I was in the business ten years before the actors began to notice me. Then it took another five years before the agents and producers noticed me. Five years after that, the public found me. And five or six years later, the critics took note.      James Cagney is probably the reason I became an actor. I think I learned much of what I know about acting from watching James Cagney movies. When people ask me, I tell them I didn\'t go to school. I learned directly from Cagney.      Part of my life I tried to keep secret... and deliberately. When I first got into this business and told people that I was in burlesque, they immediately characterized me. Right away, when they say \'burlesque,\' you think of Bert Lahr, Phil Silvers, Red Skelton... they\'re all comics, and they\'re all great. I had none of their ability.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nAngela Goethals ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 14 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(9)  Overview (3)Date of Birth20\xa0May1977,\xa0New York City, New York, USA Birth NameAngela Bethany GoethalsHeight5\'\xa04""\xa0(1.63\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Angela Goethals was born on May 20, 1977 in New York City, New York, USA as Angela Bethany Goethals.

It is remarkable to me how much affection and revulsion this watchable,
incomplete misfire of a film can inspire, here among the Comments and
elsewhere; I haven't seen more than a few minutes of it for several
years, but did see it in a theater in its original run. Kathleen Turner
as VIW is too much a flirt to conform to Sara Paretsky's portrait of
her detective, but otherwise gives a decent performance that, better
than the script, gets across Warshawski's toughness, wit and
unwillingness to suffer fools any more than she has to. The film, as
someone else noted, would've done well to be a more faithful adaptation
of one of the early novels, rather than pulling bits from several and
then letting the plot go completely slack by the last third. But there
are nice touches, here and there; Wayne Knight was born to play the
petty thug and childhood schoolmate of Warshawski. But the hastiness
and corner-cutting of the production is unfortunately evident. One
wonders if a second film, with a better script and crew, might've been
quite good.

For the time this movie was released, it really is a solid film. One I
stop and watch anytime I catch it on cable. I like Kathleen Turner as
Vic and see her as Vic when I read Paretsky's Blacklist (2004) and
Indemity Only (1982). Paretsky is such a skilled writer that I read all
332 pages of Indemity Only completely in one Saturday. This would have
been a good vehicle/series for Ms. Turner if the movie had followed the
novels closer. They should have hired Paretsky to write the screen
play.<br><br>The screenwriters, Edward Taylor, David Aaron Cohen, &amp; Nick Thiel, I
believe are responsible for this film being unsuccessful at the box
office. It appears they did not read the books or believe themselves
that a women could be a private investigator. Paretsky gave them a well
rounded, gritty, thorough character. The screenwriters tried to make it
a comedy/action film and dishonored Paretsky in their representation of
her character. The screen play should have been written as an
action/thriller along the lines of Patriot Games (1992), an
action/crime like the Italian Job (2003), or a mystery along the lines
of the Thomas Crown affair (1999). All have comedic moments in them and
would be better genres for the V.I. Warshawki novels.<br><br>Maybe if Ms. Turner is up to it she could revive the character or
perhaps Charlize Theron would take a shot at it.

Viewed this movie on 11/20/04, and it was so entertaining that it kept
me up until two in the morning. My wife, who has markedly different
tastes than I do, liked it enough to stay up with me. Imagine my
surprise when I went to Maltin to look up a character, and found it
classed as a BOMB. He panned it as wretchedly scripted, directed and
photographed. To the contrary, I found the script to be easily
followed, something that is getting more and more rare in this age of
obscure scripts. If it was poorly directed, the actors are geniuses,
becaust the scenes hung together well, were understandable and seemed
completely natural, even though the story line was a bit picaresque.
The photography was certainly adequate to tell the story without
intruding on it.<br><br>Maltin and I may have seen different movies, because his plot summary
spoke of a murdered hockey player, and without betraying too much of
the plot, there were plenty of murders but no hockey player in the
movie I saw. The plot in the movie I saw was delightfully complex, with
a number of twists and turns that would have done O'Henry proud. All in
all, it was two hours well spent.

In the 1980's Kathleen Turner was a tremendous star. Several of her
films were huge box-office hits:""Romancing the Stone""(1984), ""Jewel of
the Nile""(1986), ""Peggy Sue Got Married""(Best Actress Oscar
nomination,1986), and ""The War of the Roses""(1989). Critics loved her
in John Huston's ""Prizzi's Honor""(1985) and ""The Accidental
Tourist""(1987). Her sexy voice helped make ""Who Framed Roger
Rabbit""(1988) an enormous blockbuster. And who can forget her
star-making performance that made her quite the sex-symbol in ""Body
Heat""(1981). When ""V.I. Warshawski"" came out Turner was still at her
peak. The huge success of ""War of the Roses"" made her the #1 female
star at US BoxOffices in early 1990. But ""V.I."" opened to disastrous
reviews. She is actually very good in it but the script is so mediocre
and the direction is so flat. She is given nothing to work with but her
vibrant personality and sultry looks keep it together. The film ended
up pulling in only 12 million in the US. This disaster immediately
derailed Turner's career. Male stars like Bruce Willis and Nicolas Cage
can star in one flop after another pulling in huge salaries but it does
not matter as long as they get an occasional blockbuster. But take a
huge Female star like Turner- give her one colossal dud and she is more
or less finished in Hollywood. Turner's career never recovered. A few
more mediocre duds followed then her looks went so now she is stuck in
supporting roles that make it hard to believe she was once among the
greatest of female stars. Maybe she can make a comeback as a star
character actress. WHo knows.

I have just seen Kathleen Turnjer in ""V.I. Warshawski"" for the third
time and, for the third time, am at a total loss to understand the
panning/overall rating of 4.3 awarded to it by previous reviewers. I
think the movie DOES reflect a lot of the Paretsky original novels and
think Turner does a good job in portraying ""the dick from the dock"" in
a manner which combines both respect for the literary character and the
kind of gritty, down-to-earth film noir genre which the film obviously
pays its debts to. This latter aspect is particularly apparent in the
DIALOGUE, much of which my wife and I found hysterical and easily on a
par with such remakes of Chandler as the ""Farewell, My Lovely"" version
of the 1970s with Robert Mitchum and Charlotte Rampling. Like the
letter, ""V.I."" is not going to be rated as ""The Maltese Falcon"" or ""The
Big Sleep"" of the 1990s, but I still think it is a sound, entertaining
and engaging piece of work, which does not deserve the reviews
mentioned above. Now that we are past the ""Blow 'em up / SFX-dominated""
fayre of ""Die Hard 27""or whatever, is it time for a follow-up to what
was, in my view, sadly, Turner's sole donning of the red glitter shoes
of V.I. with another actress in the role?

V.I. Warshawski is my all-time favorite movie, and I don't know why people
keep butchering it so bad. It's an intriguing mystery that pulls you in and
doesn't let you go until the end.<br><br>Kathleen Turner shines as detective Victoria Warshawksi whom is hired by the
13 year old girl, Kat, she is babysitting to find out who murdered her
father. With suspects at every corner, Vic doesn't know who to trust and who
not to. Kat joins forces with Vic in a more helpful approach to the
situation, getting information that Vic can't obtain herself eliminating
suspects and narrowing it down to one. The ending will blow your mind, as it
isn't expected.<br><br>Filmed on Chicago's waterfront, V.I. Warshawski delivers the goods for
intrigue, mystery, and top notch action! If you haven't seen it, give it a

this movie unbearable to watch because it's an outstanding film and one of
Kathleen Turner's best.

As a native of Chicago, I can't say enough about how beautifully the
city was photographed in this movie. As for the film itself, the story
kept moving at an engaging pace as detective V.I. Warshawski ""follows
the money"" and solves the murder of a former pro hockey player. Turner
is aggressive, sexy, sultry, and vulnerable in this role. Maybe more
street-smart, Chicago toughness in her delivery. The writing, overall,
was adequate. Warshawski's general observations about the stupidity and
gullibility of men tasted to me like watered-down feminism on a piece
of stale, Chicago deep-dish pizza after a while. I wasn't often
convinced that the female detective was a physical threat to the male
villains. The ending with a double-opponent elimination was OK but I
would like to have seen her action skills equal those of Bruce Willis
for true equality to prevail. After all, the key to this action genre
is the ability of the detective to overcome overwhelming physical and
mental opposition. A pleasant, movie-of-the-week kind of yarn, though
better. And that beautiful city!

This movie does have some things going for it; above all, the
performances of Kathleen Turner and Angela Goethals. Turner fits the
profile of her character and is believably tough, sarcastic and funny,
while Goethals is one of the best teen actresses I've seen in a while,
with a sharp timing that matches Turner; those two make an enjoyable
team. And yet something holds the movie back from being anything more
than a passable diversion - maybe it's the plot, which is interesting
for the most part but gets a little too far-fetched at the end (without
spoiling anything, I couldn't easily accept that ""person A"" was so
intent on killing ""person B""), or maybe it's the direction, which
doesn't have enough style and doesn't make much use of the Chicago
locations (apart from a boat chase). It's kind of a shame that this
movie didn't get any sequels - they had the right actress for the part,
all they needed was a better vehicle for her. ** out of 4.

""V.I. Warshawski"" (Kathleen Turner) is a private detective who is hired
by a former hockey player named ""Bernard 'Boom Boom' Grafalk"" (Stephen
Meadows) to investigate some deals involving his two brothers. When her
client is murdered she not only inherits the murder case but
temporarily gets Bernard's 13 year-old daughter ""Kat"" (Angela Goethals)
as well. Throw in a shady mob figure by the name of ""Smeissen"" (Wayne
Knight), a fatherly cop ""Lt. Mallory"" (Charles Durning) and a
two-timing newspaper journalist named ""Murray"" (Jay O. Sanders) and
what develops is a good action movie with plenty of humor along the
way. Now, while this movie certainly has some faults what I liked best
about it was the performance of Kathleen Turner who I thought did quite
well in spite of some weak dialogue and a couple of rather obvious and
predictable scenes. She also had some great legs. In any case, I
enjoyed the movie and I rate it as slightly above average.

I keep thinking the other people who have commented on this movie saw a
different movie than I did.  I totally enjoyed it, Kathleen Turner delivers
a wisecrack better than anyone and her mocking laugh in the bathtub scene
is
too much!  She shows her vulnerable side yet you know that V.I. can take
care of herself when she has to.  The foul mouthed little girl made me
cringe a little with her first words in the movie. The chemistry between

give it 4 stars out of 5.

It is remarkable to me how much affection and revulsion this watchable,
incomplete misfire of a film can inspire, here among the Comments and
elsewhere; I haven't seen more than a few minutes of it for several
years, but did see it in a theater in its original run. Kathleen Turner
as VIW is too much a flirt to conform to Sara Paretsky's portrait of
her detective, but otherwise gives a decent performance that, better
than the script, gets across Warshawski's toughness, wit and
unwillingness to suffer fools any more than she has to. The film, as
someone else noted, would've done well to be a more faithful adaptation
of one of the early novels, rather than pulling bits from several and
then letting the plot go completely slack by the last third. But there
are nice touches, here and there; Wayne Knight was born to play the
petty thug and childhood schoolmate of Warshawski. But the hastiness
and corner-cutting of the production is unfortunately evident. One
wonders if a second film, with a better script and crew, might've been
quite good.

For the time this movie was released, it really is a solid film. One I
stop and watch anytime I catch it on cable. I like Kathleen Turner as
Vic and see her as Vic when I read Paretsky's Blacklist (2004) and
Indemity Only (1982). Paretsky is such a skilled writer that I read all
332 pages of Indemity Only completely in one Saturday. This would have
been a good vehicle/series for Ms. Turner if the movie had followed the
novels closer. They should have hired Paretsky to write the screen
play.<br><br>The screenwriters, Edward Taylor, David Aaron Cohen, &amp; Nick Thiel, I
believe are responsible for this film being unsuccessful at the box
office. It appears they did not read the books or believe themselves
that a women could be a private investigator. Paretsky gave them a well
rounded, gritty, thorough character. The screenwriters tried to make it
a comedy/action film and dishonored Paretsky in their representation of
her character. The screen play should have been written as an
action/thriller along the lines of Patriot Games (1992), an
action/crime like the Italian Job (2003), or a mystery along the lines
of the Thomas Crown affair (1999). All have comedic moments in them and
would be better genres for the V.I. Warshawki novels.<br><br>Maybe if Ms. Turner is up to it she could revive the character or
perhaps Charlize Theron would take a shot at it.

Viewed this movie on 11/20/04, and it was so entertaining that it kept
me up until two in the morning. My wife, who has markedly different
tastes than I do, liked it enough to stay up with me. Imagine my
surprise when I went to Maltin to look up a character, and found it
classed as a BOMB. He panned it as wretchedly scripted, directed and
photographed. To the contrary, I found the script to be easily
followed, something that is getting more and more rare in this age of
obscure scripts. If it was poorly directed, the actors are geniuses,
becaust the scenes hung together well, were understandable and seemed
completely natural, even though the story line was a bit picaresque.
The photography was certainly adequate to tell the story without
intruding on it.<br><br>Maltin and I may have seen different movies, because his plot summary
spoke of a murdered hockey player, and without betraying too much of
the plot, there were plenty of murders but no hockey player in the
movie I saw. The plot in the movie I saw was delightfully complex, with
a number of twists and turns that would have done O'Henry proud. All in
all, it was two hours well spent.

In the 1980's Kathleen Turner was a tremendous star. Several of her
films were huge box-office hits:""Romancing the Stone""(1984), ""Jewel of
the Nile""(1986), ""Peggy Sue Got Married""(Best Actress Oscar
nomination,1986), and ""The War of the Roses""(1989). Critics loved her
in John Huston's ""Prizzi's Honor""(1985) and ""The Accidental
Tourist""(1987). Her sexy voice helped make ""Who Framed Roger
Rabbit""(1988) an enormous blockbuster. And who can forget her
star-making performance that made her quite the sex-symbol in ""Body
Heat""(1981). When ""V.I. Warshawski"" came out Turner was still at her
peak. The huge success of ""War of the Roses"" made her the #1 female
star at US BoxOffices in early 1990. But ""V.I."" opened to disastrous
reviews. She is actually very good in it but the script is so mediocre
and the direction is so flat. She is given nothing to work with but her
vibrant personality and sultry looks keep it together. The film ended
up pulling in only 12 million in the US. This disaster immediately
derailed Turner's career. Male stars like Bruce Willis and Nicolas Cage
can star in one flop after another pulling in huge salaries but it does
not matter as long as they get an occasional blockbuster. But take a
huge Female star like Turner- give her one colossal dud and she is more
or less finished in Hollywood. Turner's career never recovered. A few
more mediocre duds followed then her looks went so now she is stuck in
supporting roles that make it hard to believe she was once among the
greatest of female stars. Maybe she can make a comeback as a star
character actress. WHo knows.

I have just seen Kathleen Turnjer in ""V.I. Warshawski"" for the third
time and, for the third time, am at a total loss to understand the
panning/overall rating of 4.3 awarded to it by previous reviewers. I
think the movie DOES reflect a lot of the Paretsky original novels and
think Turner does a good job in portraying ""the dick from the dock"" in
a manner which combines both respect for the literary character and the
kind of gritty, down-to-earth film noir genre which the film obviously
pays its debts to. This latter aspect is particularly apparent in the
DIALOGUE, much of which my wife and I found hysterical and easily on a
par with such remakes of Chandler as the ""Farewell, My Lovely"" version
of the 1970s with Robert Mitchum and Charlotte Rampling. Like the
letter, ""V.I."" is not going to be rated as ""The Maltese Falcon"" or ""The
Big Sleep"" of the 1990s, but I still think it is a sound, entertaining
and engaging piece of work, which does not deserve the reviews
mentioned above. Now that we are past the ""Blow 'em up / SFX-dominated""
fayre of ""Die Hard 27""or whatever, is it time for a follow-up to what
was, in my view, sadly, Turner's sole donning of the red glitter shoes
of V.I. with another actress in the role?

V.I. Warshawski is my all-time favorite movie, and I don't know why people
keep butchering it so bad. It's an intriguing mystery that pulls you in and
doesn't let you go until the end.<br><br>Kathleen Turner shines as detective Victoria Warshawksi whom is hired by the
13 year old girl, Kat, she is babysitting to find out who murdered her
father. With suspects at every corner, Vic doesn't know who to trust and who
not to. Kat joins forces with Vic in a more helpful approach to the
situation, getting information that Vic can't obtain herself eliminating
suspects and narrowing it down to one. The ending will blow your mind, as it
isn't expected.<br><br>Filmed on Chicago's waterfront, V.I. Warshawski delivers the goods for
intrigue, mystery, and top notch action! If you haven't seen it, give it a
chance. It's worth the 1.99 rental price - don't listen to anyone who says
this movie unbearable to watch because it's an outstanding film and one of
Kathleen Turner's best.

As a native of Chicago, I can't say enough about how beautifully the
city was photographed in this movie. As for the film itself, the story
kept moving at an engaging pace as detective V.I. Warshawski ""follows
the money"" and solves the murder of a former pro hockey player. Turner
is aggressive, sexy, sultry, and vulnerable in this role. Maybe more
street-smart, Chicago toughness in her delivery. The writing, overall,
was adequate. Warshawski's general observations about the stupidity and
gullibility of men tasted to me like watered-down feminism on a piece
of stale, Chicago deep-dish pizza after a while. I wasn't often
convinced that the female detective was a physical threat to the male
villains. The ending with a double-opponent elimination was OK but I
would like to have seen her action skills equal those of Bruce Willis
for true equality to prevail. After all, the key to this action genre
is the ability of the detective to overcome overwhelming physical and
mental opposition. A pleasant, movie-of-the-week kind of yarn, though
better. And that beautiful city!

This movie does have some things going for it; above all, the
performances of Kathleen Turner and Angela Goethals. Turner fits the
profile of her character and is believably tough, sarcastic and funny,
while Goethals is one of the best teen actresses I've seen in a while,
with a sharp timing that matches Turner; those two make an enjoyable
team. And yet something holds the movie back from being anything more
than a passable diversion - maybe it's the plot, which is interesting
for the most part but gets a little too far-fetched at the end (without
spoiling anything, I couldn't easily accept that ""person A"" was so
intent on killing ""person B""), or maybe it's the direction, which
doesn't have enough style and doesn't make much use of the Chicago
locations (apart from a boat chase). It's kind of a shame that this
movie didn't get any sequels - they had the right actress for the part,
all they needed was a better vehicle for her. ** out of 4.

""V.I. Warshawski"" (Kathleen Turner) is a private detective who is hired
by a former hockey player named ""Bernard 'Boom Boom' Grafalk"" (Stephen
Meadows) to investigate some deals involving his two brothers. When her
client is murdered she not only inherits the murder case but
temporarily gets Bernard's 13 year-old daughter ""Kat"" (Angela Goethals)
as well. Throw in a shady mob figure by the name of ""Smeissen"" (Wayne
Knight), a fatherly cop ""Lt. Mallory"" (Charles Durning) and a
two-timing newspaper journalist named ""Murray"" (Jay O. Sanders) and
what develops is a good action movie with plenty of humor along the
way. Now, while this movie certainly has some faults what I liked best
about it was the performance of Kathleen Turner who I thought did quite
well in spite of some weak dialogue and a couple of rather obvious and
predictable scenes. She also had some great legs. In any case, I
enjoyed the movie and I rate it as slightly above average.

I keep thinking the other people who have commented on this movie saw a
different movie than I did.  I totally enjoyed it, Kathleen Turner delivers
a wisecrack better than anyone and her mocking laugh in the bathtub scene
is
too much!  She shows her vulnerable side yet you know that V.I. can take
care of herself when she has to.  The foul mouthed little girl made me
cringe a little with her first words in the movie. The chemistry between
V.I. and the girl works for me.  Randy Edleman's music for the movie really
delivers as well.  My test of a film really centers on the characters. If I
like the characters and care about them that's usually enough. This film
has
a story which is more than I can say for other more popular films.  I would
give it 4 stars out of 5.

            ","

Juwanna Mann follows the story of Jamal Jeffries, the reigning 'bad boy' of basketball, whose undisciplined on-court antics land him out of the league and without any prospects. Financially strapped and untrained in anything but basketball, Jamal comes up with a plan so outrageous it just might work: dress up like a woman and try out for the woman's basketball league. To his surprise, he makes it, but now the real challenge begins - to cease being Jamal and start new life as Juwanna. Matters become even more complicated when Juwanna realizes that he is falling for his teammate Michelle, who shows him that there is more to women than meets the eye.                Written by

You make a movie, and the audience may not see it for another 10 months. Here, you know immediately their reaction.      I am completely and utterly hooked to all the great shows on A&E; and Court TV that are about small town murder. These shows like Forensic Files (1996), City Confidential (1998), I just can\'t get enough of them. It\'s always the same sort of deal. You know that they interview the actual people that lived through the experience. I miss Paul Winfield as the host of City Confidential (1998), may he rest in peace.      (On Bruce Willis) We became good friends during A Few Good Men (1992). He was shooting Death Becomes Her (1992) right next door and, of course, he\'d come over to visit his wife and we started hanging out and have been good friends since. He\'s amazing. One of the things I admire, separate from his work which I\'ve always enjoyed, is that the people he\'s surrounded by are friends he\'s known for 25 years or more. It doesn\'t feel like a posse. It feels like he created his own family at work, which is pretty admirable. When you\'re young and thinking about going into show business your closest friends are the first to say, ""Someday you\'re going to be famous and we\'ll all hang out together"". You say, ""Yeah, yeah"" and it never happens. But I stay in touch with three of my best friends which I\'ve known for 35 years. We make an annual trek to Vegas for the Super Bowl and for those three or four days it\'s heaven on earth. Bruce is unbelievably generous and loyal and a true inspiration in that regard as well. I love working with him. I love being around him. He\'s the party.

As one of the cutting-edge, young stand-ups, he was spotted by major concert promoters, who booked him as the opening act for A-list touring acts, including Patti LaBelle, Kenny G and Luther Vandross. It wasn\'t long before he came to Hollywood and was performing stand-up at a number of clubs, including the Comedy Act Theatre, where he met Robert Townsend. This led to his first national television appearance, with a starring role in Partners in Crime (2005) and was the conduit to Keenen Ivory Wayans, who proved instrumental in Davidson\'s career by offering him an opportunity to audition and join the uniquely talented cast of the most adventurous prime-time variety show of its day, In Living Color (1990). He, Jamie Foxx, Jim Carrey and Damon Wayans made TV history with their originality.Tommy\'s impressive film debut was opposite Halle Berry in Strictly Business (1991). He immediately segued into select high-profile films, starring opposite Jada Pinkett Smith in the romantic comedy, Woo (1998) (New Line), and in the provocative urban comedy, Booty Call (1997) (Columbia Pictures). His credits include numerous feature film roles, from Spike Lee\'s Bamboozled (2000), where he received acclaim and praise for his turn as ""Womack/Sleep \'N Eats"", to Juwanna Mann (2002) (Morgan Creek Productions\') and the pivotal cameo in Jim Carrey\'s Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995), which has become a cult favorite.Davidson\'s hilarious impressions of Sammy Davis Jr., Michael Jackson and other icons have become infamous. His visibility on In Living Color (1990) led to three Showtime specials: ""On Strength of New York"", ""Illin\' in Philly"" and ""Takin\' it to DC"". His elasticity as a performer who delivers on both the big and small screen led to other projects like the lead in the Disney\'s animated series, The Proud Family (2001), and as a host on FOX\'s ""The NFL Show"", alongside football greats Michael Irvin and Tony Siragusa. Davidson also portrays the lead in Will Smith\'s up-and-coming animated series, ""Youngin\'s"" (2000).Tommy stars - along with 80 other star stand-ups - in I Am Comic (2010), opposite Tim Allen, Lewis Black, Sarah Silverman, Carlos Mencia, Jeff Foxworthy and Kathy Griffin. The film, which premiered on Showtime, is one of Netflix\'s surefire hits, enjoying a continual surge as a favorite with consumers. Davidson scored big with reviewers and audiences, alike, opposite Michael Jai White, in the critically-lauded spoof comedy, Black Dynamite (2009) (Sony Pictures), last year\'s big Sundance hit, which is currently being adapted as a cartoon for Adult Swim.He is receiving critical raves for a cameo in Ahmed Ahmed\'s award-winning documentary, Just Like Us (2010), a feature film masterpiece which is a cross-cultural study of stand-up comedy bridging all ethnicities. Tommy travels internationally selling out every venue in which he headlines.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Integrated-PR          Spouse (1)               Amanda Moore          (27 June\xa02015            - present)          Trade Mark (2)        ""Sugar Ray"" Leonard impressions        High-pitched voice and comedic, facial expressionsTrivia (7)      Attended Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School in Bethesda, Maryland.

Queers and peers, feast your eyes on Juwanna Mann, a cliche flick w/ no
surprises, yet intriguing nonetheless. Look, if you're looking for
originality and to be dazzled off your seat, this movie isn't for you. If
you're looking for some genuine laughs, and some of those ""it's so bad,
it's
good"" scenes, then this is the right movie. It's the worth the 10 bucks to
see, but only if you go into the theater with the right attitude. This
movie
is by no means well done nor original, yet it's so cliche at some parts,
and
the characters are so stereotyped, that it will actually make you laugh.
And
yes, there are some genuine comic moments that made me laugh. If you liked
big momma's house, go see this movie.

Juwanna Mann isn't a horrible movie just a by the numbers comedy. The film
has the same jokes that most gender benders comedy's do which get tired
after a while. Miguel A .Nunez does good carrying the movie by himself but
Tommy Davidson and Kim Wayans steal every scene their in. Ginuwine does a
great acting job in his first movie and Mrs.Fox is good as always. While
the
jokes in the gilm are the same overall the film is good and has a nice
message. If Warener had a soundtrack to back the film then it would have
been better but I think with out a SDTK Warner may have a sleeper hit on
their hands.

It had been a long time since I saw this movie. I saw it earlier on TV,
and refreshed my memory. I forgot how funny it was. It has a great
storyline. Miguel A. Núñez, Jr plays Jamal Jeffries, who is a spoiled
basketball star who is soon suspended from the team. After he becomes
desperate, Jamal decides to join the women's basketball team in order
to stay in the game. He disguises himself as a woman and calls himself
'Juwanna Mann' After spending time with them, he begins to fall in love
with one of his teammates, Michelle Langford. The team's biggest game
happens to fall on the day of Jamal's trial and hopes to be reinstated.
Which will he choose? If you love basketball, comedies, and
cross-dressers, you'll love JAWANNA MANN!!!

Despite faint allusions to morals learned from Tootsie, Love &amp; Basketball,
and Mrs. Doubtfire, this low-budget farce is more of a cross between
Sorority Boys and Kazaam without quite capturing the charm of either.  It
doesn't help that Kevin Pollak, the actor with the most accomplished credits
in the movie throws away the obviously golden mold of Sydney Pollack in
Tootsie to allude to playing Jay Mohr in Jerry Maguire but settle for a pale
imitation (to the extent such a thing is possible) of Geoffrey Tambor in the
odious Life Stinks.  I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 because the title star
does make a fairly attractive and physically convincing female athlete when
he's not clowning around.  Of course, it only gets a 2 instead of a
potential 5 or 6 because the film provides NO explanation of how he
overnight became familiar enough with female impersonation techniques to
pull such a good one off so quickly.  <br><br>There are a few laughs in this unpretentious and undemanding brain-dead
comedy, so if you are looking for background noise while you balance your
checkbook or if you have yet to graduate 5th grade, you may find this
acceptable.  Otherwise, skip it.

Watching Juwanna Mann kind of reminded me of the 1993 Mrs. Doubtfire
film about a man dressing as and acting like a woman. The way Miguel A.
Nunez made this person want to play basketball was really hilarious a
amusing. Kevin Pollack as his agent was really a powerful spot since
only he knew the difference between Juwanna and Jamal Jeffries. I liked
the way Jamal told him ""You're a feminine Jerry Maguire"" Vivica Fox was
so hot and perfect as Michele Langsford who at the end did accept Jamal
as well as Juwanna. They should try to shoot more films about men
dressing up as women just like Dustin Hoffman did in Tootsie an Robin
Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire.

In a place far, far away, illegal genetic experiment #626 is detected: Ruthless scientist Dr. Jumba Jookiba has created a strong, intelligent, nearly indestructible and aggressive being with only one known weakness: The high density of his body makes it impossible for the experiment to swim in water.

Wayne\'s World was a worldwide phenom and set the stage for the evil femme fatale Juno Skinner in True Lies (1994), opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger, computer whiz Jingo Asakuma in Rising Sun (1993), opposite Sean Connery, and her own series lead of Sydney Fox on Relic Hunter (1999).Other current television work includes appearing on the 2007 season premiere of FX network\'s Nip/Tuck (2003), on Kelsey Grammer\'s Back to You (2007), recurring as Cha Cha on HBO\'s Curb Your Enthusiasm (2000), and voice work on the Disney series Lilo & Stitch: The Series (2003). Recently, Tia returned to her Hawaiian roots with four Grammy Award-nominated CDs, winning the Grammy Award twice in 2010 and 2012 where she also co-hosted and performed during the ceremony.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Simon Wakelin          Spouse (2) Simon Wakelin (31 December\xa02002            - 12 August\xa02010)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)           Elie Samaha (22 November\xa01992            - 2000)\xa0(divorced)          Trivia (19)      While auditioning for a role on Baywatch (1989) she stalled on returning for the swim test so she could audition for Wayne\'s World (1992).

Sister of Saundra Janairo.Personal Quotes (28)      I kind of fell into acting, but I have sung and trained since I was in the eighth grade.      I love to sing, so I just figured that I was going to sing or something.      I was very young. I thought I knew a lot and I really didn\'t. I trusted the wrong people.      I wanted to be a part of the Disney history.      I slipped at a bus stop; I went one way and my hair went the other. That was the end of my wig.      When I first came here, Hollywood was very closed-minded.      The kids all knew me from Wayne\'s World. The grown-ups knew me after True Lies.      I play a female Indiana Jones, a professor who hunts down precious objects, like a bowl that belonged to the Buddha. They tailored the role to me: I wanted to be smart, funny, and to kick some ass.      I\'m not really this rock \'n\' roll chick.      This is a Disney animated feature; it\'s eternal, it\'s history. What\'s there to think about?      People want me to do the strangest things. They want me to sign their arms or chests.      I can\'t sit on grass without a blanket.      Jason Lee is the most famous actor from Hawaii I can think of.      I act and perform in hopes of getting attention and admiration.      I can\'t stand when people say, ""Don\'t hate me because I\'m beautiful."" Okay, how about I hate you because you said that.      I had been gullible, naive, soft, pliable. That\'s why I got taken advantage of. To survive, you have to have a tough skin.      I\'m concentrating on the positive, on all the wonderful things I\'m doing now.      Beauty lasts five minutes. Maybe longer if you have a good plastic surgeon.      I like theme parks. The fastest roller coaster I\'ve ever been on is at a casino in Nevada.      Doors open because you\'re beautiful, but I wouldn\'t cultivate beauty to the exclusion of brains.      That\'s always at the heart and soul of Disney\'s features, the feeling of a family values.      Having the Stitch character, the villain that becomes a hero, coming from outer space, it took a very difficult and complex story and put it into a simpler, kinder time.      Did you know hemp is a natural fiber?      When I first met my agent, I said, ""If something comes up and it fits my age range and personality, I would like you to send me up for it, even if it specifies blonde or brunette."".      I\'m of Filipino, Spanish and Chinese descent, and was raised on Hawaii.      As an actress, you\'re already disregarded for a lot of the parts by the people who are setting up those shows. You don\'t need your agent to be doing the same.      If there\'s a Disney animated feature based in Hawaii, I knew I had to be part of it. I\'m very proud to be from Hawaii. There was no question the role was mine.      The reporter claimed he was going to write the article from my point of view. Instead, he made me sound like a little idiot.

He later moved to New York, where he studied drama at Juilliard, and joined the Houseman Acting Company at its outset. He often lends his voice to animated films, with Lilo & Stitch (2002) being his 25th theatrically-released Disney animated film. He is also an avid fan of classical music, and has conducted many orchestras, including the Yaquina Chamber Orchestra in Newport, Oregon, where he is the principal guest conductor.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Matt Dicker                    David Ogden Stiers began his career in San Francisco at the Actors\' Workshop and went on to work with John Houseman\'s Acting Company in New York on such productions as The Beggar\'s Opera, Measure for Measure, The Hostage and the hit musical The Magic Show. His other theatre work includes performances with the Committee Revue and Theatre, the California Shakespeare Festival (where he played leads in the classics) and at the Pasadena Playhouse in Love Letters with Meredith Baxter. In addition to his long-running role in M*A*S*H (1972), Stiers\' work on television also includes the mini-series North and South (1985) and North and South, Book II (1986), The First Olympics: Athens 1896 (1984) and roles in such productions as Anatomy of an Illness (1984), The Bad Seed (1985), J.

He is resident conductor of the Newport Symphony Orchestra in Newport, Oregon.      Some of the M*A*S*H (1972) actors jokingly had his dressing room painted orange and purple while Stiers was off for Thanksgiving break.      Was a high school classmate of Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert.      Provided the voice of Cogsworth the clock in Disney\'s Beauty and the Beast (1991). His advice to the Beast on what to give Belle, ""Flowers, chocolates, promises you don\'t intend to keep..."" was his own creation.      Provided several other voices for Disney: Gov. Ratcliffe & Wiggins in Pocahontas (1995) and Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World (1998); Cogsworth and the narrator in Beauty and the Beast (1991); and the Archdeacon in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996).      He is often given small roles in Woody Allen films for which he receives high billing considering his screen time.      On M*A*S*H (1972), he played an Harvard alum and in real life, Stiers taught theater games at Harvard.      Didn\'t learn to drive until 1975, when his role on the Kojak (1973) episode, Kojak: Money Back Guarantee (1975), called for him to be seen driving.      Has a son from a relationship in the 1960s.      Graduated High School at North Eugene High School, Oregon.      Played French horn in the orchestra at Juilliard, which is rather more amusing considering an episode of M*A*S*H (1972) where he bothers Hawkeye and B.J. with persistent bad horn playing.      His last name is pronounced ""styers"".      Best known by the public for his role as Major Charles Winchester on M*A*S*H (1972).      His acting mentor was the late Harry Morgan.      Originally went into audition for the role of Lumiere the Candlestick in Disney\'s Beauty and the Beast (1991). He got the role of Cogsworth the clock instead.      Is the only actor to be a part of both the cast of Beauty and the Beast (1991) and it\'s 1994 Broadway cast. In both he provides the atmospheric narration for the respective prologues.      He appeared in five films directed by Woody Allen: Another Woman (1988), Shadows and Fog (1991), Mighty Aphrodite (1995), Everyone Says I Love You (1996) and The Curse of the Jade Scorpion (2001).Personal Quotes (5)      Why he chose to come out as gay, May, 2009: I could claim noble reasons as coming out in order to move gay rights forward, but I must admit it is for far more selfish reasons. Now is the time I wish to find someone and I do not desire to force any potential partner to live a life of extreme discretion for me.      [on creating the voice of Cogsworth in Beauty and the Beast (1991)] I, at first, imagined a grandfather clock with a deep booming voice. Because he was smaller his vocal chords were also smaller and so the vocal quality became tighter. Then I tried to add a little bit of an uptight, pompous aspect and so that was the voice.      The simple fact of it is, in the British tradition, you\'re an actor who happens to be in a film or on television or on the stage. In America, annoyingly, you\'re identified as a film actor or a TV actor or a whatever actor. Early in my career, I decided to stop paying attention to the labels.      What\'s next is what I really really like to regard. I don\'t care if it\'s voice over work, or commercial, or directing a play, or doing a guest appearance with an orchestra, or going into some sort of ear training for a movie, or what is next. That I keep working just astonishes me. I never take it for granted.      I enjoy working and even though many have this idealistic belief that the entertainment industry and studios like Walt Disney are gay friendly. For the most part they are, but that doesn\'t mean for them that business does not come first. It\'s a matter of economics. Most of my more notable work in the last two decades has been as a voice actor. Certainly, I\'ve done television appearances, be they recurring or guest roles, and numerous motion picture and documentary stints, but a lot of my income has been derived from voicing Disney and family programming. What they might allow in a more known actor, they prefer not having to deal with in minor players.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['Lilo', '""""']","['Stitch', '""Stitch, also known as Experiment 626, is a character from the Disney animated film and franchise, Lilo & Stitch.He is a genetic experiment created by the mad scientist/""evil genius"" Dr. Jumba Jookiba. He is Dr. Jumba\'s 626th experiment.He was created with the purpose of destroying the galaxy. After escaping an intergalactic prison, he steals a spaceship and crash-lands on Earth, specifically on the Hawaiian island of Kauai.There, he is found by a little girl called Lilo Pelekai, who adopts him as his pet. Lilo\'s love and compassion manages to deprogram Stitch, turning him into a good-natured, honest being. However, the captain of the Galactic Federation, Gantu, kidnaps Lilo in an attempt to capture Stitch, prompting him to rescue her. In the end, the leader of the Galactic Federation, the Grand Councilwoman, decides that Stitch may live on Earth, so long as Dr. Jumba and his assigned assistant, Pleakley, keep an eye on him. They decide to move in with Lilo, posing as her aunt and uncle, and they all live as one big family.In Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch, a glitch in Stitch\'s genetic code causes him to have fits that revert him to his original destructive programming. Believing to be ruining his ohana, he tries to flee Earth to prevent further destruction, but at the end Lilo and Dr. Jumba fixes the glitch.In Stitch! The Movie, Dr. Jumba\'s other 625 experiments are scattered across Hawaii, landing in the form of round pods that morph into their original genetic form when they come in contact with water. An evil genius, Dr. Hamsterviel, finds out about this and decides to use the experiments to control the universe. For that purpose, he hires Gantu as his main henchman.Thus, Lilo & Stitch: The Series is about Lilo and Stitch finding the 624 experiments (Experiment 625 was found and taken by Gantu before the events of the series) and using Lilo\'s love and ""ohana"" philosophy to deprogram and name them, as well as keeping Dr. Hamsterviel from getting them first.In Leroy & Stitch, Lilo and Stitch found and deprogrammed all 624 experiments, so Dr. Hamsterviel makes an evil clone of Stitch, Leroy, to help him rule the universe. No longer needing Gantu, he fires him, and Gantu defects to the good guys. In the end, Lilo, Stitch, Gantu and the others defeat Leroy. Finally, Lilo names Experiment 625 as Reuben, and gets him to cooperate with her.Stitch appears in Kingdom Hearts II, as a Summon that players can call to help them in battle.In the anime Stitch!, which takes place several years after Leroy & Stitch, Stitch has returned to Earth after previously fleeing it due to a misconception that Lilo had abandoned him, this time landing on the Okinawa Prefecture in Japan.

Project ""Six-Two-Six"" is deemed too dangerous by the ""Grand Council.""  A
hideous genetic creation from the lab of mad-scientist ""Jumba,"" (David
Ogden
Stiers) project Six-Two-Six is put on board a space ship to be  banished
to
a nice little deserted asteroid, where he can live out the rest of his
days.
On the way there, project Six-Two-Six takes over the ship, and then
escapes
using what looks like a space squad car.  He eventually crash lands on one
of the islands of Hawaii (Kauai?)  where a little five-year old orphan
girl
named ""Lilo"" (Daviegh Chase) finds him in a dog pound (don't ask) and
takes
him home as her new pet dog, ""Stitch"" (Chris Sanders).  Of course the
Grand
Council soon realizes what has happened, and sends agent ""Pleakley"" (Kevin
McDonald) along with the mad-scientist to the island to recapture
experiment
Six-Two-Six.<br><br>And so begins one of the most unusual and creative animated films from the
Disney studios.  Featuring a completely new style of drawing, and
backgrounds that look like watercolor paintings, Disney is taking a bold
step in trying something a little different.  The artwork seems like a
combination of ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" and Saturday morning cartoons.  The
dialogue and slapstick comedy is much more reminiscent of Warner Brother's
beloved ""Loony-Tunes."" Except for a handful of well chosen Elvis Presely
songs, and some beautiful Hawaiian music, there are none of the musical
numbers that one would expect to find in a typical Disney film.  (I, for
one, didn't miss them.)<br><br>We soon find out that Lilo is an orphan, living with her older sister Nani
(Tia Carrere) in what could be comfortably called a ""dysfunctional""
household.  Nani is trying hard to make ends meet and be a mother to her
young sister, who is having a very difficult time adjusting to life
without
her mom and dad.  The creators of the film do a superb job with the
character of Lilo, making you identify with her loneliness and isolation
without making it depressing.  They also very accurately portray the
problems with an older sibling raising a younger, and the friction and
fighting that results is typical of what one would find in this sort of
arrangement.  The subject matter is very mature, but the animators do a
fantastic job bringing it home to a level that small children can
appreciate.<br><br>Nani decides Lilo needs a dog to keep her company, so off to the kennel
they
go.  Lilo just falls in love with Stitch, the ""talking dog,"" and decides
to
take him for a pet.  It is with this most unlikely of characters that Lilo
can find someone to confide in, to share her passions with (like Elvis),
and
to share the pain and sorrow that comes from being without parents.<br><br>Stitch was created by the mad-scientist Jumba to be an evil little
monster,
but in the care of Lilo, he realizes his own aloneness, and his need for
love and acceptance.  So the evil little alien allows Lilo to take him by
the hand, dress him up as Elvis, and go surfing.   (Stitch's one weakness
in
the inability to swim, so for him to go surfing is a surprising concession
to the little girl's whims.)   His original motive for being ""nice"" to
Lilo
was to avoid the agents sent to recapture him, but soon he realizes that
Lilo and Nani mean more to him than just sanctuary.<br><br>Disney makes a point in all their trailers and commercials to show Stitch
as
the Rodney Dangerfield of animated characters: he don't get any respect.
Other than Lilo, everyone else in the film, including his creator Jumba,
is
trying to capture and/or kill him.  Even Lilo's sister finds several
opportunities to take out her frustrations on the mixed-up little alien.
At first, it's rather amusing, since Stitch is about the most obnoxious
Disney character of all time, but after a while, you start feeling sorry
for
the little guy, and start hoping that he can find the love and acceptance
he's longing for.<br><br>I've often wondered why Disney's recent animated films cannot reach the
level that Pixar's CGI creations do effortlessly (""Toy Story,"" ""Monsters
Inc."").  Disney's cartoons seem dull and lifeless compared to the fun and
action that Pixar delivers on a regular basis.   Well, it seems as if the
Disney animators are finally being infected by some of the magic that
comes
from their computer animation partners.   ""Lilo &amp; Stitch"" demonstrates
that
there is still some life left in that old art form that Walt made so
famous
many years ago.
But more importantly, this little gem has a lot of heart.  You find
yourself
caring for the orphaned Lilo, you find yourself hoping that Stitch can fin
d
a place in a family, and you hope that big sister Nani can find a way to
keep social worker ""Mr. Bubbles"" (Ving Rhames) from taking Lilo away to a
foster home.<br><br>There are some really big themes being tackled in this film, such as
unconditional love, the need to belong to a group or community, self
sacrifice, and family unity.   The animators handles all these extremely
well, and you find yourself getting a lesson in philosophy as well as
being
entertained.   Yet the one theme that Disney pushes in all their
advertising, and several times during the course of the film, is the oft
repeated phrase: ""Ohana means family, and family means NO ONE gets left
behind.""  This is a theme one finds emphasized in the recent combat films
""Black Hawk Down"" and ""We Were Soldiers,"" but isn't something you often
find
in a animated feature!  That one little phrase, ""no one gets left behind,""
has enough philosophical and theological weight to fill a college text
book.
It means that everyone, no matter what you may think of them, has value,
and that there is no such thing an ""expendable"" person.    A better lesson
for young children would be difficult to find.<br><br>My rating: 10/10.

""Lilo &amp; Stitch"" tells the touching story of a lonely little Hawaiian
girl, named Lilo, who meets and befriends Stitch, an escaped refugee
alien who poses as a dog at the pound. <br><br>I wasn't expecting much when it first came out, not being to interested
in it. Well, after seeing it at the theater, I can now say it is
Disney's best film. Ever. It's better than classics like ""Beauty and
the Beast"" and ""The Little Mermaid,"" both of which I adore. Many will
not feel the same way as I do but I thought ""Lilo &amp; Stitch"" was one of
Disney's most inventive and involving scripts with fleshed-out and
well-written characters.<br><br>We are set in Hawaii, a tropical background that gives the movie a
great feel. Setting it in Kansas, as originally planned, would not have
had the same effect. The animation is simply beautiful, with pink
fluffy clouds and wonderfully drawn characters. <br><br>However, it's the story that ""Lilo &amp; Stitch"" tells, along with many
other great elements, that makes this film so outstanding. Not only is
the film very funny (in fact, it's hilarious!) with pure moments of
comic genius that can appeal to older audiences as well as kids, it's
one of the most touching films I have ever seen. The whole middle of
the movie is one that gives us spectacular scenes in a row that move me
to tears each time.<br><br>***SKIP THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH, TO AVOID MILD SPOILERS***<br><br>I don't wanna say too much, but Nani's fight for custody of Lilo,
tossed in with Stitch's touching character arc and search for the one
place he does belong, and Lilo's loneliness, and a broken family, and
cherished and beloved friendship with Stitch make this movie a
surprisingly heartwarming and touching feature. One of the film's
strengths is that it can be, at times, so sad.<br><br>***END SPOILERS***<br><br>The direction is solid, as is the animation. The water, and backdrop of
Hawaii is desirable. The characters are developed, unlike most Disney
classics, and lovable. You can identify with these characters and feel
for them, and yes, Stitch does qualify in that category. His battered
emotions, as well as the also adorable Lilo, are part of what makes
this film so moving. This is an original, funny, and extremely
heartwarming film that I highly recommend to families.<br><br>""Lilo &amp; Stitch"" was wonderful characters that I instantly fell in love
with. More captivating than previous, sub-par Disney releases such as
""Hercules,"" ""Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" or ""Tarzan,"" this movie makes me
laugh, cry, and moves me immensely. While it didn't break any new
ground or anything, it thankfully returned audiences back to Disney's
roots in terms of quality.<br><br>10/10

I was disappointed with the comments of a previous reviewer called
ebayanderson concerning this movie as I feel that he/she is not living
in the real world. Lilo and Stitch is one of my favourite Disney movies
as it covers so many topics and covers them well. Firstly, concerning
Lilo's feeding the fish, well, all kids have little quirks and this is
obviously meant to be her's. As for Nani being a care giver, well,
she's supposed to be in her teens, dealing with her parents's loss as
well as dealing with her sister's and taking care of the little girl
under the pressure of keeping her family together, finding work etc.
and it was nice as my 14 year old daughter pointed out, that Nani was
like a real woman, with her little pot belly and not very stick thin
build, for me she is a great character for little girls who have to put
up with cartoon females such as the impossibly(pardon the pun)thin Kim
Possible, which is sadly also a Disney cartoon girl. Actually, I tend
not to look too deeply into movies unless they are there to make us do
so, e.g Schindler's List, but, this movie covered some subjects that I
am familiar with, a young child losing it's parents and it dealt with
them well. The scene where Stitch takes the bicycle, well, how could
anyone feel sorry for the little girl considering she is the monstrous
brat in the movie. Anyway, I love the movie and I've watched it many
times and am a hand on heart Stitch fan. Chris Sanders came up with an
awesome character and he and Dean DuBlois did an excellent job in
bringing him to life. they managed to make a movie that touched your
heart with out being sickly or distressing a la Bambi. 10 out of 10

""Lilo &amp; Stitch"" is unusual for a Disney animated movie in that it actually
seems to take place in the real world (not to mention the present day),
despite the latter half of the title being a genetic creation from another
galaxy. Devoid of almost everything that people come to expect when the name
""Walt Disney Pictures"" appears on screen - which is not to say we're in
""Golgo 13"" territory here - this, as did ""The Emperor's New Groove,""
suggests that though the box office takings may go down, the House of Mouse
may yet pull another ""Beauty and the Beast"" on us one day.<br><br>The movie's a breath of fresh air not only in its setting - it's set on the
Hawaiian island of Kauai - but also in its characters; Lilo is a little girl
being brought up by her big sister Nani following their parents' death
(offscreen), and the movie's not afraid to indicate that it's tough for both
of them. They, along with their social worker Cobra Bubbles and friend
David, constitute a rare sighting of proper human beings in Disney cartoons
(see also, surprisingly, Lucky Piquel from ""Bonkers""), the reward
writer-directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois get for putting the emphasis
on the emotions rather than on the chase element of the plot
(Stitch/Experiment 626 was created by a scientist in violation of the laws
of his planet; when Stitch escaped, his creator and an ""E-arth"" expert were
sent to bring him back) or on the potential for slapstick - though it's
there and it's certainly used, the focus is purely on heart.<br><br>The realness of the movie means that ""Lilo &amp; Stitch"" often feels like a live
action movie that just happens to be drawn (at one point Stitch sees a 1950s
SF movie on TV, and the movie in question is shown as a genuine film clip).
Usually that's a bad thing if the 'toon in question strives to be realistic,

Yes, it's a sad fact that Disney, the family favourite for close to a
century, have fallen into decline. All the same, it annoys me no end
when people go on about how 'The Lion King' of 1994 was the last truly
great film that the company produced, because, in their period of
decline and lack of success, the House of Mouse still surprised us all
by churning out one cracking exception - the sassy and heartwarming
'Lilo and Stitch'.<br><br>In the Stitch of the title (and face it, he may have shared his title
logo with Lilo but Stitch has always been the undisputed star of this
empire) it really feels like Disney have found that very likable and
very different kind of hero to break them out of their rut. To begin
with at least, he has none of the noble or high moral qualities that
Disney usually attributes to its lead characters. And the circumstances
in which he comes about are, for a family film, startling - the result
of an illegal extra-terrestrial experiment to produce a creature that
is both destructive and indestructible. When Stitch finds himself
seized by the Intergalactic Council to be punished for his inbuilt
wickedness, he escapes - it wouldn't be much of a movie if he didn't -
and flees to planet Earth, with the alien authorities in hot pursuit.
Though the film's anarchic spirit owes a fair bit more to 80s creature
films like 'Gremlins' and 'Critters', I suppose you could look at it as
a inversion on the plot of 'ET', in which, this time round, the humans
are harmless and it's his fellow aliens who pose greater threat to
Stitch.<br><br>Finding himself stranded on Hawaii, our little anti-hero has no choice
but to disguise himself as a dog and take refuge with Lilo. Lilo being
a lonely young orphan living with her older sister Nani, and who may be
taken away in a matter of days if Nani doesn't prove herself to be a
more responsible guardian. The merging of these two very troubling
story lines shows a lot of tenaciousness on Disney's part and in the
end they produce a film that is fun and funky enough for the younger
audiences, but also heartwrenching enough to touch even the most
cynical of adults. It's also helped by a good line secondary
characters, the most successful of which are Jumba and Cobra Bubbles,
because, like Stitch, they're unconventional in the roles they fulfil.
Jumba is an evil genius with a heart. Bubbles is a social worker who,
fittingly since he's voiced by Ving Rhames, looks like he walked
straight out of 'Pulp Fiction'.<br><br>It ain't perfect though. Considering that Stitch is one of Disney's
most engaging heroes, it really blows that Gantu should have to be one
of the stuido's flatter villains. He isn't drawn very well and he isn't
developed as a character much further than being ruthless and
bad-tempered. There is also one pretty big plot-hole that older viewers
may be troubled by - if that lady at the pound really thought that
Stitch was dead, why did she put him in with the dogs? And wasn't she
alarmed by his six legs and his antennae?<br><br>It may be flawed, but in the end it's the merits that triumph. And it's
a good example of just how dazzling 2D animation can be when given the
right attention to detail. Once you get past the pretty pale opening
scenes in outer space and enter the world that Lilo inhabits, visually
this is beautiful stuff, employing the technique of watercolour
backgrounds for the first time in decades. And the soundtrack too is
one of the most memorable in Disney's canon. I believe this is the
first time they've based its score around the pre-existing songs of a
familiar artist - in this case the immortal Elvis Presley. Needless to
say, it's great music.<br><br>(Sadly, we also had to tolerate the likes of Gareth Gates and A Teens
doing sugary covers over the end credits, but at this stage you can
always switch off or leave the cinema.)<br><br>Too bad that Disney are now really on the wane, or they could have
tried doing these themed soundtracks more often with the Beatles and
Pink Floyd...oh well, I can dream.<br><br>To sum up, Stitch is the best. Watch him.<br><br>Grade: A-

I don't know why this film didn't do better at the box office. This is
perhaps Disney's best animated film to date. It rivals anything by
Pixar. Why? Very simple really and it's what Pixar keeps doing so well.
They tell a good story filled with well developed characters. Not to
mention the animation is excellent and the watercolor backgrounds
beautiful. Watch it a second or third time just to look at these
fantastic pieces of art! I hope Disney learns a lesson here (from DVD
sales at least) that 2-D animation isn't dead if done right and Lilo &amp;
Stitch was done right. I purchased the DVD for my daughter, okay, for
me too but she loves it and while only almost four, she gets the
themes. (although it took her a while to understand Nani is Lilo's
sister and not her mother). The special features are good. The Hawiian
Children's Choir and Hula segments especially good. I liked the deleted
scene feature and would like to see them added for a later release.
Disney should have marketed this film better. I would have liked to
have seen it on the big screen. Personally, I don't care for Disney as
a company but if they keep producing work like this, I'll keep coming
back.

This was a pretty entertaining ""kids"" animated film. It was a little
different in that there is some dramatic action you usually don't see
in nice animated cartoons and you have heroes who aren't exactly good
role models. However, as the film progresses, all those characters
(small child, big sister and alien) all become nicer and more caring
""people."" There also is a good ""no one is left behind"" family message.
You just have to be patient with the human kid and sister in the
beginning.<br><br>I think the best feature of this film are the brilliant colors. This is
a great visual movie. It's also nice to hear a kids movie these days
with absolutely no profanity in it. (What a sad statement to have to
make.)<br><br>In summary: one of the better modern-day animated films. Highly
recommended.

First time, I commented how ""The Emperor's New Groove"" was my favorite
Disney movie of the last ten years, and how ""Lilo &amp; Stitch"" had left me
wanting for more.<br><br>How wrong I was then.<br><br>I gave it another chance. I went back to watch it with a couple of friends
and their sons and daughters. What best atmosphere to enjoy a Disney
flick?<br><br>And then, the scene were Stitch is alone, with ""The Ugly Duckling"" book,
shouting ""I'm lost!"" (or at least that's what he was saying in spanish) made
me change my mind. I suddenly became very identified with the main
character's quest for belonging, and suddenly realized he was actually
everyone I know - searching for approval, trying to be loved, longing for
love. The watercolor drawings, the facial expression, the music, the mood -
perfection, indeed. There are a couple of animated scenes that convey this
kind of mood - the Ballroom Sequence in ""Beauty and the Beast"", Simba's dad
being killed in ""The Lion King"", Jessie's song in ""Toy Story 2"" - and this
one is one of the best I've ever seen. Such simplicity and beauty is strange
to find.<br><br>When we walked out of the movie, my friend's kids were talking excitedly
about the movie, when one of their mothers asked them what they enjoyed most
about the movie. And one of the girls exclaimed ""Ohana means family! And
your family never forgets or abandons you!"" (that's what is said in the
spanish version of the movie).<br><br>Then I suddenly realized we need more movies like this.<br><br>Solid 9 / 10 for Lilo &amp; Stitch.

Disney's animation department (until the purchase of Pixar) had, to
tell the truth, fallen into a bit of a dark age as the 90s drew to a
close. The films were getting muddled with executive desires, and as a
result went ridiculously over budget, and needless to say ultimately
often bombing at the box office and/or with critics as a consequence.
Only the Pixar films and, to a lesser extent, DTV sequels (themselves
not exactly the brightest bulbs in the chandelier) were really the only
new animated films from Disney that were making money. Whilst a number
of Disney's animated films of the early 2000s are fine (""Home on the
Range"" and ""Brother Bear"" are, in particular, both fun flicks), they
certainly don't quite live up to the best of Disney animation.<br><br>And then there's ""Chicken Little"". I wanted to like it, but I was left
really disappointed. It had nice animation, but executive meddling had
left the story in a mess. I'm a fan of Zach Braff and Harry Shearer,
but even their vocal talents didn't save this film, which resulted in
the worst Disney film of all time, and was probably only a hit due to
the sheer mountain of advertising.<br><br>And yet, there's always an oasis in the middle of a desert, and ""Lilo
and Stitch"" is, in this case, just that. It's the story of a girl who
mistakes an alien for a dog, and whilst seeming an unusual little
flick, is unpretentious. The animation differs from the classic Disney
style that many may be used to, but it's delicious eye candy. It's
rather touching, too and was rightfully a hit with critics and at the
box office. Director Chris Sanders is directing another animated film
for Disney entitled ""American Dog"" and should be released in 2008.
Hopefully that will be just as good.<br><br>Although it was rated PG in the USA, I honestly think that most young
kids will be able to take this if they survived the likes of ""The Lion
King"", ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Dumbo"". But enough with the kids, and onto
the adults; seriously, don't dub this as a kids movie because it's made
by Disney. It's got something for everybody in it and I recommend it.

This is a great little movie.  It has the right mix of comedy, drama, and
tear-jerking.  The characters are interesting and very well done.  The
animation is high quality.  The setting is fairly unique.  I have to say,
Disney's animation people can do something besides make bad sequels after
all.

Project ""Six-Two-Six"" is deemed too dangerous by the ""Grand Council.""  A
hideous genetic creation from the lab of mad-scientist ""Jumba,"" (David
Ogden
Stiers) project Six-Two-Six is put on board a space ship to be  banished
to
a nice little deserted asteroid, where he can live out the rest of his
days.
On the way there, project Six-Two-Six takes over the ship, and then
escapes
using what looks like a space squad car.  He eventually crash lands on one
of the islands of Hawaii (Kauai?)  where a little five-year old orphan
girl
named ""Lilo"" (Daviegh Chase) finds him in a dog pound (don't ask) and
takes
him home as her new pet dog, ""Stitch"" (Chris Sanders).  Of course the
Grand
Council soon realizes what has happened, and sends agent ""Pleakley"" (Kevin
McDonald) along with the mad-scientist to the island to recapture
experiment
Six-Two-Six.<br><br>And so begins one of the most unusual and creative animated films from the
Disney studios.  Featuring a completely new style of drawing, and
backgrounds that look like watercolor paintings, Disney is taking a bold
step in trying something a little different.  The artwork seems like a
combination of ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" and Saturday morning cartoons.  The
dialogue and slapstick comedy is much more reminiscent of Warner Brother's
beloved ""Loony-Tunes."" Except for a handful of well chosen Elvis Presely
songs, and some beautiful Hawaiian music, there are none of the musical
numbers that one would expect to find in a typical Disney film.  (I, for
one, didn't miss them.)<br><br>We soon find out that Lilo is an orphan, living with her older sister Nani
(Tia Carrere) in what could be comfortably called a ""dysfunctional""
household.  Nani is trying hard to make ends meet and be a mother to her
young sister, who is having a very difficult time adjusting to life
without
her mom and dad.  The creators of the film do a superb job with the
character of Lilo, making you identify with her loneliness and isolation
without making it depressing.  They also very accurately portray the
problems with an older sibling raising a younger, and the friction and
fighting that results is typical of what one would find in this sort of
arrangement.  The subject matter is very mature, but the animators do a
fantastic job bringing it home to a level that small children can
appreciate.<br><br>Nani decides Lilo needs a dog to keep her company, so off to the kennel
they
go.  Lilo just falls in love with Stitch, the ""talking dog,"" and decides
to
take him for a pet.  It is with this most unlikely of characters that Lilo
can find someone to confide in, to share her passions with (like Elvis),
and
to share the pain and sorrow that comes from being without parents.<br><br>Stitch was created by the mad-scientist Jumba to be an evil little
monster,
but in the care of Lilo, he realizes his own aloneness, and his need for
love and acceptance.  So the evil little alien allows Lilo to take him by
the hand, dress him up as Elvis, and go surfing.   (Stitch's one weakness
in
the inability to swim, so for him to go surfing is a surprising concession
to the little girl's whims.)   His original motive for being ""nice"" to
Lilo
was to avoid the agents sent to recapture him, but soon he realizes that
Lilo and Nani mean more to him than just sanctuary.<br><br>Disney makes a point in all their trailers and commercials to show Stitch
as
the Rodney Dangerfield of animated characters: he don't get any respect.
Other than Lilo, everyone else in the film, including his creator Jumba,
is
trying to capture and/or kill him.  Even Lilo's sister finds several
opportunities to take out her frustrations on the mixed-up little alien.
At first, it's rather amusing, since Stitch is about the most obnoxious
Disney character of all time, but after a while, you start feeling sorry
for
the little guy, and start hoping that he can find the love and acceptance
he's longing for.<br><br>I've often wondered why Disney's recent animated films cannot reach the
level that Pixar's CGI creations do effortlessly (""Toy Story,"" ""Monsters
Inc."").  Disney's cartoons seem dull and lifeless compared to the fun and
action that Pixar delivers on a regular basis.   Well, it seems as if the
Disney animators are finally being infected by some of the magic that
comes
from their computer animation partners.   ""Lilo &amp; Stitch"" demonstrates
that
there is still some life left in that old art form that Walt made so
famous
many years ago.
But more importantly, this little gem has a lot of heart.  You find
yourself
caring for the orphaned Lilo, you find yourself hoping that Stitch can fin
d
a place in a family, and you hope that big sister Nani can find a way to
keep social worker ""Mr. Bubbles"" (Ving Rhames) from taking Lilo away to a
foster home.<br><br>There are some really big themes being tackled in this film, such as
unconditional love, the need to belong to a group or community, self
sacrifice, and family unity.   The animators handles all these extremely
well, and you find yourself getting a lesson in philosophy as well as
being
entertained.   Yet the one theme that Disney pushes in all their
advertising, and several times during the course of the film, is the oft
repeated phrase: ""Ohana means family, and family means NO ONE gets left
behind.""  This is a theme one finds emphasized in the recent combat films
""Black Hawk Down"" and ""We Were Soldiers,"" but isn't something you often
find
in a animated feature!  That one little phrase, ""no one gets left behind,""
has enough philosophical and theological weight to fill a college text
book.
It means that everyone, no matter what you may think of them, has value,
and that there is no such thing an ""expendable"" person.    A better lesson
for young children would be difficult to find.<br><br>My rating: 10/10.

""Lilo &amp; Stitch"" tells the touching story of a lonely little Hawaiian
girl, named Lilo, who meets and befriends Stitch, an escaped refugee
alien who poses as a dog at the pound. <br><br>I wasn't expecting much when it first came out, not being to interested
in it. Well, after seeing it at the theater, I can now say it is
Disney's best film. Ever. It's better than classics like ""Beauty and
the Beast"" and ""The Little Mermaid,"" both of which I adore. Many will
not feel the same way as I do but I thought ""Lilo &amp; Stitch"" was one of
Disney's most inventive and involving scripts with fleshed-out and
well-written characters.<br><br>We are set in Hawaii, a tropical background that gives the movie a
great feel. Setting it in Kansas, as originally planned, would not have
had the same effect. The animation is simply beautiful, with pink
fluffy clouds and wonderfully drawn characters. <br><br>However, it's the story that ""Lilo &amp; Stitch"" tells, along with many
other great elements, that makes this film so outstanding. Not only is
the film very funny (in fact, it's hilarious!) with pure moments of
comic genius that can appeal to older audiences as well as kids, it's
one of the most touching films I have ever seen. The whole middle of
the movie is one that gives us spectacular scenes in a row that move me
to tears each time.<br><br>***SKIP THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH, TO AVOID MILD SPOILERS***<br><br>I don't wanna say too much, but Nani's fight for custody of Lilo,
tossed in with Stitch's touching character arc and search for the one
place he does belong, and Lilo's loneliness, and a broken family, and
cherished and beloved friendship with Stitch make this movie a
surprisingly heartwarming and touching feature. One of the film's
strengths is that it can be, at times, so sad.<br><br>***END SPOILERS***<br><br>The direction is solid, as is the animation. The water, and backdrop of
Hawaii is desirable. The characters are developed, unlike most Disney
classics, and lovable. You can identify with these characters and feel
for them, and yes, Stitch does qualify in that category. His battered
emotions, as well as the also adorable Lilo, are part of what makes
this film so moving. This is an original, funny, and extremely
heartwarming film that I highly recommend to families.<br><br>""Lilo &amp; Stitch"" was wonderful characters that I instantly fell in love
with. More captivating than previous, sub-par Disney releases such as
""Hercules,"" ""Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" or ""Tarzan,"" this movie makes me
laugh, cry, and moves me immensely. While it didn't break any new
ground or anything, it thankfully returned audiences back to Disney's
roots in terms of quality.<br><br>10/10

I was disappointed with the comments of a previous reviewer called
ebayanderson concerning this movie as I feel that he/she is not living
in the real world. Lilo and Stitch is one of my favourite Disney movies
as it covers so many topics and covers them well. Firstly, concerning
Lilo's feeding the fish, well, all kids have little quirks and this is
obviously meant to be her's. As for Nani being a care giver, well,
she's supposed to be in her teens, dealing with her parents's loss as
well as dealing with her sister's and taking care of the little girl
under the pressure of keeping her family together, finding work etc.
and it was nice as my 14 year old daughter pointed out, that Nani was
like a real woman, with her little pot belly and not very stick thin
build, for me she is a great character for little girls who have to put
up with cartoon females such as the impossibly(pardon the pun)thin Kim
Possible, which is sadly also a Disney cartoon girl. Actually, I tend
not to look too deeply into movies unless they are there to make us do
so, e.g Schindler's List, but, this movie covered some subjects that I
am familiar with, a young child losing it's parents and it dealt with
them well. The scene where Stitch takes the bicycle, well, how could
anyone feel sorry for the little girl considering she is the monstrous
brat in the movie. Anyway, I love the movie and I've watched it many
times and am a hand on heart Stitch fan. Chris Sanders came up with an
awesome character and he and Dean DuBlois did an excellent job in
bringing him to life. they managed to make a movie that touched your
heart with out being sickly or distressing a la Bambi. 10 out of 10

""Lilo &amp; Stitch"" is unusual for a Disney animated movie in that it actually
seems to take place in the real world (not to mention the present day),
despite the latter half of the title being a genetic creation from another
galaxy. Devoid of almost everything that people come to expect when the name
""Walt Disney Pictures"" appears on screen - which is not to say we're in
""Golgo 13"" territory here - this, as did ""The Emperor's New Groove,""
suggests that though the box office takings may go down, the House of Mouse
may yet pull another ""Beauty and the Beast"" on us one day.<br><br>The movie's a breath of fresh air not only in its setting - it's set on the
Hawaiian island of Kauai - but also in its characters; Lilo is a little girl
being brought up by her big sister Nani following their parents' death
(offscreen), and the movie's not afraid to indicate that it's tough for both
of them. They, along with their social worker Cobra Bubbles and friend
David, constitute a rare sighting of proper human beings in Disney cartoons
(see also, surprisingly, Lucky Piquel from ""Bonkers""), the reward
writer-directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois get for putting the emphasis
on the emotions rather than on the chase element of the plot
(Stitch/Experiment 626 was created by a scientist in violation of the laws
of his planet; when Stitch escaped, his creator and an ""E-arth"" expert were
sent to bring him back) or on the potential for slapstick - though it's
there and it's certainly used, the focus is purely on heart.<br><br>The realness of the movie means that ""Lilo &amp; Stitch"" often feels like a live
action movie that just happens to be drawn (at one point Stitch sees a 1950s
SF movie on TV, and the movie in question is shown as a genuine film clip).
Usually that's a bad thing if the 'toon in question strives to be realistic,
but in this case there are so many elements that don't come naturally - seen
any koala/dog hybrid-Elvis Presley wannabes on the beach lately? - that it
still works. If there's a downside, it's that the scenes of the alien
pursuers are for the most part almost a distraction... but even then the
human element ups the involvement, with the added bonus of there being no
real ""bad guys"" per se (yes, I said bonus - it's nice to see a Disney movie
where there isn't a traditional black-hatted villain, just people doing
their jobs).<br><br>And if all else fails, take into consideration the fact that it's also often
genuinely funny; the fact that it never condescends to its audience; the
fact that you actually have real Hawaiians (the voices of Tia Carrere and

Stitch was done right. I purchased the DVD for my daughter, okay, for
me too but she loves it and while only almost four, she gets the
themes. (although it took her a while to understand Nani is Lilo's
sister and not her mother). The special features are good. The Hawiian
Children's Choir and Hula segments especially good. I liked the deleted
scene feature and would like to see them added for a later release.
Disney should have marketed this film better. I would have liked to
have seen it on the big screen. Personally, I don't care for Disney as
a company but if they keep producing work like this, I'll keep coming
back.

This was a pretty entertaining ""kids"" animated film. It was a little
different in that there is some dramatic action you usually don't see
in nice animated cartoons and you have heroes who aren't exactly good
role models. However, as the film progresses, all those characters
(small child, big sister and alien) all become nicer and more caring
""people."" There also is a good ""no one is left behind"" family message.
You just have to be patient with the human kid and sister in the
beginning.<br><br>I think the best feature of this film are the brilliant colors. This is
a great visual movie. It's also nice to hear a kids movie these days
with absolutely no profanity in it. (What a sad statement to have to
make.)<br><br>In summary: one of the better modern-day animated films. Highly
recommended.

First time, I commented how ""The Emperor's New Groove"" was my favorite
Disney movie of the last ten years, and how ""Lilo &amp; Stitch"" had left me
wanting for more.<br><br>How wrong I was then.<br><br>I gave it another chance. I went back to watch it with a couple of friends
and their sons and daughters. What best atmosphere to enjoy a Disney
flick?<br><br>And then, the scene were Stitch is alone, with ""The Ugly Duckling"" book,
shouting ""I'm lost!"" (or at least that's what he was saying in spanish) made
me change my mind. I suddenly became very identified with the main
character's quest for belonging, and suddenly realized he was actually
everyone I know - searching for approval, trying to be loved, longing for
love. The watercolor drawings, the facial expression, the music, the mood -
perfection, indeed. There are a couple of animated scenes that convey this
kind of mood - the Ballroom Sequence in ""Beauty and the Beast"", Simba's dad
being killed in ""The Lion King"", Jessie's song in ""Toy Story 2"" - and this
one is one of the best I've ever seen. Such simplicity and beauty is strange
to find.<br><br>When we walked out of the movie, my friend's kids were talking excitedly
about the movie, when one of their mothers asked them what they enjoyed most
about the movie. And one of the girls exclaimed ""Ohana means family! And
your family never forgets or abandons you!"" (that's what is said in the
spanish version of the movie).<br><br>Then I suddenly realized we need more movies like this.<br><br>Solid 9 / 10 for Lilo &amp; Stitch.

Disney's animation department (until the purchase of Pixar) had, to
tell the truth, fallen into a bit of a dark age as the 90s drew to a
close. The films were getting muddled with executive desires, and as a
result went ridiculously over budget, and needless to say ultimately
often bombing at the box office and/or with critics as a consequence.
Only the Pixar films and, to a lesser extent, DTV sequels (themselves
not exactly the brightest bulbs in the chandelier) were really the only
new animated films from Disney that were making money. Whilst a number
of Disney's animated films of the early 2000s are fine (""Home on the
Range"" and ""Brother Bear"" are, in particular, both fun flicks), they
certainly don't quite live up to the best of Disney animation.<br><br>And then there's ""Chicken Little"". I wanted to like it, but I was left
really disappointed. It had nice animation, but executive meddling had
left the story in a mess. I'm a fan of Zach Braff and Harry Shearer,
but even their vocal talents didn't save this film, which resulted in
the worst Disney film of all time, and was probably only a hit due to
the sheer mountain of advertising.<br><br>And yet, there's always an oasis in the middle of a desert, and ""Lilo
and Stitch"" is, in this case, just that. It's the story of a girl who
mistakes an alien for a dog, and whilst seeming an unusual little
flick, is unpretentious. The animation differs from the classic Disney
style that many may be used to, but it's delicious eye candy. It's
rather touching, too and was rightfully a hit with critics and at the
box office. Director Chris Sanders is directing another animated film
for Disney entitled ""American Dog"" and should be released in 2008.
Hopefully that will be just as good.<br><br>Although it was rated PG in the USA, I honestly think that most young
kids will be able to take this if they survived the likes of ""The Lion
King"", ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Dumbo"". But enough with the kids, and onto
the adults; seriously, don't dub this as a kids movie because it's made
by Disney. It's got something for everybody in it and I recommend it.

This is a great little movie.  It has the right mix of comedy, drama, and
tear-jerking.  The characters are interesting and very well done.  The
animation is high quality.  The setting is fairly unique.  I have to say,
Disney's animation people can do something besides make bad sequels after
all.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt181689/?,Minority Report (2002) ,7.7,"
                    In a future where a special police unit is able to arrest murderers before they commit their crimes, an officer from that unit is himself accused of a future murder.
            ","

In the year 2054 A.D. crime is virtually eliminated from Washington D.C. thanks to an elite law enforcing squad ""Precrime"". They use three gifted humans (called ""Pre-Cogs"") with special powers to see into the future and predict crimes beforehand. John Anderton heads Precrime and believes the system's flawlessness steadfastly. However one day the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton will commit a murder himself in the next 36 hours. Worse, Anderton doesn't even know the victim. He decides to get to the mystery's core by finding out the 'minority report' which means the prediction of the female Pre-Cog Agatha that ""might"" tell a different story and prove Anderton innocent.

Nonetheless, this sensitive, deeply religious youngster who was born in 1962 in Syracuse, New York, was destined to become one of the highest paid and most sought after actors in screen history.Tom is the only son (among four children) of nomadic parents, Mary Lee (Pfeiffer), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III, an electrical engineer. His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and he has German, Irish, and English ancestry. Young Tom spent his boyhood always on the move, and by the time he was 14 he had attended 15 different schools in the U.S. and Canada. He finally settled in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, with his mother and her new husband. While in high school, he developed an interest in acting and abandoned his plans of becoming a priest, dropped out of school, and at age 18 headed for New York and a possible acting career. The next 15 years of his life are the stuff of legends. He made his film debut with a small part in Endless Love (1981) and from the outset exhibited an undeniable box office appeal to both male and female audiences.Though below average height and not particularly handsome in the traditional sense, within 5 years Tom Cruise was starring in some of the top grossing films of the 1980s including Top Gun (1986); The Color of Money (1986), Rain Man (1988) and Born on the Fourth of July (1989). By the 1990s he was one of the highest paid actors in the world earning an average 15 million dollars a picture in such blockbuster hits as Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994), Mission: Impossible (1996) and Jerry Maguire (1996) for which he received an Academy Award Nomination for best actor. In 1990 he renounced his devout Catholic beliefs and embraced The Church Of Scientology claiming that Scientology teachings had cured him of the dyslexia that had plagued him all of his life. A kind and thoughtful man well known for his compassion and generosity, Tom Cruise is one of the best liked members of the movie community. He was married to actress Nicole Kidman until 2001.

While he was working with Paul Newman in the The Color of Money (1986), he engaged in much conversation with the politically active actor. The resulting conscious raising changed him from an actor who ignored the jingoistic tone of Top Gun (1986) to a performer who chose a film with a strong anti-war tone, Born on the Fourth of July (1989) to counter his contribution to the former film.

[2006]      (August 22, 2006) Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone announced through the ""Wall Street Journal"" that Viacom\' Paramount subsidiary was terminating its development deal with Cruise after 14 years. Redstone said the firm terminated its deal with Cruise due to the under-performance of Mission: Impossible III (2006) (which had been expected to gross $100-150 million more than it did), which he attributed to Cruise\'s ""bad behavior"". Movie pundits were somewhat surprised by the announcement, as Cruise remains the top box office draw in North America and was Paramount\'s cash cow. Cruise\'s films reportedly have accounted for 32% of Paramount Pictures\' revenues in the last six years, and he was named the Top Box Office draw for a record seventh time by Quigley Publications for the year 2005. As part of its machinations before severing its connections with Cruise, Paramount leaked to the press the information that the deal was worth $10 million annually; however, the development deal actually was for $3 million per annum. At the time of the announcement, Cruise and his advisers were considering Paramount\'s new offer of $2 million per year in development money when Redstone dropped this bombshell. The news gave rise to speculation that Paramount has run out of cash as it reportedly has told other development partners with which it has deals to use their own cash for the rest of the year, with the proviso they will be reimbursed come 2007.

He did not get the role, but the director, Paul Newman remembered him, and decided that he wanted Cruise for The Color of Money (1986).      His acting idol is Paul Newman. Much to the delight of Cruise, they became good friends during work on The Color of Money (1986). Newman got him into racing, and Cruise ultimately raced on his team.      He became good friends with Sean Penn and Timothy Hutton during the making of Taps (1981).      Nine actors so far have got an Oscar nomination for their role in a movie co-starring Tom Cruise. Paul Newman, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Dustin Hoffman, Jack Nicholson, Holly Hunter, Cuba Gooding Jr., Ken Watanabe, Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr..      From late January to early February 2009, he along with wife, Katie Holmes and daughter, Suri, spent several days in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil staying at the famous Copacabana Palace Hotel. They were in town for a vacation (which included a helicopter tour over Rio) as well as to promote his film Valkyrie (2008).      On January 25, 2009, he visited Moscow, Russia for the first time. He told the press that since he was a boy he had always dreamed of visiting the city. He stayed at the prestigious Ritz-Carlton which offered sweeping views of the Red Square, Bolshoi Theatre and the History Museum.      Still owns a P-51D Mustang, but changed the nose art from ""Montana Miss"" to ""Kiss Me Kate"". Airplane is very rarely spotted out of hanger.      In both Rain Man (1988) and The Firm (1993), he portrays a man with an older brother named Raymond, who he helps free from a confined environment.      On January 28, 2010, he hired Amanda Lundberg as his new publicist, replacing the public relations firm Rogers & Cowan.      Lives in Beverly Hills, California, and Telluride, Colorado.      Even though the Mission: Impossible series is his signature action series, he never actually fires a gun in the original film.      Attended Princess Diana\'s funeral with, his then-wife, Nicole Kidman.      It was announced on June 29, 2012, that, after five years of marriage, Cruise and his wife, Katie Holmes, are divorcing for personal and private reasons.      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6912 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on October 16, 1986.      His attorney is Bert Fields.      Insists on preforming many of his own stunts in his films, including climbing the exterior of the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, during the filming of Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011), and driving during the car chases in Jack Reacher (2012).      His features and good looks were the model for the Disney character Aladdin (1992).      On April 3, 2013, Tom was presented with a Certificate of Irish Heritage by the Irish government in Dublin, Ireland. Tom Cruise\'s Irish roots can be traced back 840 years to the arrival of the Norman lord Strongbow in Ireland. The knights in Tom\'s family were among the first wave of Anglo-Normans to invade Ireland between 1169 and 1176. Because the family held land directly of the King, they were royal tenants, and by the early 1200s the de Cruise family were Barons in Ireland. Sir Maurice Cruys, a knight who died in 1216, is a direct ancestor of Tom Cruise\'s family. One of the lands they owned was called Hollywood in North County Dublin. They also had land in Meath; the civil parish of Cruicetown (in the parish of Nobber) was named after them.      Was Guillermo del Toro\'s first choice for the role of Stacker Pentecost in Pacific Rim (2013), but Cruise declined due to schedule conflicts with Oblivion (2013). Idris Elba was cast instead.      Attended the premiere of Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011) premiere at the Cine Lagoon in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on December 14, 2011.      Attended the premiere of Valkyrie (2008) in Mexico City, Mexico in February 5, 2009.      Attended the premiere of Mission: Impossible III (2006) in Paris, France.

[January 2009]      Along with co-star Cameron Diaz, he visited Rio de Janeiro, Brazil briefly (less then 24 hrs) to promote their latest film, Knight and Day (2010) on July 6, 2010.      Attended the premiere of Knight and Day (2010) at the Cinemex Santa Fe in Mexico City, Mexico on July 7, 2010.      As of 2014, has appeared in four films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: Rain Man (1988), Born on the Fourth of July (1989), A Few Good Men (1992) and Jerry Maguire (1996). Rain Man (1988) won in the category.      His huge fans call themselves ""Cruisers"".      Both Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames are the only actors to have appeared in all five installments of the Mission: Impossible films series from 1996 through 2015.      Revealed to People magazine in 2010, that his first celebrity crush was Ingrid Bergman in Notorious (1946). He chose an Ingrid Bergman lookalike, Rebecca Ferguson, to be his co-star in Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015) after he saw her in The White Queen (2013). Ferguson\'s character in ""Rogue Nation"" is named Ilsa, just like Bergman\'s character in Casablanca (1942).Tom Cruise was considered to play Henry Hill in Goodfellas (1990), which eventually went to Ray Liotta.      All of his ex-wives are significantly taller than he is: Mimi Rogers is 5\'8 1/2"" (1.74 m); Nicole Kidman is 5\'11"" (1.80 m); and \'Katie Holmes\' is 5\'9"" (1.75 m), while he himself is 5\'7"" (1.70 m).      As a child, he was used as kissing practice by his sister Lee Anne\'s friends.      Worked with Christopher McQuarrie on Edge of Tomorrow (2014) and Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015); both are set in West London.Emily Blunt called Tom Cruise a Chatty Cathy at a premiere for Edge of Tomorrow (2014).      Cruise did all his own stunts on Edge of Tomorrow (2014); Doug Liman felt he could make an amazing career out of it.Doug Liman felt he needed to keep up with Tom Cruise all throughout filming Edge of Tomorrow (2014).Emily Blunt thought it was fun to work with Cruise on Edge of Tomorrow (2014) because it was a challenging shoot and the exo-suits were arduous to wear everyday.      Sky Movies dedicated a whole channel to his movies in 2015, which was a world first.Edge of Tomorrow (2014) was Emily Blunt\'s first action movie; Cruise thought she was screwed because she was thrown in at the deep end.      Has spent the last few years in big budget fantasy projects like Oblivion (2013) and Edge of Tomorrow (2014).      During filming on Edge of Tomorrow (2014), Emily Blunt took Cruise and Doug Liman out for karaoke one night; she terrified Liman by getting to see her in that different light.Doug Liman wanted to do Edge of Tomorrow (2014) because it showed a role that Cruise hadn\'t done yet; someone very bad at what they do.      It was his idea to do three film premieres for Edge of Tomorrow (2014) all in one day; his co-star Emily Blunt said it was harder on her because she needed a different dress, makeup and hairdo for each one, while all he needed was a new suit, but still said they were a lot of fun. One of the premieres was at 5am and it was wet; director Doug Liman said that was a testament to Cruise\'s star power. For the film\'s London premiere, Cruise landed a helicopter in Trafalgar Square.      In the novel that inspired Edge of Tomorrow (2014), the author used the word Valkyrie, and Cruise was in the film of the same name; also, his character in the book won the order of the Valkyrie.      He has worked with 8 directors who have won an Oscar for Best Director: Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Barry Levinson, Oliver Stone, Ron Howard, Sydney Pollack, Steven Spielberg, and Robert Redford.      Good friends with: Steven Spielberg, Will Smith, David Beckham, Ben Stiller, Adam Sandler, and Jamie Foxx.Phenomenon (1996) and Independence Day (1996) were released on his 34th birthday. He was offered a role in the latter.      Was considered for the role of Vincent Mancini in The Godfather: Part III (1990).      He was originally wanted for the film Cold Mountain.      In the film Rain Man the number 3762 seen on the windscreen of a car is Tom \'s birthday - 3 July \'62.      His mother Mary Lee South died from natural causes in her sleep, surrounded by Tom and his sisters.[February 2017].      Says Vanilla Sky (2001) is the best film he\'s done.      He is the only actor to have worked with both Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick.      In 2000 he bought the screen rights to Heartswap, Celia Brayfield\'s book about partner-swapping, for his wife, Nicole Kidman, to star in.Personal Quotes (52)      The thing about filmmaking is I give it everything, that\'s why I work so hard. I always tell young actors to take charge. It\'s not that hard. Sign your own checks, be responsible.      [to Jay Leno regarding his topless Vanity Fair cover shoot] I don\'t drink but I had a beer that night and they only did one setup like that. I\'m a cheap date. What can I say?      [on Eyes Wide Shut (1999)] We knew from the beginning the level of commitment needed. We felt honored to work with Stanley Kubrick. We were going to do what it took to do this picture, whatever time, because I felt - and Nic [Nicole Kidman] did, too - that this was going to be a really special time for us. We knew it would be difficult. But I would have absolutely kicked myself if I hadn\'t done this.      I have cooked turkeys in my day but when Mom\'s around I let her do it.      I was 18 when I saw Akira Kurosawa\'s Shichinin no samurai (1954). After about 30 seconds, I realized that this was not just a cultural thing, it was universal. Years later, I read Bushido. It talked about many things that I strive for in my own life: loyalty, compassion, responsibility, the idea of looking back on your life and taking responsibility for everything you\'ve ever done. I\'m fascinated by the samurai and the samurai code - it\'s one of the main reasons I wanted to make The Last Samurai (2003).      Awards are wonderful. I\'ve been nominated many times and I\'ve won many awards. But my journey is not towards that. If it happens it will be a blast. If it doesn\'t, it\'s still been a blast.      I believe in life. I know that life comes in at your heart and it doesn\'t matter if you\'re an actor, a filmmaker or a gentleman on the street, it comes at you. What Scientology gives me is the tools to deal with that, to better enjoy my life and to be able to contribute more.      [on his role as the hit man in Collateral (2004)] I\'ve never played a character like this before. Vincent interested me because he is such an anti-social personality, bringing destruction and chaos with him wherever he goes. He\'s a force of nature.      I remember getting through high school and thinking, ""Boy, I\'m glad I got that behind me!"". Then, when I was 19, I got Risky Business (1983), and I realized, ""Ah, so this is life - it\'s a little bigger than I thought!"".      As a young actor, people were trying to define who I was before I really knew that for myself. But I still remember thinking, ""This is what I love doing, and I hope I\'m going to be able to do it forever."".      I\'ve had a very interesting life. There are ways of handling the complexities. I\'m willing to take on responsibilities as a father, as a producer, as an actor - and I enjoy that. I\'ve always been changing and evolving and growing. There\'s no pinnacle of power where you can sit back and rest.      Because I grew up in so many different places, I was used to rumors [about me]. You know, I didn\'t have the right shoes, I didn\'t have the right clothes. I even had the wrong accent.      Nic [Nicole Kidman] and I don\'t talk publicly about custody but, definitely, both of us share the kids back and forth. They\'re amazing kids.      I would live with all of my sisters if I could. We\'ve always been very close, my sisters and me.      The important thing with a child is that you love them, you protect them and you help them to grow and find out who they are. And as a parent, it\'s my responsibility to help them to become independent and get all the knowledge and a broad view of the world and life. I know that Nic [Nicole Kidman] absolutely agrees with that. And that\'s what\'s important: being there.      I\'d like to be with a woman who goes [he switches into a woman\'s voice], ""I\'ve reviewed your schedule, and I\'m going to set up this motorcycle trip for you, because you\'ve been working really hard. And I\'m going to go with you. We\'re going to go riding together. And I\'ve already been working on it for a couple days so it can be special."".      I don\'t really keep counsel with others. I\'m the kind of person who will think about something, and if I know it\'s right I\'m not going to ask anybody. I don\'t go, ""Boy, what do you think about this?"" I\'ve made every decision for myself - in my career, in my life.      SAT (exam) scores have gone right down the toilet. The parents are blaming the teachers, the teachers are blaming the parents and the psychs are putting everyone on drugs.      [on the relationship with Katie Holmes, about other people thinking it\'s a publicity stunt] It\'s amusing at first. It\'s funny. But then you sit back and realize how sad it is that there are people who can\'t even imagine feeling like this. But my friends are happy for me. The people who know me are happy. My mom is happy. My family is happy.      I\'ve never agreed with psychiatry, ever. Before I was a Scientologist, I never agreed with psychiatry. Here\'s the problem. You don\'t know the history of psychiatry. I do.      I\'m passionate about learning. I\'m passionate about life.      [on the invasion of Iraq] Personally, I don\'t have all the information President [George W. Bush] has. But I believe [Saddam Hussein] has committed many crimes against humanity and his own people.      Every single time I start to do a picture, without fail, I feel as if I don\'t know what I\'m doing.      (on his father) He was a bully and a coward. He was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my life - how he\'d lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, ""There\'s something wrong with this guy. Don\'t trust him. Be careful around him."" There\'s that anxiety.      [on Born on the Fourth of July (1989)] When I made that film people said, ""This is going to ruin your career. Why are you doing this after you did Top Gun. Why not just do Top Gun 2?"". I wanted to challenge myself.      (1992 quote) I\'m very careful in choosing things. I\'m not one of those people that\'s in, that\'s out. Once I make a decision, nothing will stop it. It\'s not something that takes me months to make a decision either, but I evaluate it very carefully, specifically, at the time, taking into account a lot of things.      (1992 quote) I really enjoy talking to other actors and directors. Sometimes, if I see their movies, I\'ll call them up or write them a note saying, ""I enjoyed it,"" or asking, ""How did you do that? How did you make that work?"". I just saw Billy Crystal\'s movie Mr. Saturday Night a couple of weeks ago - he did a phenomenal job directing this-and afterwards, I talked to him for a couple of hours. It\'s true, I can be very shy around famous people. I remember, Sean Penn and Emilio Estevez and I used to drive by Brando\'s house and Nicholson\'s house. We\'d see a light go on inside and go, ""There he is - let\'s go knock on the door,"" then go, ""Nah, nah, they\'ll never let us in."".      (1992 quote on fame) In the beginning, when people were looking at me, it could be unnerving. People just start looking at you, staring at you. I used to get nervous. Sometimes, I still get a little nervous when, all of a sudden, so much attention is directed at me just like - [snaps his fingers].      (1992, on career choices) My choices are sometimes dictated by many considerations. I\'m interested in making different kinds of movies. My path is very simple: I want to challenge myself, find something that lifts me up and makes me want to get out there and work out. Sometimes, you might look at something I\'ve done and go, ""Degree of difficulty: not so great."" But, every time, man, it\'s a new ring with a hell of a lot of work to be accomplished in it.      (1992, on A Few Good Men (1992) and working with Rob Reiner) I finished Far and Away (1992) and started immediately on it. So, the first time I met Rob Reiner - I\'d been told, ""You know, Tom, he\'s a pretty aggressive guy."" He\'s a big guy. Big hands. Very bright, articulate. When he talks his points, he gets very loud because he gets very excited. He\'s just so fucking smart. He\'s very intense, but he\'s also like a teddy bear you want to hug. We read the script together - I\'d already planned on doing it, but we were working on things like structure - and he would read it imagining the nine different characters. And he started imitating Jack Nicholson. That\'s how he found out that Jack Nicholson should play the role. The character I play, Kaffee, is a very tough, complex role to play. You\'re either going to hit or miss with this guy. All of the scenes, all the rhythms, come from character and even though Rob worked so hard on it himself, he trusts the actors to breathe life into their roles. You\'ll look over at him on the set and he\'s saying the lines along with the actors. You become really bonded with this guy because there\'s nothing more he wants for you than to be great. And you feel that.      [on his character Jack Reacher in Jack Reacher (2012)] Reacher is such a great character. He doesn\'t have a cell phone, he doesn\'t have email. He\'s off the grid. He pays for things in cash. People look at things through the prism of the colours of their life, but Jack Reacher does things the way we want to sometimes. In that sense, he\'s sort of a Dirty Harry, a James Bond, a Josey Wales.      I\'m not the Stanislavsky kind of actor. I just want to communicate with the people in the scene.      [on Rock of Ages (2012)] Adam Shankman, the director, asked me if I could carry a tune. I said, ""We\'ll see, won\'t we? This is either going to work or it\'s going to be dreadful."".      What do I want? I want a world without war. I want a world without insanity. I want to see people do well. And I don\'t even think that it\'s as much of what I want for myself. It\'s more what I want for the people around me.      (2012) I have a standard of what winning is. How do you define winning and losing? If I get beaten in a basketball game, I don\'t care. How a movie does is based on so many things, including release dates and marketing. I understand the box office game. I was there in the beginning when they started fixating on the number one film and the competition in that. I really came up with promoting films around the world, and studios fought me, but I mainly did it because I wanted myself and my kids to see the world. But here\'s the game I\'m playing. I want to make great films that entertain an audience and hold up. I can control only the effort I put into it and the experience we all have making it. After that, it is what it is.      (2012) Whether it\'s making a film or raising my children, personally I\'m striving to do the right things and to learn. I\'m an all-or-nothing kind of person, and when I become interested in something, I give it my all. In life, I always wanted adventures and to learn different fields of endeavor. The great thing about being an actor is I\'ve gotten to see what a fighter pilot\'s life is like and a race car driver\'s. I\'ve gotten to fly airplanes, race cars, learn about motorcycles. In Rock of Ages (2012), I studied music, learned how to sing and see it from a singer\'s vantage point. I carry those interests and lessons through my own life. I guess I am always striving to be competent.      (2012, on his favorite \'toy\') Each one has its different level of freedom. A fast motorcycle is wonderful, but I\'d have to say it would be the P-51 Warbird. I have a 1944 Tuskegee Airmen P-51 that was part of their training squadron. When I traveled around as a kid, I had a picture of a Spitfire and a picture of a P-51. P means ""pursuit"", and you can fly hard through the canyons. It\'s a beautiful airplane, unlike anything else.      (2012, on learning to fly) I always wanted to fly, and that was one of the reasons I did Top Gun (1986). I just never had the time to learn. Then I met Sydney Pollack. I was 19 or 20. He was editing Tootsie (1982), and I\'d just finished Risky Business (1983). I got a meeting with Sydney that was supposed to be 20 minutes and ended up being over two hours. Outside of my admiration for him as a filmmaker, we talked about a big mutual interest that we had in aviation because I knew he flew. Sydney became a lifelong friend, and when we finished The Firm (1993) together in 1993 or 1994, he gave me flying lessons as a gift. He said, ""I know how much you love flying. Take the time, right now, and do it, because otherwise you\'ll never get to it."" I had two kids by then, and I worked all the time. In a few months, I had my instrument rating and, a little while after that, I had my commercial rating. I trained mostly in aerobatics, because I wanted to fly the P-51. I was doing rolls, loops, all kinds of aerobatic maneuvers. My first airplane was called a Pitts, and then I flew a Marchetti. That\'s a third-world air force trainer they use in the Navy\'s TOPGUN schools for air-to-air combat. This was all in preparation to fly the Warbird, the P-51. I searched all over the world for my P-51 and found it in 2000. It\'s called ""Kiss Me Kate"", which covers two things I love most, my wife and movies.      [on Tony Scott] He was a creative visionary whose mark on film is immeasurable.      [on preparing for Rock of Ages (2012)] I spent months studying the history of rock \'n\' roll for my role as Stacee Jaxx and Queen and Freddie Mercury were a big part of that.      [on this intense passion for his work] I love what I do. I take great pride in what I do. And I can\'t do something halfway, three-quarters, nine-tenths. If I\'m going to do something, I go all the way.      [on what he likes about London, England] I love the fish and chips, the crews are fantastic, it\'s such a beautiful city, and the people are so easy and cool. I like a good curry, I like it hot, and you have great Indian food here also. I like it very spicy. If I\'m not sweating I don\'t feel like I have had good Indian food.      [on Ireland and his Irish ancestry] I\'m very proud to be Irish. There\'s a pride in America of being Irish. I can\'t wait to come back and I want to visit the land of my ancestors and the castle that they had.      [on Edge of Tomorrow (2014)] The alien invasion is simmering in the background. It\'s kind of Back to the Future (1985). I love movies that ask, ""If you did have to live your life over again, what would happen?"".      In 1988, Tom himself was quoted saying: ""I have always been pretty much the same weight, 147 pounds - at 5 feet 9 inches."".      [People magazine - July 5, 2010] My first celebrity crush was Ingrid Bergman in Notorious (1946).      [on Eyes Wide Shut (1999)] I didn\'t like playing Dr Bill. I didn\'t like him. It was unpleasant. But I would have absolutely kicked myself if I hadn\'t done this.      [Edge of Tomorrow] It was a lot of fun. A once in a lifetime experience.

He is the son of Baroness Maria Margareta (Rappe), a teacher, and Carl Wilhelm von Sydow, an ethnologist and folklore professor. His surname traces back to his father\'s partial German ancestry.When he was in high school, he and a few fellow students, including Yvonne Lombard, started a theatre club which encouraged his interest in acting. After conscription, he began to study at the Royal Dramatic Theatre\'s acting school (1948-1951), together with Lars Ekborg, Margaretha Krook and Ingrid Thulin. His first role was as Nils the crofter in Alf Sjöberg\'s Bara en mor (1949). After graduation, he worked at the city theatres in Norrköping and Malmö.His work in the movies by Ingmar Bergman (especially Det sjunde inseglet (1957), that includes the iconic scenes in which he plays chess with Death) made him well-known internationally, and he started to get offers from abroad. His career abroad began with him playing Jesus in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965); Hawaii (1966) and The Quiller Memorandum (1966). Since then, his career includes very different kind of characters, like Karl Oskar Nilsson in Utvandrarna (1971); Father Lankester Merrin in The Exorcist (1973); Joubert the assassin in Three Days of the Condor (1975), Emperor Ming in Flash Gordon (1980); the villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the Never Say Never Again (1983); Liet-Kynes in Dune (1984) the artist Frederick in Hannah and Her Sisters (1986); Lassefar in Pelle erobreren (1987), for which he received his first Academy Award nomination; Dr. Peter Ingham in Awakenings (1990); Lamar Burgess in Minority Report (2002) and The Renter in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011), which earned him his second Academy Award nomination.He has become one of Sweden\'s most admired and professional actors and is the only male Swedish actor to receive an Oscar nomination. Max has been nominated twice: for Pelle erobreren (1987) in 1988 and for Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011) in 2012. He received the Guldbagge Award for Best Director in his directing debut, the drama film Ved vejen (1988). In 2016, he joined the sixth season of the HBO series Game of Thrones (2011) as the Three-eyed Raven, which earned him his Primetime Emmy Award nomination.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Mattias Thuresson          Spouse (2) Catherine Brelet (30 April\xa01997            - present)\xa0(2 children)           Christina Olin (1 August\xa01951            - 1979)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(2 children)          Trade Mark (4)        Deep commanding voice        His towering height, sandy hair and thin face        Often plays stern, oppressive characters        His ability to convincingly portray deeply complex emotions with minimal dialogueTrivia (23)      Has four sons, Clas S. von Sydow and Henrik von Sydow with his first wife; and Cédric and Yvan with his second wife. In 1951, von Sydow married actress Christina Olin with whom he had two sons, Claes and Henrik. His children appeared with him in the film Hawaii (1966), playing his son at different ages. He and Olin divorced on 26 February 1979 then he married French filmmaker Catherine Brelet in April 1997 in the Provence, France. He has two sons, Yvan and Cedric, with his second wife. Cédric has appeared and has worked with him since 1994. Von Sydow lives in Paris, France with his second wife.      Was offered the title role in the first James Bond film Dr. No (1962), which went to Joseph Wiseman.      One of his favorite movies is Pelle erobreren (1987).      Has lived in Los Angeles, California, Rome, Italy and Paris, France.      Father of Henrik von Sydow and Clas S. von Sydow.      Is one of the few actors to have played both God (in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965)) and the Devil (in Needful Things (1993)).      Distant relative of Swedish speaker of parliament and ex-minister of defence, \'Björn von Sydow\'.      Has appeared in two films as a leading villain, in which plots include the use of eye replacement surgery as a means of fooling security eye scanners; as Blofeld in Never Say Never Again (1983) and Lamar Burgess in Minority Report (2002).      He appeared in 13 films directed by Ingmar Bergman: Det sjunde inseglet (1957), Smultronstället (1957), Herr Sleeman kommer (1957), Nära livet (1958), Ansiktet (1958), Rabies (1958), Jungfrukällan (1960), Såsom i en spegel (1961), Nattvardsgästerna (1963), Vargtimmen (1968), Skammen (1968), En passion (1969) and Beröringen (1971).      Was co-head of the jury at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1985.      After not appearing in an Ingmar Bergman film since Beröringen (1971), Von Sydow was reunited with the master, playing his grandfather in Den goda viljan (1991). While the film was directed by Bille August, the screenplay was written by Ingmar Bergman. Ironically, despite all the classic work Von Sydow did with Ingmar Bergman such as the Knight in Det sjunde inseglet (1957), the eponymous role in Ansiktet (1958), and the father in Jungfrukällan (1960), his first Oscar nomination came under the hand of Bille August, for Pelle erobreren (1987).      Is one of very few actors to be nominated for an Oscar for a role in a foreign language film, for his performance in Pelle erobreren (1987).      His performance as Lasse Karlsson in Pelle erobreren (1987) is ranked #57 on Premiere magazine\'s 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006).      Fluent in a number of languages, including Swedish, English, French and Italian.      In 2002, he received his French citizenship, at which time he had to renounce his Swedish citizenship.      Most of his ancestry is Swedish. His parents also both had more distant German roots, and his mother had a remote Scottish ancestor.      Was among the actors in the running for Dr. Hans Fallada in the horror film Lifeforce (1985). Frank Finlay was cast instead.      As of 2015, has appeared in five films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: Utvandrarna (1971), The Exorcist (1973), Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), Awakenings (1990) and Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011).      His second Oscar nomination (Best Supporting Actor for Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011)) came at age 82, which was the same age as front-runner Christopher Plummer who was competing with him in the category (also in a second nomination). Plummer won the Oscar for Beginners (2010), in a role previously turned down by von Sydow.      He and his The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965) co-stars Donald Pleasence and Telly Savalas all later played the Bond villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld: Pleasence in You Only Live Twice (1967), Savalas in On Her Majesty\'s Secret Service (1969) and von Sydow in Never Say Never Again (1983).      Is one of six Swedish actors to be nominated for an Academy Award. The others are Greta Garbo, Ingrid Bergman, Ann-Margret, Lena Olin and Alicia Vikander. Max is the only male Swedish actor to be nominated for an Oscar.      In his career, he has played Jesus, Satan, and was also the title character in the horror film The Exorcist (1973).      He was considered for the role of William Fawcett Robinson in Somewhere in Time (1980) before Christopher Plummer was cast.Personal Quotes (17)      The theater is more a medium for an actor than the cinema is. You are totally responsible for what you do on the stage; in a film, someone else can come in and edit you and do something totally different to what you had in mind originally, and they can cut you out, play around with the scenes or the chronology of the story. This happens always-more or less-in the cinema. On the stage, you deliver a performance and that is your responsibility. So filmmaking is much more a director\'s medium than it is an actor\'s.      If I watch my old films, for example Det sjunde inseglet (1957), I realize I do a lot of stage acting there; I have always been disturbed by the declamatory fashion in which I speak in a film like that. But then television suddenly swept through Sweden, and we were all soon accustomed to realism, from newsreels, talk shows, and then of course there was the Method school of acting, which exerted an influence in Europe also. Today, theater actors, and film actors with a stage background, use a different style to the one we subscribed to during the 1940s and 1950s. Bergman\'s dialog in those days was very stylized, so it would have been difficult for me to speak those lines realistically.      Sometimes I receive strange letters, and occasionally people come up to me in the street and say odd things. They want to be deceived, so it is difficult to disabuse them. At times, it is tiring not to be allowed to be a private person. If you are really marked out as a film star in the United States, then it must be absolutely exhausting and hard to maintain your integrity. Fortunately, Swedes are very reserved as a people and seldom show their emotions or feelings in public, so one is not subject to that kind of pressure in the country where I come from.      I admire people like Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando, Spencer Tracy, who seem to be so very real-I don\'t know how they do it. When I was young, I admired Leslie Howard enormously, in films like The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934), Gone with the Wind (1939), and Pygmalion (1938). Also Gary Cooper; perhaps he was not a great actor, but he had a great presence.      At home [in Sweden], the actor\'s profession was not considered particularly reputable, but being an actor or star in a Hollywood film was something very important in American eyes. Then I slowly realized that as an actor in Sweden you were allowed to be involved in some kind of artistic project which could be a flop and yet still be justifiable if it carried artistic weight and ambitions. In Hollywood, on the other hand, if you do not succeed you are nobody. You become a mere piece of paper with a figure on it. You are just as good-or bad-as your last film was financially. And while Sweden remains sufficiently small for you to work in, say, Malmö and still make films in Stockholm, in the States you either work in Hollywood or you live somewhere else and you work for the legitimate theater.      I have been brought up as a stage actor and there is where I feel at home, but I still feel that the cinema has one great advantage over the theater. Namely, proximity to the audience. Of course in a film an actor always has only himself as an audience while on a stage he can achieve a result along with his audience. However, when you stand on a stage, you can never work with your face in the same way as you can in front of a camera.      I am considered to be an intellectual actor and I also am one inasmuch as I want to be aware of what I am doing. But I never try to influence the writing of the manuscript.      Many persons believe that an actor must identify himself with his role. I do not do that, although I do become involved with my parts while I play them. But I find it a virtue to do things which are not of myself. This is the Swedish concept of an actor.      You have to get more involved in a [Ingmar Bergman] film than you do in others, because it deals with much deeper and more philosophic questions than the average movie. He also establishes a much closer relationship with his actors and technicians than would ever be possible on larger productions.      I don\'t think they [Ingmar Bergman\'s roles] were written for me as a personality. Many of his characters through the years have been related: there are those who want to believe but cannot, and there are those who believe like children and it\'s no problem for them at all, and there are those who do not want to believe, and there are the strains between these various characters and their conflicts, which are all probably conflicts within Ingmar himself.      People seem to think I\'m a very religious person, very serious, that I\'m an old man by now - and that I play a great deal of chess. Actually, I\'m a family person. I\'m rather private. I enjoy my work very much when it\'s interesting and, fortunately, it\'s been mostly interesting. I like nature and being outdoors. I\'m a gardener at my summer home. I like to travel. I\'m not as serious as they think I am - I don\'t even play chess. And I really don\'t know myself too well.      Acting is such a weird profession. It\'s such a futile thing. Even when it\'s there on film, there\'s nothing really to it. It is not like making a piece of furniture or writing a book.      [on how he wants people to perceive him] I want people to think, ""Maybe there is something more there."" I want to be a mystery.      When we were filming The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965), we were in Utah and many of the people on the set expected me to behave like Jesus all the time, day and night. But it\'s not method acting, is it? I couldn\'t have my wife visit me openly because Jesus was not married, and I couldn\'t take a drink and relax when I was Christ. It\'s much easier now.      [on making The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965)] Playing Christ, I began to feel shut away from the world. A newspaper became one of my biggest luxuries. I noticed that some of my close friends began treating me with reverence. Playing the role of Christ was like being in a prison. It was the hardest part I\'ve ever had to play in my life. I couldn\'t smoke or drink in public. I couldn\'t. The most difficult part of playing Christ was that I had to keep up the image around the clock. As soon as the picture finished, I returned home to Sweden and tried to find my old self. It took six months to get back to normal. When I finished the role of Christ, I felt as though I\'d been let out on parole. A man who has served 18 months isn\'t eager to go back to prison.      You see, I had an odd upbringing. My father was a scholar, a professor in the town where I was born, and his subject was folklore. He was a master at telling stories -- folk tales and adventures. I was very shy as a boy, and heard more fairy tales than the average child because of my father. This and my shyness prompted my imagination, and led to an interest in make believe.      I want variety, and I have had it, but at times it\'s been difficult and tough to achieve because people have a tendency to typecast you. If you have been successful doing one thing, they want you to copy that success all the time. And I hate that.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nSteve Harris ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 6 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(2)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(3)  Overview (2)Date of Birth3\xa0December1965,\xa0Chicago, Illinois, USA Height6\'\xa0(1.83\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Steve Harris is the son of John, a bus driver, and Mattie, a housewife, who stressed his and younger brother, Sherwin\'s education over his love for football.

After Witwer\'s departure, John is shocked when one of the Pre-Cogs named Agatha grabs onto him, asking \'Can you see?\' This is followed by a vision on a nearby screen of a woman being drowned.Shocked by this interaction, John goes down to the containment area where the supervisor named Gideon shows him around.

When his vehicle is locked-down and begins heading back to Pre-Crime, John rushes off, before being chased down by his own Pre-Crime officers. Eventually, Witwer and his men chase John into a car factory, before John manages to escape.Taking the car, he tracks down Pre-Crime\'s other co-founder, Dr. Iris Hineman. John is further shocked to find that the system that he thought was absolute, is rigged, and that not all Pre-Cogs see the same thing, but majority rules out, and the \'minority report\' is excised. Hineman suggests to John that he find a way to break back into Pre-Crime and download his minority report, if he has one, from the mind of the female Pre-Cog, Agatha.John first goes to get eye surgery from a questionable doctor, who saves his former eyes at John\'s behest. John manages to get around with his new eye, and uses his old ones to get through security eye-dent scanners in the building. John attempts to get his report from Agatha, but Danny Witwer and his men appear, prompting John to take Agatha with him.Going to a VR parlor, John recruits a man named Rufus to hack into Agatha\'s brain. However, John finds no trace of a \'minority report,\' just the same image of him shooting Leo Crow. The anger soon turns to shock when Agatha begins showing the murder of Anne Lively, which is also being recorded by Rufus. Soon after, Pre-Crime tracks John to the parlor, and he and Agatha escape from the shopping center.Nearby, John finds the apartment that was in the previz he was in. Going to the intended room, he finds a number of children\'s photos on a bed, including one of his son. When the man who is Leo Crowe enters the room, John assaults him as the man says he was the one who murdered John\'s son. However, even though he wants to, John stops short of killing Leo, intending to arrest him. The man then tells John that he is supposed to kill him, or the man who hired him says his family gets nothing. However, before John can find out more, Leo sets off John\'s gun, and the man dies.John quickly escapes with Agatha, and returns to his wife\'s house. They are safe for awhile, until Pre-Crime shows up, arresting John for the murder of Leo Crowe, and Danny Witwer.John is placed in the containment center, but is soon let out at the behest of his wife, who has found evidence against Lamarr Burgess.John then goes to a party celebrating Pre-Crime, and lets Lamarr know what he has uncovered: that Pre-Crime is built on a foundation of lies, and that he deliberately killed Anne Lively, Agatha\'s Mother, to keep his project alive. John is confronted by Lamarr, who ends up shooting himself rather than go to jail.In the end, John is cleared of his charges, and the Pre-Crime program is shuttered.

I think some people just write reviews for sites like this because they like
to complain. I actually find myself wondering if all the gripers here have
actually seen Minority Report, as I just have, because I have to say that is
one of the most gripping and involving movies I have seen in quite a while.<br><br> The content is amazing - all the little details that put the audience
firmly in the middle of the 21st century. Personally I can absolutely
believe that technology will have advanced in the kind of ways portrayed in
the film within 50 years. Just look back 50 years into the past and you
should be able to see why. The lives of everyday people in the film, where
they are scanned and advertised 'at' all day every day, apart from an excuse
for product placement (and why not?), certainly make you think about a world
where 'they' know your every move (a future towards which we are already
hurtling with some speed).<br><br> The style is amazing - why the wooden balls? Because they're cool is why. I
like to think that as we progress as a civilization we will keep a few such
elegant idiosyncrasies knocking around. The plastic, chrome and glass sets,
objects and architecture all looked clean and functional and the way that
they suck the color out of a scene worked well and gave the film a
distinctive palette. The cars are the best looking vehicles I have ever seen
in a film. I have only one criticism here - why do all the computer displays
look like Macs? Surely a touch unrealistic ;)<br><br> The story is amazing - complicated, yes, but also engrossing, exciting and
scary. There are elements here that are only hinted at, but which give the
plot a depth increasingly lacking in modern action flicks. And it asks the
kind of questions about morality, justice, exploitation and society that'll
keep you thinking for much longer that the film's two and some hours.<br><br> The direction and performances are amazing - the pre-visualization on this
movie must have been a nightmare and yet all the incredible special effects
blend perfectly into a visual style that is completely natural and assured,
as might be expected from Spielberg and Michael Kahn. There are, of course,
numerous references and homages to the work of Stanley Kubrick, which have
given a hint of the edge and flair of 'Clockwork Orange' or '2001'. I hope
it will continue to be a big influence on Spielberg.<br><br> Cruise delivers a first class performance as usual, but the discovery of
this film is Samantha Morton as Agatha. Who saw the film and didn't share
her terror and vulnerability? Little touches such as the way she clings to
Cruise, almost like a baby's reflex, make her a character you immediately
care about, innocent and tragic.<br><br> Anyway, if that's not enough to recommend the film, then you'll probably
never find another one you like again. But if you need another reason, go to
see it just for another fantastic soundtrack from the master, John Williams.<br><br> Full marks, five stars, a must see several times and buy the DVD movie.<br><br>

I read a lot of previous posts about this movie. This is one of the best
films of the year, and of recent years. This is a perfect blend of action,
suspense, thrills and film-noir. The plot is intelligent and fresh. People
saying it is not original must have slept through the movie. Tom Cruise is
fantastic, Colin Farrell is amazing, as well as Samantha Morton. Spielberg
again proves that he is the master of cinema. A truly great director. I'll
agree, the ending was a little too happy, but not worth complaining about.
This film is not about product placement as previously suggested, it is
simply a entertaining and yet realistic glimpse of what our future may
look
like, as advertising becomes more advanced and intrusive. The film creates
many moral questions and issues, and should leave you thinking. Is being
arrested for doing something you actually havn't commited yet fair? It is
worth seeing again and again. As a film lover and critic, i can say it is
one amazing movie.

Steven Spielberg sets Minority Report in the near future of 2054, in
which the technology is advanced, but not far-fetched. Cars can drive
themselves and ride up elevators, computers come with holograms as a
user interface, and stores recognize you from your eyeball scan. As all
science fiction fans know, however, the genre is not about technology
but about ideas. The big idea for Minority Report is based on a short
story by the venerable Philip K. Dick. In this future, there is a
""pre-crime"" unit in the police force, which revolves around three
psychics who are able to see violent crimes before they occur. These
visions are projected in a flat screen panel and manipulated by
detectives with the grace of a symphony conductor. Equipped with
futuristic stun guns, jet packs, and search robots, these cops then
arrest and intern the criminals before the crimes are committed.<br><br>We learn all this in the first ten minutes of the movie. After this
introduction, the plot really starts when Detective John Anderton (Tom
Cruise) finds out that the precogs saw him kill someone, someone that
he has never met. He finds himself in a race. With the forced
recruitment of a precog, Agatha (Samantha Morton), he must clear his
name before the predetermined murder. All the while, his old buddies,
now helped with a special agent from the FBI (Colin Farrell), are
trying to track him down.<br><br>Spielberg, with Janusz Kaminski, his cinematographer for many films,
have crafted a visually stunning movie. The special effects are
seamlessly incorporated of the world they created. The muted blues echo
the style of black &amp; white film noirs. John Anderton is similar to
noir's morally ambiguous characters--a good cop with an illegal habit
that is forced (by circumstances and desire) to betray the very things
he loves.<br><br>But this is not just a special effects or mystery movie. The
characters, all well drawn, are supremely acted by the cast. Tom Cruise
is a good physical actor and he shows it here. By the way he sits or
walks, we can intuit the grief and confusion that's going through him.
Samantha Morton does a good job of portraying a haunted young lady who
has seen too much. Colin Farrell skillfully balances the ambitious and
professional sides of his character. As always, Max von Sydow
authoritatively plays the respected father figure.<br><br>This is one of my favorite Science Fiction films. I would also
recommend the following films. These (I think) influenced Minority
Report.<br><br>""The Maltese Falcon"" ~ film noir ""A Clockwork Orange"" ~ science fiction
""Blade Runner"" ~ science fiction (also based on a Dick story)<br><br>***** out of *****

The future, we are told, are what we make of it. Philip K. Dick did not
want to take that chance, so he wrote many many many short stories
about the future of man and where we, as a society, were headed. Blade
Runner, Total Recall, Paycheck, Screamers, and Minority Report are all
short stories written by Dick about the future that have been turned
into a movie, and most have a less than enthusiastic view of where we
are headed. In Minority Report, we see the effects of predicting the
future to the point of crimes are prevented by arresting murderers
before they kill. If that does not appear logical, there is a quick
little scene early in the movie that addresses those concerns, and on
the surface makes sense. Tom Cruise plays the Washington, DC pre-crime
chief, John Anderton, who runs the investigators who rely on 3
scientifically engineered beings who can see murders before they
happen. The system, of course, raises civil liberty issues, but seems
to work perfectly, that is until Anderton is fingered for a murder. The
rest of the movie, Anderton tries to not only prove that he is
innocent, but also that he was set up, possibly by an oily Department
of Justice figure who is investigating Precrime before it goes national
after an election, played by Colin Farrell. Directed by Steven
Spielberg, Minority Report plays as both a ""Whodunnit?"" and a
futuristic exercise of science fiction. Much time was spent on
designing the Washington, DC of the 2050s, including cars that run on
magnets, virtual reality stations, and much more throughout the film.
The most interesting design is of the ""sick sticks"" used by cops to
bring down criminals. The blueish tint given to the film also gives us
a cold feeling, a future that is not as loving or as hospitable as the
time we live in, another trait of a Dick story. A wonderful movie the
works for both the crime buff and the science fiction fan.

This is spoken in Minority Report by a drug-dealer on the streets with no
eyes at all, so I suppose its free advice for John Anderton, our hero, or a
bit of wise-sounding advice meant to get across to the audience but with no
other good place for it to fit in the film. This is fine with me, too,
because Minority Report is such a taut futuristic thriller that an
incongruous little bit of wisdom like this is not to have any negative
impact on the film as a whole. John Anderton, played with precision by the
great Tom Cruise (oh shut up, the man's awesome), is the chief of the
Pre-Crime department in the District of Columbia, which has successfully
eradicated murder entirely for the last six years. He works with a group of
`pre-cogs' that, together, dream of murders that have not yet taken place
and project enough information for Anderton and his team to watch the video
emanating from their heads to determine where and when the murders are to
take place and to get to those locations and stop the murders from happening
before they happen. <br><br>This is obviously a formula for a highly successful action movie, but the
thing that really makes Minority Report succeed is that it pays so much
amount of attention to things that would occur in this situation in real
life. It is explained very early in the film that the invention of Pre-Crime
has eradicated premeditated murder, as this is most easily detected by the
pre-cogs. The majority of the `business,' then, of the Pre-Crime division in
the District of Columbia, are crimes of passion. This not only provides the
possibility of a lot more tension in that these crimes leave a lot less time
for prevention, but also avoids complicating the plot with the details of
premeditated murders. We don't care about a guy who wronged another guy five
years ago or drug deals gone bad, all we need to hear about are a guy who
comes home to find his wife in bed with another man and loses control.<br><br>Given the fact that the movie involves some sort of time-travel (even if
information is the only thing traveling through time), it leaves itself open
to criticism about plot holes. This is obvious, because plot holes like this
even permeated the unparalleled Back to the Future series, which obviously
had plenty of plot holes but handled them spectacularly well. Given the
amount of movies that I have seen that involve time travel, I have come up
with this equation: Time Travel = Plot Holes. This is a universal equation
that is never escaped, but it does not mean that any movie that involves
time travel will be brought down by the subsequent and unavoidable plot
holes. Minority Report did not suffer from its necessary plot holes and
neither did the timeless Back to the Future series (which has FINALLY been
released as a complete set and which no respectable movie collection could
possibly be without). <br><br>My esteemed colleague and close friend Christopher Brown (see his brilliant
reviews at http://us.imdb.com/CommentsAuthor?625436) points out one of these
plot holes in his review of Minority Report, but makes the mistake of
suggesting that, given the nature of the precognition and of the crime
itself, Anderton's murder should never have been predicted since it did not
entail premeditation. Sorry, Chris, but you've missed the boat on this one.
The only thing that this does is bring up the fact that it's impossible to
tell where precognition starts. It could be argued perfectly well that the
pre-cogs played a part in their own precognition. They predicted that
Anderton would commit the murder under the circumstances that he would have
been watching the thoughts of the pre-cogs and seen that he would commit
murder, and then obviously sought to find out for himself how he could have
been expected to commit a murder against a person he has never heard of. In
this case, if he had called in sick that day, all of this would have been
avoided. But he's the best at what he does, he has personal reasons for
wanting to stop murder, he does not slack off, he does not call in sick.
John Anderton was predicted by the pre-cogs to commit murder because he was
at work that day. <br><br>The action in the film comes from the possibility that the whole prediction
of Anderton's murder might be what is called a `minority report,' where the
pre-cogs disagree on something that is going to happen. If he can prove that
only one of the pre-cogs came up with the vision that he was going to commit
a murder, it might cancel out the entire prediction because it is
unreliable. On the way to this goal, we are presented with everything from a
tremendously dedicated investigator (played brilliantly by Colin Farrell) to
some amazingly creepy but strangely accepted identification spiders that
scan John's implanted eye in one of the more uncomfortable scenes in the
film. <br><br>Minority Report is one of the best and most unique thrillers to be released
in years. It is the conglomeration of such a dizzying array of films that it
is difficult to contemplate them all at once. We see elements of action
films, futuristic thrillers, crime films, science fiction, and of course,
the influence of Stanley Kubrick is never far off. There is even, especially
in the later portion of the film, a heavy influence on the soundtrack by
Bernard Herrman, who was the composer for most of Alfred Hitchcock's films,
among many others. It's always nice to see such a respectful homage like
that, and it is only one of the many things that makes Minority Report yet
another addition to Steven Spielberg's extensive list of high-end films (the
last of which was the spectacular A.I.). The only thing I can think of that
holds Minority Report back from joining Spielberg's list of timeless
classics is that it does not have the scope as far as its target audience as
such films as E.T. and Jurassic Park. However, despite not having quite as
large of a target audience, Minority Report stands as a strong entry in
Spielberg's growing list of great films.

This gets high marks for being an involving film that, despite a long
length of almost two- and-a-half hours, keeps ones interest all the
way. Being a Stephen Spielberg-directed film, it's no surprise that the
photography is first-rate. This is nice-looking movie. Tom Cruise also
was very good in here, not the obnoxious character he sometimes
portrays (or did more often in his younger days.).<br><br>The film is a good mixture of action and suspense. Only the one chase
scene was overdone with Rambo-like mentality of the good guys not
getting hit when they should, and vice- versa.<br><br>The subject matter is interesting, too: what would do you (or the
police) had very reliable information on crimes that were about to be
committed, that you could prevent things from happening before they
actually did?<br><br>I recognized two people in here who went on shortly thereafter to
become recognizable in TV series: Kathryn Morris (""Cold Case"") and Neal
McDonough (""Boomtown""). Add Colin Farrell, Max Von Sydow, Samantha
Morton and you have an interesting cast. I am of the opinion that this
is one of Spielberg's underrated gems.

May be this film has some flaws but while watching it I wasn't too
distracted by that. Here we have one of the greatest directors alive (Steven
Spielberg), a very big star (Tom Cruise) with a great ensemble (Max von
Sydow, Colin Farrell, Peter Stormare, Samantha Morton, Tim Blake Nelson)
around him, a good cinematography (Janusz Kaminski) and a nice score by John
Williams all packed in a great story (based on the novel by Philip K. Dick)
with perfect visual effects.<br><br>In the year 2054 murders can be predicted and stopped before they happen. If
you were about to kill but stopped you are locked. Tom Cruise is one of the
agents who stops those murders. Then he discovers the next murder they have
to stop will be committed by himself.<br><br>I will not reveal more of the plot. The story itself is great. It is
intelligent, but also exciting with great action scenes. The visuals are
truly beautiful and perfectly support the sci-fi story. If you like action
thrillers and you don't mind they are set in the future (with some
futuristic gadgets) this is your film. 9/10.

Steven Spielberg is at his directorial best with this action, adventure.
Tom Cruise is at his acting best as a futuristic cop on the run.  I was
pleased to see one of the best directors team up with one of the best
actors
to make a brilliant movie.<br><br>Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, the chief of the Pre-Crime unit of the
Washington D.C. police department.  This unit stops murders before they
happen, with the help of the ""Pre-Cogs.""  The ""Pre-Cogs"" are three
psychics
who see the murders before they happen, and Cruise is the one who puts
their
visions together to predict the location, the killer, and the victim of
the
future crime. So far, the ""Pre-Cog"" division has been successful, with its
six-year span going on with no murder ever happening.  Things get
complicated for the future of Pre-Crime when Detective Danny Witwer,
played
by Colin Farrell, is sent to inspect the operation.  Anderton is
suspicious
of him, because he starts to see cracks in the system.  When Anderton
believes that the cracks are minor, he believes wrong.<br><br>Anderton sees another murder happening in the Pre-Cogs' visions and is
shocked to see that he is the man committing the murder.  Now that he is
on
the run from his own men, which of course is under the command of Witwer,
Anderton must unravel the mystery of why he has to murder a man whom he
hasn't even met yet.  As time runs out, Anderton finds clues that there is
a
conspiracy behind it.  Can he figure them out in time, or will Pre-Crime
see
its first murder in six years?<br><br>""Minority Report"" is a movie with a fantastic storyline, one of the best
I've ever heard of.  The actors are great, the directing is great, of
course, it's Spielberg.  Even the effects are great, they are done with
ILM.
Roger Ebert says that this movie ""reminds us why we go to the movies in

Steven Spielberg is a genius. So many great films he has directed. The
Man who created ""Jaws"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Schindlers List"" is
back for more. In one of his best pictures yet. <br><br>It's 2054. A new method of crime prevention ""pre-crime"" allows the
police to look into the future and see the horrific results of murder
and rape as they unfold. After a quick introduction to this process,
were straight into the big and bold; main man John Anderton (Tom
Cruise) is accused of a future murder- to a man he's never heard of. So
he's on the run, from a harsh detective (superbly played by Colin
Farrell) as he uncovers some horrible truths and has to go back to the
unwelcoming past. <br><br>Minority report is very good, but also very disturbing- the fact that
this film was a PG-13 or a ""12"" in England is shocking. Parents, a
note: if your child is under 12 at least I would strongly recommend you
watch this film first. It's dark, compelling, and disturbing-
particularly in a scene where he has to exchange his eyes for
protection... <br><br>This is a fantastic film however that should be viewed and loved by
everyone bold enough to come in its path. Never fail to believe:
Spielberg has come up with yet another masterpiece. <br><br>Overall: ****/ out of ***** (4 and a half out of 5)
</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>

It's an open secret: the Oscar is jinxed.  Spielberg's triumph with
""Schindler's List"" was followed by the longest hiatus of his career, which
was broken with ... ""Jurassic Park II"", a lifeless sequel of the kind you'd
once have sworn he'd never make - the single worst and most anonymous movie
he's ever directed (""Hook"" had its moments).  His next two films were
improvements (there was nowhere to go but up): the first anonymous but not
bad (""Amistad""), the second bad but not anonymous (""Saving Private Ryan""),
but they were both pompous gestures which appear to have been designed to
win still more awards; and it wasn't until eight years after ""Schindler's
List"" that the skilled director of old times re-appeared (with ""A.I."" in
2001).<br><br>But he's well and truly back now, and I'm happy.  I've even learned to
welcome it when he makes decisions which infuriate me, so long as he makes
them with the right kind of self-assured arrogance.  I didn't like the
voice-over at the end (we didn't need to be told that stuff; we could have
worked it out), or the way he caved in to the modern tendency to be
needlessly revolting (at least he don't play his gross-out moments for cheap
laughs), or even the style of photography (it's easy to manipulate us into
thinking the future is a grim place, if you push-process the film until even
the images which in the normal course of events would be luscious and rich,
are grimy and desaturated - there are other ways of getting colourless
images, as Spielberg well knows, and many of them are better).  Yet, in the
end, big deal.  The story is a knockout, the action is taut, the future
rich, dazzling and believable.  Spielberg is to be particularly
congratulated on how completely he has avoided the unimaginative dystopia of
""Blade Runner"".  The future we see here is a MIX of dream and nightmare, so
convincing a mix that we can't always tell them apart.<br><br>Here's a measure of how good the movie is: in an interview, Spielberg
revealed that he completely misunderstood the issues which drive the stories
- and there's simply no way of telling this from the finished product. 
Unless Spielberg was just opportunistically latching on to the hook forced
on him by a dim-witted journalist, he THOUGHT the movie was about how much
freedom we are willing to give up in exchange for safety (in order to
prevent terrorist attacks, for instance).  This is interpretation is
strained.  Three people (the precogs) do indeed give up their freedom in
order that millions of other people may be safer, and yes, there is an issue
here.  When one of the Crime Prevention officer says, ""It's best not to
think of them as human"", I was surprised to find myself nodding in
agreement.  The benefits of the system are so great that OF COURSE I'd
rather not look too closely into the burden that must be borne by three -
just three - individuals.  Aside from the three unfortunate precogs, nobody
is asked to give up any freedom at all.  (Except, of course, the freedom to
commit murder.  But under the law we are already unfree to commit murder,
and a good thing too.)<br><br>The interesting issues that DO fall naturally out of the story concern the
futility of revenge.  After people who would otherwise have committed murder
are prevented from doing so, they're sent to prison anyway, presumably on
the grounds that that's what they deserve - and no doubt it IS what they
deserve.  But it's clear enough that locking these people up, however much
it may be in the interests of justice, serves no purpose.  It's exacting
revenge on criminals for the sake of exacting revenge - which is exactly
what the U.S. justice system is committed to doing at the moment, which is
why the future is a realistic one.  (Apart from the precognition, that is.) 
Anderton's mistake is to believe in the value of revenge, and he's never
more admirable than when he realises his mistake.  (THAT was a great scene;
it's a pity I can't tell you exactly why.  Suffice it to say that when we
think we know where the story's going, we may indeed know where the story's
going - but Spielberg is only allowing us to see so much of what's coming up
in order to obscure the rest of it.)<br><br>The final sign that Spielberg is again at his peak lies in the performances.
 They're all good.  Tom Cruise's weakness as an actor is that he is only
ever as good as his director, and the fact that he's so good here means that
""Minority Report"" was directed by the real Spielberg, the old Spielberg, the
Spielberg with the same ability Charles Dickens had to make even his most
grotesque creations, and even his LEAST grotesque, come to
life.

films of the year, and of recent years. This is a perfect blend of action,
suspense, thrills and film-noir. The plot is intelligent and fresh. People
saying it is not original must have slept through the movie. Tom Cruise is
fantastic, Colin Farrell is amazing, as well as Samantha Morton. Spielberg
again proves that he is the master of cinema. A truly great director. I'll
agree, the ending was a little too happy, but not worth complaining about.
This film is not about product placement as previously suggested, it is
simply a entertaining and yet realistic glimpse of what our future may
look
like, as advertising becomes more advanced and intrusive. The film creates
many moral questions and issues, and should leave you thinking. Is being
arrested for doing something you actually havn't commited yet fair? It is
worth seeing again and again. As a film lover and critic, i can say it is
one amazing movie.

Steven Spielberg sets Minority Report in the near future of 2054, in
which the technology is advanced, but not far-fetched. Cars can drive
themselves and ride up elevators, computers come with holograms as a
user interface, and stores recognize you from your eyeball scan. As all
science fiction fans know, however, the genre is not about technology
but about ideas. The big idea for Minority Report is based on a short
story by the venerable Philip K. Dick. In this future, there is a
""pre-crime"" unit in the police force, which revolves around three
psychics who are able to see violent crimes before they occur. These
visions are projected in a flat screen panel and manipulated by
detectives with the grace of a symphony conductor. Equipped with
futuristic stun guns, jet packs, and search robots, these cops then
arrest and intern the criminals before the crimes are committed.<br><br>We learn all this in the first ten minutes of the movie. After this
introduction, the plot really starts when Detective John Anderton (Tom
Cruise) finds out that the precogs saw him kill someone, someone that
he has never met. He finds himself in a race. With the forced
recruitment of a precog, Agatha (Samantha Morton), he must clear his
name before the predetermined murder. All the while, his old buddies,
now helped with a special agent from the FBI (Colin Farrell), are
trying to track him down.<br><br>Spielberg, with Janusz Kaminski, his cinematographer for many films,
have crafted a visually stunning movie. The special effects are
seamlessly incorporated of the world they created. The muted blues echo
the style of black &amp; white film noirs. John Anderton is similar to
noir's morally ambiguous characters--a good cop with an illegal habit
that is forced (by circumstances and desire) to betray the very things
he loves.<br><br>But this is not just a special effects or mystery movie. The
characters, all well drawn, are supremely acted by the cast. Tom Cruise
is a good physical actor and he shows it here. By the way he sits or
walks, we can intuit the grief and confusion that's going through him.
Samantha Morton does a good job of portraying a haunted young lady who
has seen too much. Colin Farrell skillfully balances the ambitious and
professional sides of his character. As always, Max von Sydow
authoritatively plays the respected father figure.<br><br>This is one of my favorite Science Fiction films. I would also
recommend the following films. These (I think) influenced Minority
Report.<br><br>""The Maltese Falcon"" ~ film noir ""A Clockwork Orange"" ~ science fiction
""Blade Runner"" ~ science fiction (also based on a Dick story)<br><br>***** out of *****

The future, we are told, are what we make of it. Philip K. Dick did not
want to take that chance, so he wrote many many many short stories
about the future of man and where we, as a society, were headed. Blade
Runner, Total Recall, Paycheck, Screamers, and Minority Report are all
short stories written by Dick about the future that have been turned
into a movie, and most have a less than enthusiastic view of where we
are headed. In Minority Report, we see the effects of predicting the
future to the point of crimes are prevented by arresting murderers
before they kill. If that does not appear logical, there is a quick
little scene early in the movie that addresses those concerns, and on
the surface makes sense. Tom Cruise plays the Washington, DC pre-crime
chief, John Anderton, who runs the investigators who rely on 3
scientifically engineered beings who can see murders before they
happen. The system, of course, raises civil liberty issues, but seems
to work perfectly, that is until Anderton is fingered for a murder. The
rest of the movie, Anderton tries to not only prove that he is
innocent, but also that he was set up, possibly by an oily Department
of Justice figure who is investigating Precrime before it goes national
after an election, played by Colin Farrell. Directed by Steven
Spielberg, Minority Report plays as both a ""Whodunnit?"" and a
futuristic exercise of science fiction. Much time was spent on
designing the Washington, DC of the 2050s, including cars that run on
magnets, virtual reality stations, and much more throughout the film.
The most interesting design is of the ""sick sticks"" used by cops to
bring down criminals. The blueish tint given to the film also gives us
a cold feeling, a future that is not as loving or as hospitable as the
time we live in, another trait of a Dick story. A wonderful movie the
works for both the crime buff and the science fiction fan.

This is spoken in Minority Report by a drug-dealer on the streets with no
eyes at all, so I suppose its free advice for John Anderton, our hero, or a
bit of wise-sounding advice meant to get across to the audience but with no
other good place for it to fit in the film. This is fine with me, too,
because Minority Report is such a taut futuristic thriller that an
incongruous little bit of wisdom like this is not to have any negative
impact on the film as a whole. John Anderton, played with precision by the
great Tom Cruise (oh shut up, the man's awesome), is the chief of the
Pre-Crime department in the District of Columbia, which has successfully
eradicated murder entirely for the last six years. He works with a group of
`pre-cogs' that, together, dream of murders that have not yet taken place
and project enough information for Anderton and his team to watch the video
emanating from their heads to determine where and when the murders are to
take place and to get to those locations and stop the murders from happening
before they happen. <br><br>This is obviously a formula for a highly successful action movie, but the
thing that really makes Minority Report succeed is that it pays so much
amount of attention to things that would occur in this situation in real
life. It is explained very early in the film that the invention of Pre-Crime
has eradicated premeditated murder, as this is most easily detected by the
pre-cogs. The majority of the `business,' then, of the Pre-Crime division in
the District of Columbia, are crimes of passion. This not only provides the
possibility of a lot more tension in that these crimes leave a lot less time
for prevention, but also avoids complicating the plot with the details of
premeditated murders. We don't care about a guy who wronged another guy five
years ago or drug deals gone bad, all we need to hear about are a guy who
comes home to find his wife in bed with another man and loses control.<br><br>Given the fact that the movie involves some sort of time-travel (even if
information is the only thing traveling through time), it leaves itself open
to criticism about plot holes. This is obvious, because plot holes like this
even permeated the unparalleled Back to the Future series, which obviously
had plenty of plot holes but handled them spectacularly well. Given the
amount of movies that I have seen that involve time travel, I have come up
with this equation: Time Travel = Plot Holes. This is a universal equation
that is never escaped, but it does not mean that any movie that involves
time travel will be brought down by the subsequent and unavoidable plot
holes. Minority Report did not suffer from its necessary plot holes and
neither did the timeless Back to the Future series (which has FINALLY been
released as a complete set and which no respectable movie collection could
possibly be without). <br><br>My esteemed colleague and close friend Christopher Brown (see his brilliant
reviews at http://us.imdb.com/CommentsAuthor?625436) points out one of these
plot holes in his review of Minority Report, but makes the mistake of
suggesting that, given the nature of the precognition and of the crime
itself, Anderton's murder should never have been predicted since it did not
entail premeditation. Sorry, Chris, but you've missed the boat on this one.
The only thing that this does is bring up the fact that it's impossible to
tell where precognition starts. It could be argued perfectly well that the
pre-cogs played a part in their own precognition. They predicted that
Anderton would commit the murder under the circumstances that he would have
been watching the thoughts of the pre-cogs and seen that he would commit
murder, and then obviously sought to find out for himself how he could have
been expected to commit a murder against a person he has never heard of. In
this case, if he had called in sick that day, all of this would have been
avoided. But he's the best at what he does, he has personal reasons for
wanting to stop murder, he does not slack off, he does not call in sick.
John Anderton was predicted by the pre-cogs to commit murder because he was
at work that day. <br><br>The action in the film comes from the possibility that the whole prediction
of Anderton's murder might be what is called a `minority report,' where the
pre-cogs disagree on something that is going to happen. If he can prove that
only one of the pre-cogs came up with the vision that he was going to commit
a murder, it might cancel out the entire prediction because it is
unreliable. On the way to this goal, we are presented with everything from a
tremendously dedicated investigator (played brilliantly by Colin Farrell) to
some amazingly creepy but strangely accepted identification spiders that
scan John's implanted eye in one of the more uncomfortable scenes in the
film. <br><br>Minority Report is one of the best and most unique thrillers to be released
in years. It is the conglomeration of such a dizzying array of films that it
is difficult to contemplate them all at once. We see elements of action
films, futuristic thrillers, crime films, science fiction, and of course,
the influence of Stanley Kubrick is never far off. There is even, especially
in the later portion of the film, a heavy influence on the soundtrack by
Bernard Herrman, who was the composer for most of Alfred Hitchcock's films,
among many others. It's always nice to see such a respectful homage like
that, and it is only one of the many things that makes Minority Report yet
another addition to Steven Spielberg's extensive list of high-end films (the
last of which was the spectacular A.I.). The only thing I can think of that
holds Minority Report back from joining Spielberg's list of timeless
classics is that it does not have the scope as far as its target audience as
such films as E.T. and Jurassic Park. However, despite not having quite as
large of a target audience, Minority Report stands as a strong entry in
Spielberg's growing list of great films.

This gets high marks for being an involving film that, despite a long
length of almost two- and-a-half hours, keeps ones interest all the
way. Being a Stephen Spielberg-directed film, it's no surprise that the
photography is first-rate. This is nice-looking movie. Tom Cruise also
was very good in here, not the obnoxious character he sometimes
portrays (or did more often in his younger days.).<br><br>The film is a good mixture of action and suspense. Only the one chase
scene was overdone with Rambo-like mentality of the good guys not
getting hit when they should, and vice- versa.<br><br>The subject matter is interesting, too: what would do you (or the
police) had very reliable information on crimes that were about to be
committed, that you could prevent things from happening before they
actually did?<br><br>I recognized two people in here who went on shortly thereafter to
become recognizable in TV series: Kathryn Morris (""Cold Case"") and Neal
McDonough (""Boomtown""). Add Colin Farrell, Max Von Sydow, Samantha
Morton and you have an interesting cast. I am of the opinion that this
is one of Spielberg's underrated gems.

May be this film has some flaws but while watching it I wasn't too
distracted by that. Here we have one of the greatest directors alive (Steven
Spielberg), a very big star (Tom Cruise) with a great ensemble (Max von
Sydow, Colin Farrell, Peter Stormare, Samantha Morton, Tim Blake Nelson)
around him, a good cinematography (Janusz Kaminski) and a nice score by John
Williams all packed in a great story (based on the novel by Philip K. Dick)
with perfect visual effects.<br><br>In the year 2054 murders can be predicted and stopped before they happen. If
you were about to kill but stopped you are locked. Tom Cruise is one of the
agents who stops those murders. Then he discovers the next murder they have
to stop will be committed by himself.<br><br>I will not reveal more of the plot. The story itself is great. It is
intelligent, but also exciting with great action scenes. The visuals are
truly beautiful and perfectly support the sci-fi story. If you like action
thrillers and you don't mind they are set in the future (with some
futuristic gadgets) this is your film. 9/10.

Steven Spielberg is at his directorial best with this action, adventure.
Tom Cruise is at his acting best as a futuristic cop on the run.  I was
pleased to see one of the best directors team up with one of the best
actors
to make a brilliant movie.<br><br>Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, the chief of the Pre-Crime unit of the
Washington D.C. police department.  This unit stops murders before they
happen, with the help of the ""Pre-Cogs.""  The ""Pre-Cogs"" are three
psychics
who see the murders before they happen, and Cruise is the one who puts
their
visions together to predict the location, the killer, and the victim of
the
future crime. So far, the ""Pre-Cog"" division has been successful, with its
six-year span going on with no murder ever happening.  Things get
complicated for the future of Pre-Crime when Detective Danny Witwer,
played
by Colin Farrell, is sent to inspect the operation.  Anderton is
suspicious
of him, because he starts to see cracks in the system.  When Anderton
believes that the cracks are minor, he believes wrong.<br><br>Anderton sees another murder happening in the Pre-Cogs' visions and is
shocked to see that he is the man committing the murder.  Now that he is
on
the run from his own men, which of course is under the command of Witwer,
Anderton must unravel the mystery of why he has to murder a man whom he
hasn't even met yet.  As time runs out, Anderton finds clues that there is
a
conspiracy behind it.  Can he figure them out in time, or will Pre-Crime
see
its first murder in six years?<br><br>""Minority Report"" is a movie with a fantastic storyline, one of the best
I've ever heard of.  The actors are great, the directing is great, of
course, it's Spielberg.  Even the effects are great, they are done with
ILM.
Roger Ebert says that this movie ""reminds us why we go to the movies in
the
first place,"" and I agree with him.

Steven Spielberg is a genius. So many great films he has directed. The
Man who created ""Jaws"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Schindlers List"" is
back for more. In one of his best pictures yet. <br><br>It's 2054. A new method of crime prevention ""pre-crime"" allows the
police to look into the future and see the horrific results of murder
and rape as they unfold. After a quick introduction to this process,
were straight into the big and bold; main man John Anderton (Tom
Cruise) is accused of a future murder- to a man he's never heard of. So
he's on the run, from a harsh detective (superbly played by Colin
Farrell) as he uncovers some horrible truths and has to go back to the
unwelcoming past. <br><br>Minority report is very good, but also very disturbing- the fact that
this film was a PG-13 or a ""12"" in England is shocking. Parents, a
note: if your child is under 12 at least I would strongly recommend you
watch this film first. It's dark, compelling, and disturbing-
particularly in a scene where he has to exchange his eyes for
protection... <br><br>This is a fantastic film however that should be viewed and loved by
everyone bold enough to come in its path. Never fail to believe:
Spielberg has come up with yet another masterpiece. <br><br>Overall: ****/ out of ***** (4 and a half out of 5)
</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>

It's an open secret: the Oscar is jinxed.  Spielberg's triumph with
""Schindler's List"" was followed by the longest hiatus of his career, which
was broken with ... ""Jurassic Park II"", a lifeless sequel of the kind you'd
once have sworn he'd never make - the single worst and most anonymous movie
he's ever directed (""Hook"" had its moments).  His next two films were
improvements (there was nowhere to go but up): the first anonymous but not
bad (""Amistad""), the second bad but not anonymous (""Saving Private Ryan""),
but they were both pompous gestures which appear to have been designed to
win still more awards; and it wasn't until eight years after ""Schindler's
List"" that the skilled director of old times re-appeared (with ""A.I."" in
2001).<br><br>But he's well and truly back now, and I'm happy.  I've even learned to
welcome it when he makes decisions which infuriate me, so long as he makes
them with the right kind of self-assured arrogance.  I didn't like the
voice-over at the end (we didn't need to be told that stuff; we could have
worked it out), or the way he caved in to the modern tendency to be
needlessly revolting (at least he don't play his gross-out moments for cheap
laughs), or even the style of photography (it's easy to manipulate us into
thinking the future is a grim place, if you push-process the film until even
the images which in the normal course of events would be luscious and rich,
are grimy and desaturated - there are other ways of getting colourless
images, as Spielberg well knows, and many of them are better).  Yet, in the
end, big deal.  The story is a knockout, the action is taut, the future
rich, dazzling and believable.  Spielberg is to be particularly
congratulated on how completely he has avoided the unimaginative dystopia of
""Blade Runner"".  The future we see here is a MIX of dream and nightmare, so
convincing a mix that we can't always tell them apart.<br><br>Here's a measure of how good the movie is: in an interview, Spielberg
revealed that he completely misunderstood the issues which drive the stories
- and there's simply no way of telling this from the finished product. 
Unless Spielberg was just opportunistically latching on to the hook forced
on him by a dim-witted journalist, he THOUGHT the movie was about how much
freedom we are willing to give up in exchange for safety (in order to
prevent terrorist attacks, for instance).  This is interpretation is
strained.  Three people (the precogs) do indeed give up their freedom in
order that millions of other people may be safer, and yes, there is an issue
here.  When one of the Crime Prevention officer says, ""It's best not to
think of them as human"", I was surprised to find myself nodding in
agreement.  The benefits of the system are so great that OF COURSE I'd
rather not look too closely into the burden that must be borne by three -
just three - individuals.  Aside from the three unfortunate precogs, nobody
is asked to give up any freedom at all.  (Except, of course, the freedom to
commit murder.  But under the law we are already unfree to commit murder,
and a good thing too.)<br><br>The interesting issues that DO fall naturally out of the story concern the
futility of revenge.  After people who would otherwise have committed murder
are prevented from doing so, they're sent to prison anyway, presumably on
the grounds that that's what they deserve - and no doubt it IS what they
deserve.  But it's clear enough that locking these people up, however much
it may be in the interests of justice, serves no purpose.  It's exacting
revenge on criminals for the sake of exacting revenge - which is exactly
what the U.S. justice system is committed to doing at the moment, which is
why the future is a realistic one.  (Apart from the precognition, that is.) 
Anderton's mistake is to believe in the value of revenge, and he's never
more admirable than when he realises his mistake.  (THAT was a great scene;
it's a pity I can't tell you exactly why.  Suffice it to say that when we
think we know where the story's going, we may indeed know where the story's
going - but Spielberg is only allowing us to see so much of what's coming up
in order to obscure the rest of it.)<br><br>The final sign that Spielberg is again at his peak lies in the performances.
 They're all good.  Tom Cruise's weakness as an actor is that he is only
ever as good as his director, and the fact that he's so good here means that
""Minority Report"" was directed by the real Spielberg, the old Spielberg, the
Spielberg with the same ability Charles Dickens had to make even his most
grotesque creations, and even his LEAST grotesque, come to
life.
