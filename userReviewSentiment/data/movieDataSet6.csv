Paget\'s sister Teala Loring got her movie breaks in the 1940s, Lisa Gaye was a film and TV star in the 50s and 60s, and even brother Frank Griffin (acting as \'Ruell Shayne\') landed some film jobs. Paget got a 20th Century-Fox contract at age 14 and her first role in the film noir Cry of the City (1948), her first of nearly 20 movies at the studio, mostly Westerns, swashbucklers and period musicals. Every inch (all five-foot-two of her) the Hollywood star, Paget retired from the screen after marrying a Chinese millionaire in 1962.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Tom Weaver <TomWeavr@aol.com>                    Debra Paget was born Debralee Griffin on August 19, 1933 in Denver Colorado.

At the age of fifteen Debra made her film debut in Cry Of The City. Her big break came when she was cast opposite James Stewart in the 1950 western Broken Arrow. She was offered a contract with Fox and quickly became one of their most popular stars. Debra starred in Princess of The Nile and had a supporting role in the Oscar winning The Ten Commandments. In 1956 she worked with Elvis Presley in the musical Love Me Tender. Elvis called Debra ""the most beautiful girl in the world"" but her mother would not allow them to date. Debra\'s first marriage, to singer David Street, was annulled after four months. She married director Budd Boetticher in 1960 but they divorced a year later. By this time her career had stalled and she decided to leave Hollywood. Her last role was in the 1963 horror film The Haunted Palace. Debra married Chinese oil executive Louis C. Kung in 1964 and had a son named Gregory. The couple divorced in 1980. Debra became a born again Christian and came out of retirement to host a religious show on the Trinity Broadcasting Network.

Kung was a Chinese-American oil company executive and a nephew of Madame Chiang.      Aunt of Roxane Griffin.      Never auditioned for The Ten Commandments (1956). The part of Lilia was the last of the lead roles to cast. Cecil B. DeMille instinctively asked her one day to report to Paramount to start work. He had followed her career and felt that ""the hand of God"" was on her.      Ex-aunt-in-law of Skip Crank.      Was originally going to star with Robert Wagner and Victor Mature in The Proud Ones (1956).

She was pleased when she found out that actress Debra Winger was named after her, since Winger\'s father was a fan of Paget\'s.Personal Quotes (16)      There\'s a difference in the morality [of today]. I don\'t want to be embarrassed when I go to see something on the screen. I don\'t want to listen to foul language, watch a lot of violence or see something immoral. I prefer stories with sensitivity and family values; films that strive to lift you up to a higher place in life. Those types of films are few and far between today. As a result, I seldom go to the movies.      [Twentieth Century Fox] was a wonderful place. It was like a separate little world of its own. I remember the huge buildings full of antique cars, stagecoaches and varied pieces of architecture. It was just incredible, and so much fun to wander through. There were New York, Western and Midwestern streets, a Roman square, the countryside...it was huge, and an extraordinary place.      [on a sexy seduction scene with Ron Randell in Most Dangerous Man Alive (1961)] This was a very unusual part for me, you know, and that was one reason I did it. It was kind of a veer-off from what I usually did.      [on having to wear brown contact lenses for her part in The Ten Commandments (1956)] I\'ve worn contacts three different times in movies, but they\'re awful to work in because the Kleig lights heat them up. I have to keep taking them off about every half hour, but they make my eyes the right color for [Cecil B. DeMille]. If it hadn\'t been for the lenses I wouldn\'t have gotten the part.      I was pleased to learn a contemporary actress, Debra Winger, was named after me.      I had gone into the theatre at about 9-10 years old and worked professionally from 11 on. I signed a contract at 20th Century Fox at 14. My mother was my agent. She had a lot of contacts and through her connections, I was signed. It kind of took your breath away at first. I was awe-struck. It took a while to come down off that cloud. I had to have a parent and a schoolteacher with me at all times.      My brother Frank Griffin used the name Ruell Shayne in [Love Me Tender (1956)]. He had a bit, but he did have a lead in Teen-Age Crime Wave (1955), He\'s done a western with Guy Madison [Bullwhip (1958)] and a cult science fiction film, The Giant Claw (1957). He\'s now a top make-up man.      [on working with James Stewart in Broken Arrow (1950)] I was so young that I was told, ""Don\'t ever tell him your age. Lie and say you\'re 17."" Well, I had a birthday on the set, and when Jimmy saw the number of candles, he screamed, ""Oh my God, I\'m a dirty old man!"" We had a lot of bad weather - it would wash away the set! We got way behind schedule, and Jimmy\'s fiancÃ©e, Gloria [Gloria Stewart], came up there. A week after we finished, they were married.      [on religion] I used to have a show on Trinity Broadcasting; I once did a seminar with Jacqueline White that was fun. We talked about the picture days. I do things for the Lord Jesus Christ - I give speeches, I write gospel songs and poems that are used when I speak.      [on testing for Broken Arrow (1950)] [James Stewart] took the time to test with us, which was not usually done at that time by major stars, they\'d have a contract player work with you. But he took all that time to work with Jeff Chandler and I which made a great deal of difference in our getting the parts. In a scene, if Jimmy thought Jeff, who was a gentle, quiet man, or I could do better, he would blow it and they\'d have to cut. And he\'d whisper to us, ""You can do this better...focus in"". He was just a beautiful human being. I want to cry, thinking about his recent passing. I loved that man, and I love that film. It was my first starring billing.      In 1982, I decided to go back to work. A newspaper reporter did a long story on me. Then I prayed about it, and decided not to do it. I did do a play, that was lots of fun, but I will never have a full-time acting career again.      [on Elvis Presley] Elvis and I did [Texaco Star Theatre Starring Milton Berle (1948)] three months before we did Love Me Tender (1956). I didn\'t notice Elvis because I had a tough dance number; my mother was there when we did it. Elvis did have a scene with [Milton Berle] that had something to do about me...and I may have come on at the end, I don\'t recall. I was more concerned with that crazy dance - I kept throwing my hip out - they had a woman on the set who pushed it back in! I just did the job and tried to stay out of pain!Three months later we did \'Love Me Tender.\' Originally, it had no songs. Elvis didn\'t want to sing, but they wanted to cash in, so he did sing in the movie. I didn\'t know Elvis was to do the picture until it was time to do the film. I was very shy, very quiet and very immature for my age. I was in my very early twenties but I was emotionally more like a 16-year-old. Elvis and I just sort of came together like a couple of children really. Following the film, he did ask me to marry him, but my parents objected to my getting married. I cared about Elvis, but being one not to disobey my parents, that did not take place. He was a precious, humble, lovely person. Elvis had a lot of talent; there was a lot of depth they never used. He could have been a fine actor.      [on the contact lenses she had to wear for Broken Arrow (1950)] The contact lenses were a problem. They weren\'t like they are today - not plastic, but *glass*! They covered the entire eye! They dyed the color in them. The light would heat them up and they dried the eyeball. You would sometimes be shot in profile, so only one contact had to be in your eye. The heat would turn that eye to hamburger. They were supposed to stay in 15 minutes, but it would turn into four hours! I\'d see rainbows for half an hour after taking them out. Once, when I put the contacts on a table by the shore, they fell into the river! The entire crew was on their knees feeling, trying to find the contact lenses. Finally, my mother had to send off for spares. I still have the originals - they are humdingers.      [on her sisters, Lisa Gaye and Teala Loring] I think Teala is the prettiest, then Lisa, then myself! Lisa has a quick, sharp wit about her, and a good sense of humor.      On Bird of Paradise (1951), there were 50 island girls hired to jump off a boat. They were not well-endowed, so the studio wanted to put pads or falsies in the sarongs. But the girls balked. They wouldn\'t let them be put in. Finally, they put them in themselves - and when the director called ""Action,"" they jumped off the boat and the falsies came off! From island to island, the story preceded us! They later called it Falsie Bay.      I was at Fox for two weeks when I did Cry of the City (1948) with Richard Conte and Victor Mature. They had shot the small part of a young 18-year-old, who had an innocent look about her, with two different actresses. They didn\'t like the results and decided to test three more. When I did the part, they liked what they saw, and I was kept after the six-month option period! I worked with Victor Mature in that when I was about 14 years old. I was so shy, terrified and insecure. He would put me on all the time. I didn\'t know it was a put on. I thought he was really mad at me. I\'d run to my dressing room and cry. He really wasn\'t being bad. I worked with him later and then I understood it was just a put on. But he knew how to get to you!    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nElvis Presley ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 302 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(5)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(10)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(225)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(36)\xa0|Salary\xa0(24)  Overview (5)Date of Birth8\xa0January1935,\xa0Tupelo, Mississippi, USA Date of Death16\xa0August1977,\xa0Memphis, Tennessee, USA      \xa0(cardiac arrhythmia)    Birth NameElvis Aron PresleyNicknamesThe PelvisThe KingThe King of Rock \'n\' Roll    Height5\'\xa011Â¾""\xa0(1.82\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935 in East Tupelo, Mississippi, to Gladys Presley (nÃ©e Gladys Love Smith) and Vernon Presley (Vernon Elvis Presley). He had a twin brother who was stillborn. In September 1948, Elvis and his parents moved to Memphis, Tennessee where he attended Humes High School. In 1953, he attended the senior prom with the current girl he was courting, Regis Wilson. After graduating from high school in Memphis, Elvis took odd jobs working as a movie theater usher and a truck driver for Crown Electric Company. He began singing locally as ""The Hillbilly Cat"", then signed with a local recording company, and then with RCA in 1955.Elvis did much to establish early rock and roll music. He began his career as a performer of rockabilly, an up-tempo fusion of country music and rhythm and blues, with a strong backbeat. His novel versions of existing songs, mixing \'black\' and \'white\' sounds, made him popular - and controversial - as did his uninhibited stage and television performances. He recorded songs in the rock and roll genre, with tracks like ""Jailhouse Rock"" and ""Hound Dog"" later embodying the style. Presley had a versatile voice and had unusually wide success encompassing other genres, including gospel, blues, ballads and pop music. Teenage girls became hysterical over his blatantly sexual gyrations, particularly the one that got him nicknamed ""Elvis the Pelvis"" (television cameras were not permitted to film below his waist).In 1956, following his six television appearances on The Dorsey Brothers\' ""Stage Show"", Elvis was cast in his first acting role, in a supporting part in Love Me Tender (1956), the first of 33 movies he starred in.In 1958, Elvis was drafted into the military, and relocated to Bad Nauheim, Germany. There he met and fell in love with 14-year old army damsel Priscilla Ann Wagner (Priscilla Presley), whom he would eventually marry after an eight-year courtship, and with whom he had his only child, Lisa Marie Presley. Elvis\' military service and the ""British Invasion"" of the 1960s reduced his concerts, though not his movie/recording income.Through the 1960s, Elvis settled in Hollywood, where he starred in the majority of his thirty-three movies, mainly musicals, acting alongside some of the most well known actors in Hollywood. Critics panned most of his films, but they did very well at the box office, earning upwards of $150 million total. His last fiction film, Change of Habit (1969), deals with several social issues; romance within the clergy, an autistic child, almost unheard of in 1969, rape, and mob violence. It has recently received critical acclaim.Elvis made a comeback in the 1970s with live concert appearances starting in early 1970 in Las Vegas with over 57 sold-out shows. He toured throughout the United States, appearing on-stage in over 500 live appearances, many of them sold out shows. His marriage ended in divorce, and the stress of constantly traveling as well as his increasing weight gain and dependence upon stimulants and depressants took their toll.Elvis Presley died at age 42 on August 16, 1977 at his mansion in Graceland, near Memphis, shocking his fans worldwide. At the time of his death, he had sold more than 600 million singles and albums. Since his death, Graceland has become a shrine for millions of followers worldwide. Elvis impersonators and purported sightings have become stock subjects for humorists. To date, Elvis Presley is the only performer to have been inducted into three separate music \'Halls of Fame\'. Throughout his career, he set records for concert attendance, television ratings and recordings sales, and remains one of the best-selling and most influential artists in the history of popular music.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Ed Stephan and Chris Holland          Spouse (1) Priscilla Presley (1 May\xa01967            - 9 October\xa01973)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)          Trade Mark (10)        The famous left-sided grin        His movements, with his pelvis, that gave him the nickname, ""Elvis, the pelvis"", which he strongly disliked        Longer and slightly deeper sideburns        White sequined jumpsuits with rhinestones        Onstage karate moves        Peanut butter and banana sandwiches (with bacon)        Two trademark phrases were ""Thank ya!"" and ""Thank ya\' very much!""

His twin brother, Jesse Garon Presley, died at birth. Elvis was successfully delivered, approximately 35 minutes later.      Earned a black belt in karate in 1960.      Won three Grammy Awards, all for his gospel music.      His hair color was blonde until his early teens. As he got older his hair became darker. By the time he had his hair cut for the army at age 22 its natural color was dark chestnut (according to Charlie Hodge, who served with him in the army).      Was originally considered for the Kris Kristofferson role in A Star Is Born (1976), but Elvis turned it down because his manager, Tom Parker, refused him permission to act in a movie where he wouldn\'t have top billing. Also, he didn\'t like the fact that the producer, Jon Peters, was completely unknown.      Owned a pet chimpanzee called ""Scatter"".      Has more multi-platinum album sales than any other performer, with 12 albums selling over two million copies.      Father of Lisa Marie Presley (birthdate, Thursday, February 1st, 1968).      Interred at Graceland Estate, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.      His autopsy detected ten different drugs in his bloodstream.      Is a direct descendant of Abraham Lincoln\'s great-great grandfather, Isaiah Harrison.      Had 18 Billboard #1 songs, the first being ""Heartbreak Hotel"" in March of 1956. His 18th and final #1, ""Suspicious Minds"", was released in September 1969.      When The Beatles came to America in 1965 there was only one person they wanted to meet: Elvis. On Friday, August 27, 1965, they got their wish and, according to John Lennon, spent an entirely enjoyable evening at the Presley home in Bel Air, California, talking, singing and laughing with each other.      He bought Graceland mansion on Tuesday, March 19, 1957, from Mrs. Ruth Brown Moore for $102,500. The mansion, built of tan Tennessee limestone, consists of 23 rooms and 13.7 surrounding acres. The Music Gates were installed in April of 1957. The name ""Graceland"" came with the mansion, from the days when it was originally used as a church.      His television debut was on the regionally telecast Louisiana Hayride (1955), Saturday, March 5th, 1955 in Shreveport, Louisiana.      In September 1955, ""Country Song Roundup"" magazine was the first to feature an article on Elvis, calling him a ""folk music fireball"".      In April of 1955 Elvis auditioned for a spot on Arthur Godfrey\'s Talent Scouts (1948) and was turned down.      Elvis\' body was placed in a family crypt in Memphis on Thursday, August 18, 1977. Eleven days later, however, an attempt was made to steal his body but the plan failed and three men were charged with trespassing and released on bond. Because of this incident, Vernon Presley, received approval from the Memphis Adjustment Board to allow re-interment of the bodies of Elvis and his mother, Gladys Presley to the Meditation Garden behind Graceland, which took place, on Sunday, October 2, 1977.      The book he was reading at the time of his death was ""The Scientific Search for the Face of Jesus"" by Frank O. Adams, (Psychical Aid Foundation, USA, 1972).      From the time they met up until his death, Elvis always sent a roomful of flowers to Ann-Margret whenever she opened up a show in Las Vegas.      Was one of the performers featured on a set of stamps of rock and blues legends issued by the U.S. Postal Service in June 1993.      His mother, Gladys Presley, gave him his first guitar in 1947, when he was 12 years old, as a birthday present.      He was a 1953 graduate of Humes High School, in Memphis, Tennessee.      Was one of the first people in the U.S. to own a ""Betamax"" system VCR      Honorary Member of Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity.      After seeing him in concert, Liberace suggested adding flashy costumes to his act. Elvis took the advice, and became famous for his gold lame jackets and jeweled white jumpsuits. He later reserved a seat for Liberace at a majority of his concerts, as his way of saying thanks.      One of only a handful of artists inducted into both The Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame and The Country Music Hall of Fame. Others include Johnny Cash and Hank Williams.      Died with about $5 million in his bank account.      Elvis did not like confrontation. He wanted to fire his manager, Tom Parker, many times. He would tell his friends ""Tell Parker, he\'s fired."" His friends would go tell him, then Parker would say ""Tell Elvis to tell me personally"". Elvis never did.      ""Heartbreak Hotel"", which spent 17 weeks at #1 on Billboard\'s country chart (and 10 weeks on Billboard\'s Hot 100) was the #1 country song of 1956.      Inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1998.      His 1977 country hit, ""Way Down,"" was the #1 song on Billboard magazine\'s country singles chart the week of Elvis\' death. Nine other songs would go to #1 on Billboard\'s country charts between 1956 and 1981: ""I Forgot to Remember to Forget,"" ""Heartbreak Hotel,"" ""I Want You, I Need You, I Love You,"" and the two-sided #1 hit ""Hound Dog/Don\'t Be Cruel"" (all 1956); ""All Shook Up,"" ""(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear"" and ""Jailhouse Rock"" (all 1957); ""Moody Blue"" (1977); and ""Guitar Man"" (1981, a remixed version released more than three years after his death). Most of his 1950s #1 country hits were also #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 as well.      In Sam Lovullo\'s book ""Life in the Kornfield"", which recalled his years as producer of 1969\'s country music TV series Hee Haw (1969), he remarked that Elvis was a big fan of the show and had always wanted to perform on it. However, according to Lovullo, Elvis remarked they\'d have to tape his spots in the middle of the night, knowing that if manager Tom Parker had found out, he\'d never clear his appearance. Several months after Elvis\' death, his father, Vernon Presley, appeared on ""Hee Haw"" and spoke about how the world would always love him and remember his music.      Hysteria over ""Elvis sightings"" after his death were lampooned in the Mojo Nixon song ""Elvis Is Everywhere"" and ""Elvis Is Dead"" by Living Colour.      His personal entourage were known as the ""Memphis Mafia"", and were given matching rings by Elvis. The diamond and gold rings sported a thunderbolt and the letters ""TCB"" (reportedly standing for ""Take Care of Business""). Elvis was buried wearing one of the rings.      Pictured on a 29Â¢ US commemorative postage stamp issued on Friday, January 8th, 1993, 58 years after his birthdate. This was the inaugural issue in the Legends of American Music series.      In 2002 a re-mixed version of one his more obscure recordings, ""A Little Less Conversation"", became a dance club hit, and topped the charts in the United Kingdom.      The lightest Elvis ever weighed, as an adult, was 170 pounds in 1960, following his discharge from the U.S. Army. The heaviest was at the time of his death, which was 260 pounds. He gained 90 pounds in his final 17 years of life.      Was always known to be generous to a fault with family, friends and even total strangers. Anyone who admired any posession of his, from one of his many Cadillacs to any bit of bric-a-brac in his home, often found themselves the new owners of that posession.      Inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame (sponsored by the Gospel Music Association) in 2001.      Made the first ever musical video of all time: Jailhouse Rock (1957).      When Ed Sullivan finally allowed him to appear on Toast of the Town (1948), he was filmed from the waist upwards only once, on his third and final appearance on Sunday, January 6th, 1957.      His 1960 single ""It\'s Now Or Never"" is one of the best selling singles of all time--if not the all-time best selling single--with sales estimated to have been between 25 and 30 million copies.      He is responsible for the best selling single of the 1950s (""Hound Dog/Don\'t Be Cruel"", 1956) and that of the 1960s (""It\'s Now Or Never"", 1960).      His 29Â¢ commemorative postage stamp issued in 1993, sold more copies than any other postage stamp in U.S. Postal Service history.      A remix of his song ""A Little Less Conversation"" was featured on the soundtrack to the film Ocean\'s Eleven (2001) and became a Billboard #1 hit single, over 20 years after his death.The Beatles were admirers of his work and, although John Lennon said they enjoyed his company very much, Elvis himself, ironically, thought that they were a bad influence on America\'s youth.      Elvis was descended from a woman named Morning White Dove (she was his maternal great-great-great-grandmother two times over). Morning White Dove is believed by some to have been a Cherokee Native American, although it is not clear if documentary evidence exists that she was a Native American. Elvis\' character in G.I. Blues (1960) has a Cherokee background.      He was allegedly offered roles in The Rainmaker (1956), The Defiant Ones (1958), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), West Side Story (1961), Sweet Bird of Youth (1962), The Fastest Guitar Alive (1967), Midnight Cowboy (1969), True Grit (1969), Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971), A Star Is Born (1976) and Grease (1978).      He said that his favorite of all his films was King Creole (1958). He also said his film that he disliked the most was Clambake (1967).      During his third and final appearance on Ed Sullivan\'s Toast of the Town (1948) weekly program, on Sunday, January 6, 1957, he angered Sullivan by singing the gospel song ""Peace In The Valley"" on his show, after Sullivan asked him not to.      He was a distant cousin of former US President Jimmy Carter (1977-81). When Elvis died on Tuesday, August 16, 1977, Carter said the next day, ""Elvis Presley\'s death deprived our country of a part of itself. He was unique and irreplaceable"".      He was temporarily a Shelby County (Tennessee) deputy sheriff.Hal B. Wallis, producer of eight of his films, wanted to make a western with Elvis and John Wayne, but it never came about.      In 1973 he met with Led Zeppelin members Robert Plant and John Paul Jones in Los Angeles. An idol to the members of Led Zeppelin, Elvis wanted to meet ""who was outselling him"" at concerts (Zeppelin was in the midst of a record-breaking tour that year). A meeting was arranged with Plant and Jones. Plant was so awestruck at meeting his idol in person that he could barely speak to him. Jones, nearly as awestruck as Plant, made small talk with the ""King,"" and mentioned what a beautiful watch Elvis wore. Elvis, always the generous one, instantly traded his $5,000 gold and diamond watch for Jones\' $10 Mickey Mouse watch. This broke the ice with all of them, and they became fast friends. Throughout the early 1970s members of Led Zeppelin even attended a few of Elvis\' concerts, and were granted the privilege of sitting in the front row by the King himself.      He named his four personal favorite films as: Rebel Without a Cause (1955), A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), Dirty Harry (1971) and Bullitt (1968).      He was drafted into the US Army in 1958, stationed in West Germany and discharged in 1960, achieving the rank of sergeant. His being in the army was a public relations headache, according to army documents released by the Pentagon on Thursday, June 9, 2005. ""Elvis Presley will not be released in a manner different from any other inductee serving overseas,"" the Army\'s adjutant general wrote to citizens who complained following reports that the rock icon would get an early ""good behavior"" discharge. When he entered the army at Memphis, Tennessee, on March 24, 1958, there was a public outcry from his fans, and protests flowed to Washington, including a hand-written plea released by the National Archives and Records Administration. ""Dear Mamie,"" one correspondent wrote to then First Lady Mamie Eisenhower. ""Will you please, please be so sweet and kind as to ask Ike [President Dwight D. Eisenhower] to please bring Elvis Presley back to us from the Army? We need him in our entertainment world to make us all laugh."" A 1959 Army memo set out the Presley problem: ""When Private First Class Presley was first inducted, there was considerable adverse public reaction . . . alleging that he would receive preferential treatment in the Army. This impression has been largely replaced by a public impression of a good soldier serving his military obligation . . . Many teenagers who look up to and emulate Private First Class Presley will . . . follow his example in the performance of their military service"".      On Monday, December 21, 1970, he paid a visit to President Richard Nixon at the White House in Washington, D.C. The meeting was initiated by Presley, who wrote Nixon a six-page letter requesting a visit with the President and suggesting that he be made a ""Federal Agent-at-Large"" in the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.      More people watched Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii (1973) (live via satellite TV broadcast)--the first of its kind--than watched astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin as they landed and then walked on the moon on July 20, 1969. Interestingly, the US audience didn\'t view this concert event live. It was seen by much of the world on January 14, 1973. The US audience had to wait almost three months, as it was telecast for the first time in the US on April 14, 1973. Several songs recorded by Elvis in a studio while he was in Hawaii were added. The concert was preceded, on NBC, by an Ann-Margret special.      He only performed two concerts outside of the United States of America. Both of them were in Canada. Therefore, all of his concerts were in North America.      Son of Vernon Presley and Gladys Presley.      Recorded 33 takes of ""Hound Dog"".      His favorite sports were racquetball and football.      He temporarily passed out from exhaustion, after recording ""If I Can Dream"".      After production of his 1968 NBC television special he told producer Steve Binder he would never make another movie or song he didn\'t believe in.      Once sent $1,000,000 to Buford Pusser, the crimefighting Tennessee sheriff who was the subject of the 1973 film Walking Tall (1973).      Once gave a robe to Muhammad Ali. On the back of the robe was stitched ""The Peoples Champion"", which was Presley\'s nickname for Ali.      His favorite actors were Marlon Brando and James Dean. In a 1956 interview he said that he considered Dean an acting genius.      His two favorite books were ""The Holy Bible"" and ""The Impersonal Life"".      His favorite class in high school was wood shop.      His mansion, Graceland, is the second most-visited place in United States of America. The first is the White House.Elia Kazan had expressed interest several times in casting Elvis in his films, Elvis\' manager Tom Parker refused to allow it.      Last film he saw in a theater was The Spy Who Loved Me (1977).      He tried to get a print of Star Wars (1977) to show his daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, his last full day of life, on Monday, August 15th, 1977.      He is referenced in the work of other music artists. He is mentioned in the songs ""That Don\'t Impress Me Much"" by Shania Twain, ""Without Me"" by Eminem (as well as spoofed in the music video) and ""Three Minute Boy"" by Marillion.      He was on the school boxing team while attending Humes High School in Memphis, TN.      Loved football and often had three TVs set up at Graceland to watch all of the games in progress at the same time.      He used to play touch football at Whitehaven High School during the \'60s and early \'70s with kids around the neighborhood.      Helped to support an All-Negro Day at the Memphis Zoo in 1956.      In 1975 he purchased a poor black East Memphis woman an electric wheelchair and picked her up and personally sat her in it. The woman\'s teenage daughter told Elvis she liked his car. He gave it to her and even gave her boyfriend a job.      He was a fervent admirer of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King and had hoped to meet him in 1966, but the meeting never occurred. Many observers believed that was because his manager, Tom Parker, didn\'t want to alienate Elvis\' fans in the South, many of whom saw King as an ""outside agitator"" because of his civil-rights work among Southern blacks.      Was a huge fan of the television shows The Jeffersons (1975), Good Times (1974), Happy Days (1974) and Flip (1970).      Once an opera singer attended one of his 1950s concerts and met him backstage. The singer told Elvis that he sang like a hillbilly and needed singing lessons. Elvis replied, ""Thanks for the advice, but how many of the thousands of people out there tonight came to hear you sing?"".      One set of genealogical research states that his surname was Anglicized from the German ""Pressler"" during the Civil War, and that his ancestor was Johann Valentin Pressler, who emigrated to North America in 1710. Pressler first settled in New York but later moved to the South. Jaime Pressly is also descended from him. Elvis also had English, Scottish, distant French, Dutch, Danish and--possible but unverified--Native American ancestry (through his descent from Morning White Dove, who was Elvis\' great-great-great-grandmother twice over).      Shown on a 5.50 kr postage stamp issued by Sweden in 2004.      He was the #1 touring act in America for 1977; the year he died. This, despite the fact that he was well below par and only toured until July, is quite an achievement.      Held the world indoor attendance record for a concert. At the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit on December 31, 1975, 62,500 fans attended. The show also set a record for the biggest box-office take for a single show: $850,000.      Held a single day\'s attendance record for his March 1974 shows at the Houston Astrodome--89,000 fans for two shows.      According to a show on the A&E; Biography channel, he once attended a concert for singer Connie Francis and had to leave for emotional reasons once he heard her sing the old Italian song ""Mama"", as his mother, Gladys Presley had recently died.      Lived with Linda Thompson for 4-1/2 years, from 1972-6. She was a former ""Miss Tennessee,"" actress and songwriter. Other than Priscilla Presley, Thompson was the most significant romantic relationship Elvis ever had.      When he was an infant a tornado struck his hometown of Tupelo, Mississippi. He and his family survived uninjured, but 233 people in the city were killed and hundreds were injured.      Suffered from chronic insomnia.      His tombstone gives his name as ""Elvis Aaron Presley"", whereas he was in fact named ""Elvis Aron Presley"". Although this fueled conspiracy theories that he had faked his death, it is generally believed he changed his middle name so it would be the same as Biblical person, Aaron, (brother of Moses).      Had glaucoma in the 1970s.      At the time of his death in 1977, he was the second best-selling recording artist of all time, second only to longtime successful crooner, Bing Crosby.      He was a born-again Christian who loved to sing gospel music.      None of his 33 films, 31 features and two musical documentaries were ever nominated for an Academy Award. Of his 31 feature films only one, Wild in the Country (1961), lost money.      He had two full face-lifts and rhinoplasty during the mid-1970s. On one of these visits to hospital he was accompanied by Linda Thompson.      He worked with legendary guitar player Hank Garland from 1957-61.      Was director Robert Wise\'s original choice to play Tony in West Side Story (1961).      He was portrayed by Jason Alan Smith in Crazy (2008).      Nephew of Vester Presley.      Most of the films he starred in were not critically acclaimed, although he received good reviews for Flaming Star (1960) and King Creole (1958).      In the month following his final concert, at Indianapolis, Indiana, on Sunday, June 26, 1977, he was reported to have gained an extra 50 pounds.      Is portrayed by Val Kilmer in True Romance (1993). Like Presley, Kilmer is also said to have possible Cherokee heritage.      Of his many numerous impersonators, his personal favorite was Andy Kaufman.      Prior to being signed by RCA in November 1955, Elvis was known as ""The Hillbilly Cat"" in his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee.      Is portrayed by Michael St. Gerard in Great Balls of Fire! (1989)      His song ""Heartbreak Hotel"" is based on a note left by a man who committed suicide in a Florida hotel suite. When Elvis first performed the song on Stage Show (1954) in 1956, he sang the words ""They\'re so lonely they pray to die"". This was changed in later performances from ""pray to die"" to ""they could die"" so as not to offend the religious establishment with a reference for a prayer for death.      Elvis topped the Forbes Magazine list of deceased highest earners for the fourth consecutive year, with earnings of $45 million in 2004.      In 1977 alone his personal physician, Dr. George Nichopoulos (usually referred to as ""Dr. Nick""), had prescribed at least 10,000 hits of amphetamines, barbiturates, narcotics, tranquilizers, sleeping pills, laxatives and hormones for Presley. His medical license was later revoked for prescribing such huge amounts of drugs.Barbra Streisand originally wanted Elvis to play the role of John Norman Howard in A Star Is Born (1976), but the studio couldn\'t meet Tom Parker\'s demands ($1 million plus equal billing with Streisand).      Elvis dreamed of playing Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather (1972), but when he asked to audition for the part he was turned down.      One of his biggest hit songs, ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"", was written in 1926 by Lou Handman and Roy Turk and first recorded by Lou\'s sister Edith Handman with Lou at the piano. Vaughn Deleath and The Colonial Club Orchestra released a version of the song in 1927 that became a hit. \'The Carter Family\' recorded a bluegrass version with additional verses in 1936. The first charted version was by Blue Barron in 1950 (#16 US Pop), which introduced the spoken portion, modeled after Jacques\' ""All The World\'s A Stage"" speech in William Shakespeare\'s ""As You Like It"". Al Jolson recorded that version several weeks later. Additionaly, it was singer Jaye P. Morgan\'s 1959 (#65 US Pop) version of the song, as well as Blue Barron\'s earlier 1950 version, that Elvis heard while in Germany that influenced him to record the song shortly after his discharge from the army. Elvis\' 1960 version of ""Are You Lonesome Tonight"" is closest to the 1950 Blue Barron recording.      He was an avid collector of guns and badges.      In 1981, Kirsty MacColl had a number 14 single in the UK with the song ""There\'s a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop Swears He\'s Elvis"". He also inspired the song ""Elvis Ate America"" on the album ""Original Soundtracks 1"" by Passengers, which was a U2 and Brian Eno side project in 1995.      Once claimed Robert Mitchum was the inspiration for his famous hairstyle. Presley met Mitchum to discuss the possibility of starring together in Thunder Road (1958), but unfortunately Tom Parker\'s demands for Presley\'s salary could not be met.      He was portrayed by Peter Dobson in Forrest Gump (1994).      Along with Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins, Elvis was a member of the celebrated ""Million Dollar Quartet"", so named because they were money-makers for Sam Phillips\' Sun Records label.      Newspaper reports indicated that Sammy Davis Jr., Farrah Fawcett, Burt Reynolds and John Wayne were supposed to attend Presley\'s funeral, but they did not turn up. Ann-Margret, James Brown and George Hamilton were the only celebrities in attendance.      He was seriously considered for the role of the Texas Ranger in True Grit (1969) starring John Wayne. Unfortunately, Tom Parker\'s demand that Presley receive top billing could not be met, so the part went to Glen Campbell instead.      He was offered a role in the animation film, Gay Purr-ee (1962), but disliked the roles of off-screen voice acting.      His autopsy detected 14 different drugs in his bloodstream, ten in significant quantity.      His home Graceland in Memphis is the second most popular private tourist attraction in the United States after the White House, and is estimated to bring in $150 million to the city itself each year.      Named the highest earning deceased celebrity for the sixth consecutive year in 2006 by Forbes.com.      He was considered for Ricky Nelson\'s role in Rio Bravo (1959) starring John Wayne and Dean Martin. However, by the time filming began in May 1958 Presley was stationed with the US army in Germany.      He is credited as a co-writer of ""(I\'ll) You\'ll Be Gone"" (1965). This was the B side of the hit from his film Girl Happy (1965), ""Do The Clam"". It is found in his five-CD box set of \'60s recordings. Elvis composed the lyrics and brought the song to a recording session.      In 1973 he was the biggest taxpayer in the US.      It was estimated that he earned earned $4.5 billion in his lifetime.      With a lot of entertainers making a living mimicking Elvis, Jimmy Buffett wrote a song called ""Elvis Imitators"" making mention of a few of Elvis\' films, song titles, and mannerisms.      Has sold 1.8 billion records worldwide, more than any other artist or music group.      He was discovered by Sun Records owner Sam Phillips.      On Thursday, November 11th, 2004, he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame for his outstanding contribution to British music and integral part of British music culture.      His parents Vernon Presley and Gladys Presley were unemployed during the Great Depression of the 1930s and lived on welfare and then on Social Security after it was created during the administration of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt.      In 1970 he wrote to J. Edgar Hoover requesting to join the FBI at the height of its campaign against political protests in the United States.      Met President Lyndon Johnson at the White House in 1965.      Has been portrayed by Val Kilmer, Harvey Keitel, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Kurt Russell, Don Johnson, Bruce Campbell, David Keith, Rob Youngblood, Peter Dobson and Scott Bakula.      The very last song he sang in public was ""Can\'t Help Falling In Love"", at The Market Square Arena in Indianapolis, Indiana, on Sunday, June 26, 1977.      He did an early \'60s concert in Hawaii, and donated the proceeds to help build the USS Arizona memorial.      Turned down the leading role in The Fastest Guitar Alive (1967), which went to his friend Roy Orbison.      In 2007 the National Rifle Association (NRA) released an Elvis Presley Tribute Revolver, officially authorized by his estate.      After his concert in Hawaii in 1961, Presley concentrated on making movies and did not perform before a live audience again for seven years until his 1968 TV special and subsequent return to Las Vegas in 1969.      He was ranked #2 on VH1\'s 100 Sexiest Artists and #8 on VH1\'s 100 Greatest Artists of Rock & Roll. He was voted best singer of all time by Q Magazine. He was voted the 3rd Greatest Rock \'n\' Roll Artist of all time by Rolling Stone magazine.      As a young man, Elvis idolized a gospel group called The Statesmen. According to Elvis\' backup singer and lifelong friend Joe Moscheo, Elvis\' leg-twitching dance moves were inspired by The Statesmen\'s bass singer, ""Big Chief"" Wetherington, who was famous for his leg twitching.      Between 1957-69 he performed only two concerts and made just two television appearances.      In 1962 he ceased almost completely to record non-soundtrack songs until his 1969 album ""From Elvis in Memphis"".      In July of 2005, Presley was named one of the top 100 ""Greatest Americans,"" following a vote organized by Discovery Channel. In the vote, Presley ranked ahead of all entertainers and in 8th place behind Presidents Ronald Reagan, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, plus Martin Luther King and Benjamin Franklin.      His records have spent a total of 79 weeks at the #1 position on the US charts.      His records have spent 2,574 weeks in both the UK singles and album charts, were and still are way ahead of his closest competitors Cliff Richard (1,982), Queen (1,755), The Beatles (1,749) and Madonna (1,660).      He was planning his first ever European tour in 1978.      In Alexandria, Louisiana, early in 1977 a local journalist complained that the singer was on stage for less than an hour and ""was impossible to understand."" In Baton Rouge, Presley didn\'t go on stage at all. He was unable to get out of his hotel bed and the rest of the tour was canceled.      Investor CKX paid $100 million for an 85% interest in Presley\'s income in February 2005.Robbie Williams dedicated his song ""Advertising Space"" to him.      He is credited as a co-writer of ""(I\'ll) You\'ll Be Gone"" (1965). This was the B side of the hit from his film Girl Happy (1965), ""Do The Clam"". It is found in his five-CD box set of \'60s recordings. Elvis composed the lyrics and brought the song to a recording session. He is also listed in the writer\'s credits to ""Heartbreak Hotel"".      His favorite actors were James Dean, John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and Marlon Brando. Brando personally strongly disliked Presley.      He was mentioned in Walter Kirn\'s novel, ""Thumbsucker"".      Was a fan of actors Peter Sellers and Tony Curtis.      On seeing Elvis in rehearsal for Stage Show (1954) Jackie Gleason--the show\'s producer--described Elvis as ""Marlon Brando with a guitar"".      Was the first entertainer to introduce karate in an American motion picture (Flaming Star (1960)).      While he never joined any political party, his political views were somewhat mixed. During the early 1960s he was an outspoken admirer of liberal President John F. Kennedy. He later confessed to ""weeping openly"" at the news of Kennedy\'s death. Later in life, however, he made a more conservative move on the political spectrum. He began singing the praises of President Richard Nixon, and his right-wing streak culminated in a visit to the White House in December 1970. During the visit, Presley was photographed giving the President a handgun, which was (for security reasons) presented but not given. Presley spoke of his admiration for Nixon, revealed his disgust at the hippie counterculture, spoke disparagingly of The Beatles (he said that having earned their money in America, they had then left for England to promote ""anti-American"" feelings), fervently expressed his patriotism, offered to infiltrate and go undercover in left-wing hippie groups, asked to be appointed a federal narcotics agent, and even hugged the president twice. Nixon, for his part, was not sure if Presley was serious or not, but granted his request and made him an honorary federal agent. Nixon said he was equally parts bewildered and amused by the encounter, thanked Presley for his support, and the picture of the duo has become one of the most famous photos taken in the White House. On Presley\'s death in 1977, the former president asked Americans to lower their flags all over the country as a mark of respect.      Elvis was a good friend of Johnny Cash, going back to their Sun Records\' days recordings, after being discovered by Sam Phillips.      Voted the third greatest singer of the rock era in a Rolling Stone magazine poll in 2008.      Elvis\' original combo (Elvis, Scotty Moore and Bill Black) were nicknamed and known as ""The Blue Moon Boys featuring that Hillbilly Cat"" after their popular rendition of Bill Monroe\'s ""Blue Moon Of Kentucky"". Moore acted as Elvis\' first manager. Black in the late \'40s was a member of Gene Krupa\'s band and later had a successful recording career with Bill Black\'s Combo.      The last song he sang was ""Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain"", at home, and playing the piano, to family and friends, Monday evening, August 15th, 1977.      According to Elvis and his manager Tom Parker, Elvis\' return to TV in 1968 was in part due to NBC (Universal Pictures) agreeing to finance the remaining movies he was scheduled to make.      In 1953 while working as an usher in a local Memphis movie theater he sang, by request, ""That\'s Amore"" on stage.      He unsuccessfully auditioned for CBS\' Talent Scouts (1948) nine months before his successful debut on Stage Show (1954). The trip to New York City for the audition was not a complete loss for Elvis. That same day he went uptown to see Bo Diddley, who was appearing at The Apollo.      In 1955 he appeared in a rock documentary, The Pied Piper of Cleveland: A Day in the Life of a Famous Disc Jockey (1955), about Cleveland DJ Bill Randle, filmed in various locations in the Cleveland, Ohio, area (mainly Brooklyn High School). The film headlined many top acts of the day including Bill Haley and the Comets, Pat Boone, The Four Lads and others. This film has yet to be released. It is still reportedly the property of Polygram International and in the Universal vault.      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6777 Hollywood Boulevard for Recording in Hollywood, California.      His funeral procession on August 18, 1977, consisted of 49 cars led by 11 white Cadillacs--Cadillac was his favorite car.      His live performance of ""My Way"" done early in his 1977 tour and featured on his October 1977 TV special was a million-selling single following his death.      Many Elvis fans and historians agree that his 1969 recording sessions at American International Studios in Memphis were among his greatest work--it contained songs in a variety of musical genres, from pop to country/western to R&B; to standards, in addition to new material.      Four grandchildren: Riley Keough (b. May 29, 1989), Benjamin Keough (b. October 21, 1992) and twin girls Harper Vivienne Ann & Finley Aaron Love Lockwood (b. October 7, 2008).      During his 21-year association with RCA Records (1956-77), the only year he failed to have a single in the Billboard Top Pop 20 was 1967.      He is not related to Reg Presley (b: Reginald Maurice Ball), the lead singer of the popular British rock band The Troggs, which had 2 million sellers of their own, ""Wild Thing"" (1966) and ""Love Is All Around"" (1968).      Owned a collection of Andy Kaufman tapes.      During the 1970s he had 28 singles reach the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Posthumously, he had a #1 single on the Hot 100 in 2002 with the remix of ""A Little Less Conversation"".      Both his father Vernon Presley and grandmother Minnie Mae outlived him. Vernon died in 1979 at age 63 and Minnie Mae died in 1980 at age 90.      Former wife Priscilla Presley opened up their home Graceland to the public on June 7, 1982. Elvis\' Aunt Delta remained living on the estate until her death in 1993.      Bought former US President Franklin D. Roosevelt\'s yacht ""Potomac"" for $55,000 in January 1964.      According to Tommy Steele, Presley did visit London once in 1958. However, this has not been substantiated.      He asked his father Vernon Presley to pick TV evangelist Rex Humbard to officiate at his funeral.      His death on August 16, 1977, was 29 years after baseball athlete and first home-run king, Babe Ruth\'s death, August 16, 1948 and 21 years after actor, Bela Lugosi, August 16, 1956.      Reports of the last words spoken by Elvis vary. He ended his last press conference with the words: ""I hope I haven\'t bored you."" Other reports say his last words were: ""Okay, I won\'t"" (The last words spoken to Ginger Alden, his girlfriend at the time of his death, who told him on the way to the bathroom not to ""fall asleep in there."").      Elvis owned one of the world\'s first mobile phones. He had to have one after seeing Sean Connery use a car phone in the James Bond movie From Russia with Love (1963). Elvis\'s phone was contained in a suitcase-size carrying case with his name in black letters on a gold label on the front. He would use it to talk from his limousine.      Was a huge fan of professional wrestling.      His last film, Change of Habit (1969), had him as a doctor in an urban clinic, reflecting his attempt to be ""relevant"" to the social activism of the youth of the \'60s. Additionally, this film dealt with what was then considered to be medical treatment of an ""autistic"" child, a topic almost unheard of in 1969.      After not having a Top 20 hit single since 1966, Elvis\' Nov. 68 ""comeback"" TV Special spawned the now standard ""If I Can Dream"", (#13 US Pop). This was followed in 1969 by ""Memories"" (#35 US Pop), which was also performed on the Special, ""In The Ghetto"" (#3 US Pop), ""Suspicious Minds"" (#1 US Pop), and ""Don\'t Cry Daddy"" (#6 US Pop).      On his first appearance on Stage Show (1954) on Jan. 28, 1956, he sang a medley of ""Shake Rattle and Roll"" / ""Flip Flop and Fly"" and later performed ""I Got A Woman"". That breakthrough performance of ""I Got A Woman"", to a startled 1956 audience, had not been seen for years, but as of 2010 it is available on YouTube.      He and Andy Griffith debuted together, but at different times, on Steve Allen\'s weekly program The Steve Allen Show (1956), on July 1, 1956. It was Steve Allen\'s second show and Elvis\' appearance skyrocketed it in popularity.      While Elvis appeared on NBC\'s The Steve Allen Show (1956), on Sunday, July 1, 1956. his manager Colonel Tom Parker was contacted by Ed Sullivan about Elvis appearing on Sullivan\'s weekly CBS variety show, Toast of the Town (1948), on CBS. Elvis was signed for a then staggering $50,000 for three appearances. This was quite an accomplishment--or lack of foresight--as Sullivan and Allen were broadcast in the same Sunday-evening time slot and had an ongoing ""ratings war"" against each other. Even more amazing was that Elvis\' prestigious record label, RCA Victor, was a subsidiary of the corporation that owned NBC. The NBC logo at that time was the famous RCA Color (TV) Peacock. Elvis already had sold at least five million records for RCA. Allen would later state that his reason for ""giving away"" Elvis was that he ran strictly a comedy show. Ironically. the following summer Allen hosted Jerry Lee Lewis twice. After this, Sullivan was not as interested in biding for Lewis as he was for Elvis. Lewis did not appear on Sullivan\'s show until 1969.      An earlier take of Elvis\' 1956 hit ""I Want You, I Need You,I Love You"" is titled ""I Need You, I Want You, I Love You"". This earlier version of the song appeared on some copies of his debut album titled ""Elvis"" and was later issued in a 1977 compilation package..      The media coverage of his death overshadowed that of the 86-year-old comedian and film star Groucho Marx, which occurred three days later.      In the mid-\'70s he was approached to help finance a karate movie called ""New Gladiators"" in which he would narrate and make a cameo appearance at the climax. The film was never completed in his lifetime.      Stage: ""All Shook Up"", a show based on his work, debuted on Broadway in 2004.      During the days following Elvis\' death, Philadelphia Phillies\' pitcher Tug McGraw (father of Tim McGraw), with guitar in hand, played a medley of Elvis\' songs on the team bus.      In the 1981 documentary This Is Elvis (1981), in previously unseen footage, Elvis sang ""Always On My Mind"", a #16 hit from 1972 written for him by Mark James. Just months later, in 1981, Willie Nelson covered the song and it became a Grammy winner and one of Nelson\'s all-time signature hits. As the song was not written specifically for the film, it could not qualify for an Academy Award nomination. The Academy Award-winning song for 1981 was ""The Theme from ""Arthur"".      Reportedly, in 1969 he received a death threat, just prior to his opening in Las Vegas. Though he had FBI agents providing security for him, for added protection he carried a Derringer pistol on stage, in his shoe.      During rehearsal for his June 5, 1956, appearance on Texaco Star Theatre Starring Milton Berle (1948), Berle reportedly said to Elvis. ""Let\'s see what you can do without the guitar"". What resulted was a captivating extended televised performance by Elvis of the not yet recorded ""Hound Dog""; enjoyable to his fans, though shocking to others including the news media, it was a song that he had been performing, up to that point, with guitar in hand. By the time of his second appearance on Toast of the Town (1948), later in 1956, Elvis sang without his guitar, with The Jordanaires as his back-up vocal group and his back-up combo. For the most part this format would be followed for all of Elvis\' stage performances for the remainder of his career. In 1969, when he returned to Las Vegas, a full orchestra was added.      It was after his appearance on Texaco Star Theatre Starring Milton Berle: Episode #8.13 (1956) that Presley inadvertently earned the nickname ""Elvis the Pelvis"". While performing his classic ""Hound Dog"", Presley switched tempo in the middle of the song and began gyrating his hips suggestively. The performance caused such a furor that Berle received a reported 30,000 letters decrying his decision to allow such ""lewd behavior"" on national television. During the show Presley was backed by Scotty Moore (guitar), Bill Black (bass) and D.J. Fontana (drums).      Prior to marrying Priscilla Presley, Elvis proposed marriage to legendary cult actress Tura Satana, who turned him down. It is believed that Priscilla copied her hairstyle after that.      One set of genealogical research states that Elvis\' surname leads back to Irish ancestors, who hailed from the village of Hacketstown in County Carlow. William Presley was forced to leave Ireland for America after a local dispute over land. He later moved to Carolina, where he had a son called Dunnan, and then moved on to Tennessee. Dunnan\'s granddaughter Rosella was born in 1863 and, though she never married, she had several children including one called Jessie. He named his son Vernon Elvis, and Vernon Presley later named his son Elvis Aaron Presley, the man who went on to become The King.      Curiously, cut from the 2009 issue of his critically acclaimed film King Creole (1958) was his performance of ""Hard Headed Woman"" a #1 hit for Elvis at the time of the film\'s release. A rare occurrence, possibly, the only time in film history that an essential musical number has been cut from a film, over a half-century after the film\'s release. Added in its place in 2009 is the then previously unseen stripper\'s sequence with the song ""Banana"". In 1958 the ""Banana"" scene, complete with female stripper, with its obvious phallic reference, would have been ""too much"" for the censors and mainstream America.      Of Terry Stafford\'s 1964 cover of Elvis\' recording of ""Suspicion"", a back-up group was added to sing the word ""suspicion"". This addition proved successful for Stafford, though many listeners still think they are listening to Elvis. Stafford\'s version of the song received considerable airplay and rose to #3 on the US pop charts.      Many rock singers mimicked Elvis\' singing style, early in their careers, before adopting their own style for which they are most remembered. The most successful, in that area, was Conway Twitty with his (1958-61) hit recordings of ""It\'s Only Make Believe"", ""The Story Of My Love"" and ""Lonely Blue Boy"", originally recorded by Elvis as ""Danny"" for King Creole (1958) but later cut from the film. Twitty later crossed over to the country field. Charlie Rich\'s initial hit, ""Lonely Weekend"" (1960), followed the same pattern, long before he was known as country music\'s ""Silver Fox"". One of Johnny Rivers\' first recordings, ""You\'re The One"" (1958), and a 1956 recording of ""That\'ll Be The Day"" by Buddy Holly--not the 1957 million selling version that is most played--sounded like Elvis behind the mike. There were also ""one-hit wonders"" like Ral Donner, the narrative voice of Elvis in This Is Elvis (1981), who had a million seller with ""You Don\'t Know What You Got Until You Lose It"" (1961). Of course, there\'s Terry Stafford\'s successful 1964 cover of Elvis\' recording of ""Suspicion"".      During the rehearsal for his 1968 TV Special Elvis (1968), he reportedly gave an impromptu performance of ""MacArthur Park,, a big hit of the day for Richard Harris. Unfortunately, that performance was not recorded.      ""I\'ll Be Home For Christmas"", was the original closing number for Elvis\' special, Elvis (1968). On previous occasions he headlined Christmas specials that were aired on radio stations throughout the Southern US. Producer Steve Binder and Elvis decided that a song that reflected the turbulence of the 1960s, and at the same time gave a plea for hope and understanding, would be more appropriate than a Christmas ballad to end the show. Earl Brown, the show\'s Musical Director, was asked by Binder to go home and write such a song. He did just that and composed, on short notice, ""If I Can Dream"", with its reference to Martin Luther King\'s 1963 ""I Have A Dream"" speech, given in Washington, DC. Brown\'s newly composed song contained the lyrics, ""If I can dream of a better land, where all my brothers walk hand in hand"". With minimal rehearsing and no demo to work with, Elvis\' spontaneous live performance of the new closing song was released as his next million-selling single, peaking at #13 on the US pop charts. The success of ""If I Can Dream"" led the way for Elvis to record other songs with social issues, such as ""In the Ghetto"", ""Clean Up Your Own Backyard"" and ""Don\'t Cry Daddy"".      His 1st big performance was at the Oventon Park Shell in Memphis in 1954.      He was discharged from the army on March 24, 1960. Eight days later, on April 1, he began filming G.I. Blues (1960).      His 1972 live album recorded at Madison Square Garden featured many celebrities in the audience, including George Harrison, Art Garfunkel, David Bowie, all the members of Ten Years After and Led Zeppelin, Paul Simon and Bob Dylan. It was reported that John Lennon was secretly in the audience, but Lennon insisted in a 1975 interview that he had never seen Elvis live. Bruce Springsteen was in the audience, having signed with Columbia Records about a month prior. The album was also the inspiration for a young Eddie Murphy, who would play it loud and lip-sync to it in front of the mirror. Murphy has gone on to say that it was Elvis who inspired him to become an entertainer.      Although Bob Dylan enormously admired him, Elvis was disparaging of Dylan, especially in terms of his singing voice. Once he was said to privately quip, ""My mouth\'s so dry, feels like Bob Dylan slept in it"". Later, however, he recorded a cover of Dylan\'s song, ""Tomorrow is a Long Time"". Elvis reportedly disliked much of the 1960s popular music, including The Beatles, because he associated it with the ""drug culture"", although he did freely cover songs by many such bands.      In early March of 1960, Elvis was on his way back to America from military duty in Germany. The plane Elvis was boarding on made a brief stop in the town of Prestwick, Scotland, where he was greeted and embraced by hundreds of British fans. This would be his first and only visit in the United Kingdom.      Was one of the many dozen of celebrities like John Agar, John Russell and Sabu who visited renowned animal trainer and Hollywood animal behaviorist Ralph Helfer\'s Africa U.S.A. Exotic Animal Ranch in Soledad Canyon, California on weekends to play with the animals and pitch in with the chores. Elvis\' favorite animal was a chimp named Coffee, who once belonged to Mae West.      Pictured on a USA \'forever\' commemorative postage stamp in the Music Icons series, issued 12 August 2015. Price on day of issue was 49Â¢.      Childhood friend of Wink Martindale.      Had a twin brother, Jesse Caron, who died in infancy.      His all-time favorite horror movie was Black Christmas (1974). He made it a tradition to watch the film every Christmas and to this day his family honors his memory by watching the film every Christmas.      Received his first ever screen kiss from co-star Jana Lund in Loving You (1957).      Former son-in-law of Ann Beaulieu and stepson-in-law of Paul Beaulieu.      Former brother-in-law of Michelle Beaulieu Hovey.      He was widely known to be a very private man.      ""The All American Boy"" is a 1958 \'talking blues\' song written by Bobby Bare, but credited by Fraternity Records to Bill Parsons, with songwriting credit to Bill Parsons and Orville Lunsford. The song reached #2 on the Billboard charts and was inspired by the success and then conscription of Elvis Presley.      Double first cousin of Patsy Presley Geranen.      Though Elvis is famed for the ""I don\'t sound like nobody"". He did have idols, and one of these, was dubbed \'the greatest entertainer of them all\' it seems a fitting tribute to think that the King was in awe of Al Jolson.      When he wanted to emulate Ricky Nelson\'s hairstyle, his hairdresser Carrie White talked him out of it: ""Elvis please, let\'s don\'t mess with success."" He gifted her with a derringer.Personal Quotes (36)      [asked who he sounded like] I don\'t sound like nobody.      [asked what kind of music he sings] I sing all kinds.      I don\'t like being called Elvis The Pelvis. That\'s gotta be one of the most childish expressions I\'ve ever heard coming from an adult.      Some people tap their feet, some people snap their fingers, and some people sway back and forth. I just sorta do \'em all together, I guess.      [his acceptance speech from the 1970 Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Nation Awards] When I was a child, ladies and gentlemen, I was a dreamer. I read comic books, and I was the hero of the comic book. I saw movies, and I was the hero in the movie. So every dream I ever dreamed has come true a hundred times . . . I learned very early in life that ""Without a song, the day would never end; without a song, a man ain\'t got a friend; without a song, the road would never bend - without a song"". So I keep singing a song. Goodnight. Thank you.      There\'s been a big change in the music field in the last 10 or 12 years. I think everything has improved--the sounds have improved, the musicians have improved, the engineers have definitely improved. I like a lot of the new groups, y\'know, The Beatles and The Byrds and the . . . whoever, but I really like a lot of the new music, but a lot of it is basically, our music is basically, rock \'n roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues. People have been adding to it, adding instruments to it, experimenting with it.      I just fell into it, really. My daddy and I were laughing about it the other day. He looked at me and said, ""What happened, El? The last thing I remember is I was working in a can factory and you were driving a truck"". We all feel the same way about it. Still, it just caught us up.      [on performing] It\'s like a surge of electricity going through you. It\'s almost like making love, but it\'s even stronger than that . . . sometimes I think my heart is going to explode.      My daddy had seen a lot of people who played guitars and stuff and didn\'t work, so he said, ""You should make up your mind either about being an electrician or playing a guitar, and I never saw a guitar player that was worth a damn"".      The image is one thing and the human being is another, it\'s very hard to live up to an image.      A live concert to me is exciting because of all the electricity that is generated in the crowd and on stage. It\'s my favorite part of the business - live concerts.      I\'ve never gotten over what they call stage fright. I go through it every show. I\'m pretty concerned, I\'m pretty much thinking about the show. I never get completely comfortable with it, and I don\'t let the people around me get comfortable with it, in that I remind them that it\'s a new crowd out there, it\'s a new audience, and they haven\'t seen us before. So it\'s got to be like the first time we go on.      [at a 1972 press conference in Madison Square Garden] Man, I was tame compared to what they do now, are you kidding? All that I ever did was just jiggle.      I want to entertain people. That\'s my whole life. To my last breath.      The police filmed a show one time in Florida because of the PGA, YMCA, or somebody. They thought that I was . . . something. They said, ""Man, he\'s got to be crazy"". So they, the police, came out and filmed the show. I couldn\'t move. I had to stand still. The only thing I could move was my little finger like that. ""You ain\'t nothing but a hound dog crying all the time"", y\'know, for the whole show.      Take care of the fans and they will sure as hell take care of you.      I don\'t know anything about music. In my line you don\'t have to.      I wiggle my shoulders, I shake my legs, I walk up and down the stage, I hop around on one foot. But I never bump and grind. Why, that\'s vulgar. I\'d never do anything vulgar before an audience. My mother would never allow it.Roy Orbison is the greatest singer in the world.      [in 1956] The colored folks been singing it and playing it just like I\'m doin\' now, man, for more years than I know. They played it like that in their shanties and in their juke joints and nobody paid it no mind \'til I goosed it up. I got it from them. Down in Tupelo, Mississippi, I used to hear old Arthur Crudup bang his box the way I do now and I said if I ever got to a place I could feel all old Arthur felt, I\'d be a music man like nobody ever saw.      I get tired of playing a guy who gets into a fight, then starts singing to the guy he\'s just beat up.      I am not the King. Jesus Christ is the King. I\'m just an entertainer.      Since I was two years old, all I knew was gospel music. That music became such a part of my life it was as natural as dancing. A way to escape from my problems, an my way of release.      [on Blue Hawaii (1961)] In the movie we did a song called the ""Hawaiian Wedding Song"". And it was so real that it took me ten years before I realized I wasn\'t married to the chick.      Truth is like the sun. You can shut it out for a time, but it ain\'t goin\' away.      I sure lost my musical direction in Hollywood. My songs were the same conveyor belt mass production, just like most of my movies were.      Just because you look good, don\'t mean you feel good.      I knew by heart all the dialogue of James Dean\'s films; I could watch Rebel Without a Cause (1955) a hundred times over.      Only thing worse than watching a bad movie is being in one.      Rhythm is something you either have or don\'t have, but when you have it, you have it all over.      Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine.      I can never forget the longing to be someone. I guess if you are poor you always think bigger and want more than those who have everything.      [asked by a reporter in 1972 about his opinion of war protesters] Honey, I\'d just as soon keep my own personal views about that to myself. I\'m just an entertainer, and I\'d rather not say.      The image is one thing and the human being is another. I try very hard to live up to an image, I\'ll put it that way.      It\'s your baby, you rock it.      [from a letter delivered to President Nixon\'s office on December 21, 1970] Sir, I can and will be of any I service that I can to help the country out. I have no concern or motive other than helping the country out, so I wish not to be given a title or an appointed position. I can and will do more good if I were made a Federal Agent at Large, and I will help best by doing it my way through my communications with people of all ages.

Messer) was known for most of his career as a mop-faced villain capable of the most vicious and contemptible of crimes, the man himself was quite a happy and hearty gent who loved to play practical jokes, particularly on his family. Robert was educated at the University of Cincinnati and the Carnegie Institute of Technology, where he studied music. His deep, mellifluous voice earned him steady work as a radio announcer which, in turn, sparked his interest in acting.In the early 1950s Middleton made it to Broadway, appearing in ""Ondine."" This in turn led to films and TV, where he solidified his evil image in such strong fare as The Desperate Hours (1955) as a sadistic killer, The Court Jester (1955) as a grim and determined knight who jousts with Danny Kaye in the famous ""pellet with the poison"" sequence, and as a sinister politician in The Lincoln Conspiracy (1977). Betwixt and between were an array of brutish mountain daddies, corrupt, cigar-chomping town bosses and lynch mob leaders. Occasionally he showed a bit of levity, as in his recurring role as Jackie Gleason\'s boss on The Honeymooners (1955) sketches. Middleton died of congestive heart failure in Hollywood at the age of 66.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net                    Robert Middleton was also in 2 episodes of The Big Valley.

The fanfare of a young Elvis Presley and his first movie certainly was
blinding when it came to 
this movie. It was hard for people to see past it, however, upon viewing the
picture, Presley's 
star dims as he takes his seat at the table among some of the acting greats
of cinema. The 
viewer relinquishes the idea that it's Elvis and accepts him as the doting
youngest son of the 
Reno family.<br><br>Dramatic without being maudlin, the picture chronicles the lives of one
family post-Civil War, 
and how each member dealt with the harsh realities of war. Hearing that the
eldest son Vance 
(Egan) has died, Clint (Presley) and Vance's former love (Paget) marry in
the aftermath of the 
murder of her parents and the Reno boys father. As is in wartime, things
become increasingly 
more difficult when he and his two other brothers Brett (Campbell) and Ray

My guess would be that the story for Love Me Tender was probably laying
around the offices at 20th Century Fox and would have been a B western
starring Richard Egan. In fact the original title was in fact The
Brothers Reno. <br><br>But along came Elvis Presley and when Darryl F. Zanuck signed him for
his feature film debut the story had to be reworked to accommodate his
presence. Of course four songs had to be added, including the title
tune, which was a rewording of the famous Civil War era ballad Aura
Lee.<br><br>The Reno brothers, Richard Egan, James Drury, and William Campbell go
to war, enlisting in the Confederate Army. The youngest brother Elvis
Presley stays home to take care of Mother Reno, played by Mildred
Dunnock and the family farm. When it's reported that Egan was killed,
fiancÃ© Debra Paget marries Elvis.<br><br>Of course all three Reno brothers return, sound of wind and limb. The

by Robert Middleton is willing to forgive and forget if he gets the
money back. That and the return of Egan lead to the ensuing conflicts
in Love Me Tender.<br><br>I have no doubt that Colonel Tom Parker chose this particular screen
property for his star and as usual Colonel Tom chose well. The southern
civil war background of the story made perfect casting for Elvis. Of
course his hip wiggling gyrations in the post bellum South seem out of
place, but that's what the ticket buyers to an Elvis film wanted.<br><br>And he certainly sang Love Me Tender real good.

Finally got around to seeing Elvis Presley's debut film in its entirety
and in widescreen, and I think it's a good deal better than it's
usually given credit for. Richard Egan plays Vance Reno, who is serving
in the Civil War and returns home after the war ends to join his family
and reunite with his lover (Debra Paget). But a tragedy ensues when
it's learned that while he was away, his young brother Clint (Elvis)
fell in love with and married his girl, after hearing that Vance had
died. Also factoring into the trouble is that Vance has kept some Union
cash which he never delivered to its destination when he found out the
war had ended in the interim.<br><br>This turned out to be a good, solid story with fine performances,
especially by Richard Egan. But again, Elvis is amazing as a completely
first-time novice actor. He always wanted to be on the big screen from
youth, after admiring James Dean, Marlon Brando and Tony Curtis. For a
film fan who never had any professional acting training or experience,
he's really quite good as Clint Reno. Though he didn't want to sing in
this film, Presley was already a big recording star so of course there
had to be songs in the movie. The title tune is a classic and it's very
emotional as perfromed within the context of the film. I also like the
singalong ditty ""We're Gonna Move"", which is performed by Elvis on the
front porch ""1950s-style"" with his family, even though it's 1865. Other
songs include the unremarkable ""Let Me"" and ""Poor Boy"". *** out of ****

If you want to avoid the low-quality movies that Elvis unfortunately
made during the 1960's you can still watch this piece. That the ""King""
is not in the main role gives the film more credibility and you can
really say that Love Me Tender is a good movie. With Elvis only as a
troubadour works fine and the film remains a proper western too.<br><br>Perhaps there has been better westerns too but the storyline in this
one is enough interesting: a man returns from the American Civil War
and finds his wife at home married to another man. With this marital
mess and some other problems being solved Elvis drops in and offers
some fresh music, or the music that was still fresh when the movie was
being made. It is anyway relaxing to see the ""King"" in a most unspoiled
context.

I didn't expect this movie to rise above a campy Western with lots of
Elvis thrown in, but I was WRONG! The story is SOLID: Confederate
raiders rob Union payroll by overpowering and posing as the Yankee
guard. Unbeknownst to them, the Civil War ended the day before and when
they come to deliver the cash to a beleaguered Reb HQ, they find out
the truth. They keep the cash (natch!), divided squarely, and head for
their homes. What follows is alternately surprising, rousing, touching,
and even heroic. The love angles and heartbreaks are true without being
either overbearing or oversentimental; the chase scenes are
mercifully-short; sub-text characters are given enough delineation to
evoke interest and sympathy without burdening the main plot. No threads
are left dangling, and suspension of disbelief is at a minimum, except
(of course) Elvis' swaying hips in 1865 Dixie! The ending was
purposedly refinish to accommodating insulted Elvis fans, but it
doesn't matter, even if Elvis' hair is a different color than in the
film.<br><br>Perhaps the least interesting part of the film (for me) was Elvis'
singing, although his swiveling never fails to amaze.

When it was announced that 21-one year old Elvis Presley would make his
debut as a film actor, the publicity was huge. Some predicted that he
would become a new James Dean; Dean had tragically died in a car
accident the year before. Montgomery Clift had not made a new film in
the last few years. Paul Newman was still struggling to find his style.
Marlon Brando was still very much around, of course, but there was
definitely room for another ""sensitive young male rebel"" in 1950's
Hollywood. In at least one interview, however, Elvis appeared somewhat
uncomfortable with the James Dean-comparison; ""James Dean was a genius
at acting,"" he declared. Dean was also a trained actor by the time he
became a star, whereas the thought of making Elvis Presley into an
actor was clearly based on a wish to capitalize on his popularity as a
singer.<br><br>The result, LOVE ME TENDER, was a decent enough start. It's a
straight-forward western, covering the lives of four brothers, three of
whom have just returned home from service during the Civil War in 1865.
Both their mother and fourth and youngest brother Clint (Elvis
Presley...) are extremely happy to see them back. However, one of the
brothers, Vance, is hurt when he discovers that Clint has married his
former sweetheart Cathy, though he insists it doesn't matter to him, in
order to make his younger brother happy. Many more problems soon
arrive, however, leading to a dramatic climax with murder being the
eventual outcome. In the very last scene, we witness Clint (or really,
Elvis) singing ""Love Me Tender"" to us through a ghost-like image.
Elvis's real-life mother reportedly cried at the end; and I'll admit
that a few tears did come down my cheeks as well.<br><br>However, the main reason why the ending works so well with Elvis
singing, is probably due to his charisma as a singer. Even later on,
when he appeared in far more indifferent films than this one, one could
not argue against his skills with voice and rhythm. This is confirmed
also in other places in LOVE ME TENDER, when he performs ""We're Gonna
Move,"" ""Let Me"" and ""Poor Boy"" (none of them classics on par with the
title song, perhaps -- but still very enjoyable). As an actor, however,
Presley is somewhat less extraordinary. Please do not interpret this as
too harsh criticism, because it is not meant to be; his performance is
by all means good enough to work for a straight-forward western of this
kind. But he does not quite prove himself to be a new James Dean (or
Clift or Brando). In his next three films, LOVING YOU, JAILHOUSE ROCK
and KING CREOLE, it works better, I guess partly because he in these
films played a role that he could more easily identify with (a
contemporary rock'n'roll-talent, just as in real life). However, LOVE
ME TENDER is quite enjoyable, with the ending being rather moving.

This film is a solid Civil war drama w/ a strong cast and a realistic
and believable main story and supporting subplots. In my opinion, the
major drama unfolds from the train robbery early on in the film.
Subsequent to that there's the subplot of shifting alliances among the
ex-Rebel soldiers and the Union effort to recover the stolen $12,250
followed by the three angle romantic drama involving the Presley, Egan,
and Paget characters. I think at first this subplot appears to be the
main drama, but I watched the film twice and argue that it is a subplot
(although the film title &amp; title tune suggest differently). Neville
Brand gives strong support as his greedy character is pivotal to the
Presley's character arc. I wonder why Presley didn't have a flashback
scene (to when the Egan character assures him ""Deep from my heart"" that
he would never lie to the Presley character) after he's been convinced
by the Brand character that the Egan character betrayed him.<br><br>The movie has a nice quick pace. In the picnic scene when Presley
learns Egan is leaving for California I like how in the background the
Union soldiers subtly appear and the main story resumes. However, it's
here in the picnic sequence that an earlier scene produces UNINTENDED
LAUGHS when Presley is up on stage swinging his pelvis and singing 50's
music to a clearly 50's female teen crowd AND it is is supposed to be
1865! It gets even funnier when there's a reaction shot of his ""Ma""
(who based on her Southern puritan values should be horrified at the
sight) smiling happy as a clam. TOTALLY LAUGH OUT LOUD!

Though this is the one film that Elvis didn't receive top billing for, his
tremendous singing and acting ability go a long way toward making it a lot
of fun to watch.  He shows us here that he was a terrific actor as well as
a
gifted singer.  The story starts off a little slow but hits the mark after
the first ten to fifteen minutes and leads to a well crafted climax.

The fanfare of a young Elvis Presley and his first movie certainly was
blinding when it came to 
this movie. It was hard for people to see past it, however, upon viewing the
picture, Presley's 
star dims as he takes his seat at the table among some of the acting greats
of cinema. The 
viewer relinquishes the idea that it's Elvis and accepts him as the doting
youngest son of the 
Reno family.<br><br>Dramatic without being maudlin, the picture chronicles the lives of one
family post-Civil War, 
and how each member dealt with the harsh realities of war. Hearing that the
eldest son Vance 
(Egan) has died, Clint (Presley) and Vance's former love (Paget) marry in
the aftermath of the 
murder of her parents and the Reno boys father. As is in wartime, things
become increasingly 
more difficult when he and his two other brothers Brett (Campbell) and Ray
(Drury) to find 
this, as well the spoils of war haunting them shortly upon their
return.<br><br>It's an honest look at a difficult time in this country, with great

He was the youngest of four children. During WWI, he volunteered and was commissioned as an infantry lieutenant, and was wounded three times.A distinguished stage actor in his native Hungary, Austria-Hungary, he ended up a drug-addicted pauper in Hollywood, thanks largely to typecasting brought about by his most famous role. He began his stage career in 1901 and started appearing in films during World War I, fleeing to Germany in 1919 as a result of his left-wing political activity (he organized an actors\' union). In 1920 he emigrated to the US and made a living as a character actor, shooting to fame when he played Count Dracula in the legendary 1927 Broadway stage adaptation of Bram Stoker\'s novel. It ran for three years, and was subsequently, and memorably, filmed by Tod Browning in 1931, establishing Lugosi as one of the screen\'s greatest personifications of pure evil. Also in 1931, he became a U.S. citizen. Sadly, his reputation rapidly declined, mainly because he was only too happy to accept any part (and script) handed to him, and ended up playing pathetic parodies of his greatest role, in low-grade poverty row shockers. He ended his career working for the legendary Worst Director of All Time, Edward D. Wood Jr..Lugosi was married Ilona Szmik (1917 - 1920), Ilona von Montagh (? - ?), and Lillian Arch (1933 - 1951). He is the father of Bela Lugosi Jr. (1938). Lugosi helped organize the Screen Actors Guild in the mid-\'30s, joining as member number 28.Bela Lugosi died of a heart attack August 16, 1956. He was buried in his full Dracula costume, including a cape.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       ReelDeal-2 and Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk>          Spouse (5)               Hope Lininger          (25 August\xa01955            - 16 August\xa01956)\xa0(his death)                         Lillian Arch          (31 January\xa01933            - 17 July\xa01953)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)                         Beatrice Weeks          (29 September\xa01929            - 2 October\xa01929)\xa0(divorced)                         Ilona von Montagh          (7 September\xa01921            - 1924)\xa0(divorced)                         Ilona Szmik          (25 June\xa01917            - 1920)\xa0(divorced)          Trade Mark (6)        Slicked back hair and prominent widow\'s peak        Thick Hungarian accent        His pale complexion        The role of Count Dracula        Best known for his roles in horror films and particularly in films produced by Universal Studios        Renowned for treating even the most ridiculous of material with immense respect and his aggressive work ethicTrivia (42)      Born in Lugos, Hungary (now Lugoj, Romania), from which he derived his eventual professional surname.      His son, Bela Lugosi Jr., practices law in Los Angeles, California (1995).      Following his death, he was interred at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.      Were it not for his death, Lon Chaney, rather than Lugosi, would have been the director Tod Browning\'s choice for the starring role in Dracula (1931).      On the set, he camouflaged his drug addiction by sipping burgundy.      Contrary to popular belief, he and Boris Karloff did not hate each other, as the famous scene from Ed Wood (1994) would lead one to believe. Both men\'s children have said that the only rivalry that existed between them is when they were both up for the same roles, and in reality, Lugosi and Karloff had almost no relationship off-set. However, near the sad end of his life, Lugosi allegedly had at least one methadone-addled fantasy that Karloff was a bogeyman out to get him.      He was one of the charter members of the Screen Actors Guild.      In 1929 he married a wealthy San Francisco widow named Beatrice Weeks, a union which lasted all of three days; their divorce named Clara Bow as the ""other woman""--it was a media sensation and launched him into national notoriety.      Pictured on one of a set of five 32Â¢ US commemorative postage stamps, issued 30 September 1997, celebrating ""Famous Movie Monsters"". He is shown as the title character in Dracula (1931). Other actors honored in this set of stamps, and the classic monsters they portray, are Lon Chaney as The Phantom of the Opera (1925); Lon Chaney Jr. as The Wolf Man (1941); and Boris Karloff on two stamps as The Mummy (1932) and the monster in Frankenstein (1931).      Had a long extensive classical career in Hungary including roles in ""Hamlet"", ""Macbeth"", ""King Lear"", ""Taming of the Shrew"" and ""Richard III"".      His first stage role in the United States was ""The Red Poppy"". Unable to speak English, he was forced to learn the role by rote. He was rewarded with excellent reviews and earned his first American film role, a villainous role in The Silent Command (1923) as a result.      At the time of his death, Lugosi was in such poor financial straits that Frank Sinatra was rumored to have paid for his funeral. Actually, Bela\'s widow Hope and ex-wife Lillian paid it; Sinatra\'s only connection to the aging actor was sending him a $1000 check during his drug rehabilitation. The rumor that Boris Karloff attended the funeral was also an urban myth, as he wasn\'t in California at the time.      He performed in live-action reference footage for the ""Night on Bald Mountain"" sequence of Walt Disney\'s Fantasia (1940). He was, of course, the terrifying demon Chernabog.      His Los Angeles home was purchased by Johnny Depp, the actor who portrayed his friend Edward D. Wood Jr. in the film Ed Wood (1994).      Further immortalized in the song ""Bela Lugosi\'s Dead"" by Bauhaus, which was featured in The Hunger (1983) and went on to become a dance mainstay at goth dance clubs in the 1980s. The lyrics of the song described him in his Dracula costume, along with ""Undead! Undead! Undead!"" being chanted during the song\'s chorus.      His performance in Tod Browning\'s Dracula (1931) created such a sensation that he reportedly received more fan mail from females than even Clark Gable.      His name had become such as asset that studios would give him prominent billing even when he was playing such supporting roles as butlers, as he did in Columbia\'s Night of Terror (1933), Fox\'s The Gorilla (1939), Universal\'s Night Monster (1942) and Paramount\'s One Body Too Many (1944).      In his collaborations with Boris Karloff at Universal, it was Karloff who always got top billing. When these same films were released as part of a DVD box set in 2005, Universal chose to market them as ""The Bela Lugosi Collection"".      He still spoke very little English by the time he shot Dracula (1931), He had made the role famous on Broadway, but most of his lines he had learned phonetically (which gave his readings an oily, seductive quality), and used the same technique for the film version. It was another two years after he shot Dracula (1931) before he became fluent in English, although he had made several films after that one.      He received only $500 per week for the seven-week engagement on Dracula (1931) a total of $3500. However, in 2007 purchasing power, that would be equal to $47,319. In comparison, Universal paid $2000 per week for the use of leading man David Manners, but Manners was a contract player at First National Pictures. The payment went to that studio, not to Manners, who was paid only his usual weekly rate from First National.      Served in the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I as an infantry captain. He later recounted in stories on film sets about his experiences, which included acting as a hangman. He also said that at one point he hid in a mass grave of corpses to escape death. After being wounded three times, he was discharged while apparently feigning concussion-caused insanity.      Lugosi himself perpetrated the myth that he had quit the role of the monster in Frankenstein (1931), which is untrue. Originally, director Robert Florey wanted him to play Dr. Frankenstein, but producer Carl Laemmle Jr. did not want Lugosi in that role and relegated him to the monster role. Lugosi was unhappy with playing the plodding, mute monster under heavy make-up and complained. He had filmed some screen tests with Florey, but Laemmle did not like what he saw and fired both Florey and Lugosi.      Lugosi was contracted to appear in Dracula\'s Daughter (1936) at a salary of $4,000, but the original script in which the character appeared was rejected by Universal. The final script did not involve Dracula, except for an insert shot of him in his coffin, but Lugosi was paid off, earning $500 more for not appearing in Dracula\'s Daughter (1936) than he earned for starring in Dracula (1931).      According to biographer Robert Cremer, Lugosi was not only the finest party host among Hungarian members of the Hollywood community but also an inveterate practical joker. When other expatriates such as Joe Pasternak, Ilona Massey, Michael Curtiz and Willy Pogany were guests, he would hire comic actor Vince Barnett to play the role of a clumsy waiter spilling drinks and dropping plates of hors d\'oeuvres, resulting in near misses for the guests to Lugosi\'s delight.      His wife and son had him buried in his cape from his role as the title character of Dracula (1931).      He did not wear fangs when playing the title character in Dracula (1931). The same was true of Frank Langella in Dracula (1979).      He has two roles in common with Christopher Lee: (1) Lugosi played Count Dracula in Dracula (1931) and Bud Abbott Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) while Lee played him in ten films from Dracula (1958) to Dracula pÃ¨re et fils (1976) and (2) Lugosi played Frankenstein\'s Monster in Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943) while Lee played him in The Curse of Frankenstein (1957).      He has two roles in common with Lon Chaney Jr.: (1) Lugosi played Count Dracula in Dracula (1931) and Bud Abbott Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) while Chaney played him in Son of Dracula (1943) and (2) Chaney played Frankenstein\'s Monster in The Ghost of Frankenstein (1942), in which Lugosi also appeared, while Lugosi played him in Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943), in which Chaney also appeared.      He appeared with Boris Karloff in seven films: The Black Cat (1934), The Raven (1935), The Invisible Ray (1936), Son of Frankenstein (1939), You\'ll Find Out (1940), Black Friday (1940) and The Body Snatcher (1945).      He appeared with Lon Chaney Jr. in five films: The Wolf Man (1941), The Ghost of Frankenstein (1942), Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943), Bud Abbott Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) and The Black Sleep (1956).      He was posthumously awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6430 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on February 8, 1960.      Bela Lugosi passed away on August 16, 1956, two months away from what would have been his 74th birthday on October 20.      Is referenced in The Kinks 1972 song ""Celluloid Heroes"", with the lines ""Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi, because he\'s liable to turn and bite."".      Contrary to popular belief, Lugosi only played Count Dracula in two films: Dracula (1931) and Bud Abbott Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). He played vampires in many other films, but none of them--besides the aforementioned two--were Count Dracula.      Bela\'s personal cane featured in his infamous scene in ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" sold at Bonhams and Butterfields for $10,000. This cane is considered one of the only remaining props from the film. [November 2015].      Bela Lugosi ventured the jump across the pond to the USA. There he first had to content himself with smaller roles, first at the theater and from 1923 in movies too.      Privately Bela Lugosi had to struggle with his alcohol and drug addiction.      Because Bela Lugosi was also active political the situation in Hungary became precarious and finally he and his wife decided to leave Hungary. They came via Vienna to Berlin where he was able to continue his film career.      With ""Glen or Glenda"" (1953) he also appeared in a movie directed by Ed Wood jr. who sometimes is referred as the worst director ever. But because of this fact those movies became a kind of cult and Bela Lugosi became an icon for enthusiasts of such trash movies.      He already impersonated the figure of ""Dracula"" on Broadway from 1927 and when the director Tod Browning planned to make a movie of it the chance of Lugosi\'s life came - also because of the unexpected death of the actor Lon Chaney who was originally planned for the title role.      Because his parents were against his plans to become an actor he left the family and went to the theater where he made his first experiences as an actor. Finally he joined the film business in 1917 where he first used the pseudonym Arisztid Olt.      At the end of the Sledge Hammer episode _""Sledge Hammer"" (1986) Last of the Red Hot Vampires (#2.9)_ there is a dedication ""In Memory of Mr. Blasko,"" Lugosi\'s birth name.Personal Quotes (13)      I guess I\'m pretty much of a lone wolf. I don\'t say I don\'t like people at all but, to tell you the truth, I only like it then if I have a chance to look deep into their hearts and their minds.      [to director Edward D. Wood Jr., on the set of one of his legendary turkeys] This is the most uncomfortable coffin I\'ve ever been in.      Circumstances made me the theatrical personality I am, which many people believe is also a part of my personal life.      Every producer in Hollywood had set me down as a type. I was both amused and disappointed.      I\'d like to quit the supernatural roles and play just an interesting, down-to-earth person.      I\'ll be truthful. The weekly paycheck is the most important thing to me.      [on being typecast in villain roles] I find that, because of my language and gestures, that I am cataloged as what you call a heavy. My accent stamped me, in the imagination of the producers, as an enemy. Therefore, I must be a heavy.      In Hungary, acting is a career for which one fits himself as earnestly and studiously as one studies for a degree in medicine, law or philosophy. In Hungary, acting is a profession.      Every actor\'s greatest ambition is to create his own, definite and original role, a character with which he will always be identified. In my case, that role was Dracula.      Never has a role so influenced and dominated an actor\'s role as has the role of Dracula. He [Dracula] has, at times, infused me with prosperity and, at other times, he has drained me of everything.      [on playing Dracula] It\'s a living, but it\'s also a curse. It\'s Dracula\'s curse.      If I had one per cent of the millions Dracula (1931) has made, I wouldn\'t be sitting here now.      [in response to an interviewer question ""Doesn\'t Dracula ever end for you?""] No. No. Dracula never ends. I don\'t know if I should call it a fortune or a curse, but Dracula ever ends.Salary (22)Dracula\xa0(1931)      $3,500       50 Million Frenchmen\xa0(1931)      $1,000       Chandu the Magician\xa0(1932)      $2,500       White Zombie\xa0(1932)      $800 /week      Island of Lost Souls\xa0(1932)      $875       The Black Cat\xa0(1934)      $3,000       Gift of Gab\xa0(1934)      $250 (1 day)      Mark of the Vampire\xa0(1935)      $3,000       The Raven\xa0(1935)      $5,000       The Mystery of the Mary Celeste\xa0(1935)      $10,000       The Invisible Ray\xa0(1936)      $4,000       Postal Inspector\xa0(1936)      $5,000 (flat rate)      SOS Coast Guard\xa0(1937)      $1,500       Son of Frankenstein\xa0(1939)      $500 /week, later raised to $3500/week      You\'ll Find Out\xa0(1940)      $3,750       The Return of the Vampire\xa0(1943)      $3,500       The Body Snatcher\xa0(1945)      $3,000       Genius at Work\xa0(1946)      $5,000       Bud Abbott Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein\xa0(1948)      $1,500 per week with ten week guarantee      Old Mother Riley Meets the Vampire\xa0(1952)      $5,000 (flat rate)      Glen or Glenda\xa0(1953)      $1,000 (flat rate, 1 day)      Bride of the Monster\xa0(1955)      $1,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nFrieda Inescort ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 12 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(6)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(1)  Overview (3)Date of Birth29\xa0June1901,\xa0Edinburgh, Scotland, UK Date of Death26\xa0February1976,\xa0Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, USA      \xa0(multiple sclerosis)    Birth NameFrieda WrightmanMini Bio (1)          Tall, dark and regal Frieda Inescort\'s placid loveliness and dignified patrician features bode her well in Hollywood during the late 30s and 40s. Born on June 29, 1901, in Edinburgh, Scotland, the stage-established actress didn\'t arrive in Hollywood until age 34 (then considered too late for leading lady roles!) but managed to settle fairly comfortably on the supporting sidelines in chic melodrama and tearjerkers.Her years growing up were unsettling. Born Frieda Wrightman, she was the daughter of Scots-born journalist John ""Jock"" Wrightman and actress Elaine Inescourt, who was of German and Polish descent. Her parents initially met when he came to review a play she was appearing in. They married in 1899 but eventually parted ways while Frieda was still young. Her impulsive mother, who had strong designs on a theater career and placed it high on her priority list, sent young Frieda off to live with other families and in boarding schools in England and Wales while she avidly pursued her dreams. Although her father divorced Elaine in 1911 charging his wife with abandonment and adultery, Frieda ended up moving to America with her mother. Again, when Elaine found occasional roles in touring shows, Frieda wound up being carted off to convents or boarding schools.Mother and daughter eventually returned to London following World War I and the young girl, now solely on her own, managed to find employment as a personal secretary to British Member of Parliament Waldorf Astor (2nd Viscount Astor), who was then Parliamentary Secretary to British Prime Minister David Lloyd-George. She also assisted the American-born Lady (Nancy) Astor. While accompanying Lady Astor on a trip to the United States in July 1919, Frieda decided to stay in the States and terminated her position with the Astors. In New York she continued finding secretarial work that supported both her and her unemployed actress-mother. She worked at one point with the British consulate in New York.Noticing a number of American actors cast in British parts on Broadway, Frieda was encouraged in the early 1920s to test the waters out as British actresses were in short supply. By chance, she was introduced to producer/director Winthrop Ames, who gave the unseasoned hopeful a small but showy role in his Broadway comedy ""The Truth About Blayds"" (1922). The play turned out to be a hit. Playwright Philip Barry caught her stage performance and offered her a starring role in his upcoming comedy production ""You and I"". The show proved to be another winner and Frieda, a star on the horizon, finally saw the end of her days as part of a secretarial pool.For the rest of the decade Frieda alternated between stage comedy and drama and became a vital force on Broadway with prominent roles in ""The Woman on the Jury"" (1923), ""The Fake"" (1924), ""Hay Fever"" (1925), ""Mozart"" (1926), ""Trelawney of the Wells"" (1926) and ""Escape"" (1927). Frieda\'s happenstance into acting and her sudden surge of success triggered deep envy and jealousy within her mother, who was unemployed. This led to a bitter and long-term estrangement between the two that never managed to heal itself. Elaine died in 1964.While working in the late 20s as an assistant for Putnam\'s Publishing Company in New York, Frieda met assistant editor Ben Ray Redman. They married in 1926 and Redman later became a literary critic for the New York Herald Tribune. Frieda, in the meantime, continued to resonate on the New York and touring stage with such plays as ""Springtime for Henry"" and ""When Ladies Meet"".For over a decade, Frieda had resisted the cinema, having turned down several offers in silent and early talking films. When her husband was offered a job with Universal Studios as a literary adviser and author, however, and the couple had to relocate to Hollywood, she decided to take a difference stance. Discovered by a talent scout while performing in a Los Angeles play, Frieda was signed by The Samuel Goldwyn Company and made her debut supporting \'Fredric March\' and Merle Oberon in the dewy-eyed drama The Dark Angel (1935) in which she received attractive notices and rare sympathy as blind author March\'s secretary.She did not stay long at Goldwyn, however, and went on to freelance for various other studios. During the course of her movie career, Frieda could be quite charming on the screen playing a wronged woman (as she did in Give Me Your Heart (1936)), but she specialized in haughtier hearts and played them older and colder than she really was off-camera. She soon gained a classy reputation for both her benign and haughty sophisticates. After Warner Bros. signed her up, she showed promise in Another Dawn (1937), Call It a Day (1937) and The Great O\'Malley (1937), all 1937 releases. After this, however, Warner Bros. lost interest in her career and loaned her out more and more to other studios. Some of these films were leads -- including the ""B""-level Woman Doctor (1939) opposite Henry Wilcoxon, A Woman Is the Judge (1939) with Otto Kruger, Shadows on the Stairs (1941) co-starring Paul Cavanagh, and, in particular, the title role in Portia on Trial (1937). For MGM she played the irrepressibly snobbish Caroline Bingley who sets her sights on Darcy (Laurence Olivier) in the classic Jane Austen film adaptation of Pride and Prejudice (1940). Besides competing with (and losing out) to Greer Garson in that film, she also played the ""other woman"" in Beauty for the Asking (1939) starring Lucille Ball.When her career starting to lose steam, Frieda returned to New York and the Broadway stage with matronly parts in Soldier\'s Wife"" (1944), ""The Mermaids Singing"" (1945) and George Bernard Shaw\'s successful revival of ""You Never Can Tell"" (1948). After the tour of the Shaw play folded, she returned to Hollywood. Finding it difficult to pick up where she left off in films, Frieda focused on the relatively new medium of TV in the early 1950s. She appeared as Mrs. Archer on the Meet Corliss Archer (1951) series (based on the popular bobbysoxer\'s radio program) but was replaced by Irene Tedrow in its second and final season. She also graced a number of dramatic TV showcases. The films she did do later that decade, including The She-Creature (1956), Senior Prom (1958), Juke Box Rhythm (1959), were generally dismissed by the critics.While filming her last picture, The Crowded Sky (1960), for Warner Bros., Frieda began experiencing health problems. She was quickly diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis. By the next year, she was forced to retire and had to walk with the aid of a cane. Things got worse that year when her husband, who had grown despondent over personal and financial issues, committed suicide with pills at their California home on August 2, 1961. By the mid-60s the former actress was virtually incapacitated and confined to a wheelchair but valiantly worked for the multiple sclerosis association when she could muster the strength. In 1973 Frieda finally had no choice but to move permanently into the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills, where she died at age 74 on February 21, 1976.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net          Spouse (1) Ben Ray Redman (3 February\xa01926            - 2 August\xa01961)\xa0(his death)          Trivia (6)      Daughter of actress Elaine Inescourt.

Acoording to a full-length article by Barrie Roberts for Classic Images, Frieda signed a contract with Warner Bros. only to discover she had been hired as a threat to keep temperamental star Kay Francis in line. Frieda went on to appear in support of Francis in two films.      An avid knitter, she often gave hand-knitted gifts for friends and co-workers.

Nina was born with the unusually multi-ethnic name of Nina Consuelo Maud Fock, her father being the renowned Dutch composer and conductor Dirk Fock, and her mother the stage and silent film actress Consuelo Flowerton, who once worked in a Valentino movie. Her parents divorced while she was a toddler and she and her mother moved to New York where Nina was encouraged to indulge in her creative and artistic leanings. A teen concert pianist, Nina also excelled at painting and sculpture, but it was acting that captured her heart. With that, she trained at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and became an enthusiastic exponent of the ""Method"" technique after studying with acting gurus Lee Strasberg and Stella Adler.Revising her last name to a classier sounding ""Foch"", Nina appeared briefly on the regional stage before earning a starlet contract with Columbia at age 19. Her debut in Bela Lugosi\'s The Return of the Vampire (1943) was followed by featured roles in other more or less modest efforts. She had her first standout role in the popular Chopin biopic A Song to Remember (1945) starring Cornel Wilde, which led to Nina\'s title role in one of her best films My Name Is Julia Ross (1945), earning major plaudits as a heroine on the brink of madness. Despite her obvious capabilities, she became inextricably entrenched in secondary movie fare, some of them nevertheless achieving near cult status such as I Love a Mystery (1945), The Guilt of Janet Ames (1947), The Dark Past (1948), and her last for Columbia, Johnny Allegro (1949) with George Raft.Nina relieved some of the disappointment of her film career by actively pursuing the stage, where she scored a Broadway hit with the classy comedy ""John Loves Mary"" in 1947, followed by productions of ""The Respectful Prostitute"" and ""Twelfth Night"". A one-time member of the American Shakespeare Festival at Stratford, she performed as Isabella in ""Measure for Measure"" and Katharine in ""The Taming of the Shrew"". She wasted no time securing early TV drama work and numerous summer stock roles also added to her enjoyment. MGM utilized her in a supporting capacity for some of their films, notably the ritzy patron and paramour-in-waiting of artist Gene Kelly whom she loses to Leslie Caron in An American in Paris (1951). The studio also handed her the Oscar-nominated role of the lonely but altruistic executive secretary in the all-star ensemble drama Executive Suite (1954). While Nina customarily lent poise and class to her on-camera roles in the late 50s and 60s, she seldom was given the chance to truly shine in the ensuing years. Nothing underscored this problem better than her standard featured parts in The Ten Commandments (1956) and Spartacus (1960).In later years Nina was seen less and less, but became a widely respected acting teacher in the Los Angeles area (notably USC) and has directed on stage. She also has been a senior faculty member at the American Film Institute. Recent recurring stints on TV in such shows as ""Bull"" and ""Navy CIS"" confirms the octogenarian is still a lovely and vibrant talent. She also has been given credit as an acting coach from time to time in such films as Encino Man (1992). Married and divorced three times, one of her ex-husbands is the bearded academic and host James Lipton of Inside the Actors Studio (1994) fame on the Bravo cable station. She divorced her third husband, stage producer Michael Dewell, in 1993. Nina has lived in Beverly Hills for the past forty years, and has one child, a son, Dr. Dirk de Brito.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net          Spouse (3) Michael Dewell (31 October\xa01967            - 18 March\xa01993)\xa0(divorced)           Dennis de Brito (27 November\xa01959            - 10 August\xa01963)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)           James Lipton (12 June\xa01954            - 2 February\xa01959)\xa0(divorced)          Trivia (12)      Daughter of Dirk Fock, conductor of the Amsterdams Concertgebouworkest, and actress and singer Consuelo Flowerton.

Lew Landers directed a lot of crap during his long, prolific career,
but when he was on his game, as in The Raven (1934), and this film, he
could produce a horror movie as good as any. The Return of the Vampire
may be nothing more than a little Columbia B picture, but it exhibits
more craft, care, and professionalism than 90 percent of what comes out
of Hollywood today. The foggy, expressionistic photography and sets are
fantastic, with excellent use of shadow and camera movement, and the
early scenes of Lugosi prowling through mist and darkness, shot mostly
from behind, or in silhouette, are striking in their spectral
intensity. Lugosi once again shows why he ranks among the immortals; he
is more commanding and magnetic walking from point A to point B in his
top hat and tails than most actors are emoting through pages of dialog.
Screenwriter Griffin Jay and director Landers go out of their way to
showcase Lugosi's unique talents; he is given a great part with many
substantial scenes to play, and Landers shoots him to his fullest
advantage. Frieda Inescort, as Lugosi's nemesis, is sublimely up to the
challenge, and their scenes together, especially their climactic
confrontation at the pipe organ, are the best in the film. Sure, Return
of the Vampire has its weak elements, such as Matt Willis's unfortunate
talking werewolf, but let them pass. There are few moments in cinema as
inspiring as watching Lugosi at full throttle, and Return of the
Vampire has that in spades.

If you're looking for a movie that will give you some good, old fashioned,
escapism and not try to preach to or lecture you, you will enjoy this
movie.
Lugosi, with the aid of Andreas (his werewolf assistant) is once again
trying to capture the heart and soul of a young woman. But, the young
womans' soon to be mother-in-law is on to Lugosis' plot and a real battle
royale is soon underway. This is a down to earth, old time vampire movie
which takes place during the WW II years. Enjoy it for what it is and
don't
take it too seriously. IMHO, the walking, talking, sharp dressing vampire
assistant is one of the best parts of the story. Andreas has a real inner
conflict while trying to decide whether to  help his evil vampire master
or
to help the heroine rid the earth of this monster.

Bela Lugosi stars as Armand Tesla vampire, but this is the only movie I've

This beautifully shot B&amp;W 1940s vampire film is loaded with the kind of
old
fashioned, spooky atmosphere that fans of classic Gothic horror will love.
The fogbound sets are deliciously creepy, the graveyard &amp; crypt sets
nothing
short of fabulous! The spooky music adds a lot as well. Bela Lugosi, about
60 here and well into the undeserved waning days of his career, is damn
good. Tall, imposing, and as strong a screen prescence as ever, he raises
questions as to why the often heartless and stupid film industry did not
make better use of his talents. He shows here that he could certainly
still
carry a film and command the screen.           But the script needed work.
Matt Willis as the talking werewolf is laughable. When he's seen entering
the graveyard carrying what looks like a package of Chinese laundry, I
howled! I just couldn't see him running shopping errands in his werewolf
garb! And no explanation is offered as to why the vampire's slave turns
into
a werewolf, a state he retains regardless of whether or not the moon is
full. He's a wolf even in broad daylight.  Still, this is a fun, somewhat
creepy film, and Lugosi is always worthy of your time.

I really enjoyed this movie. It was unique in that the Vampire had a
werewolf as his assistant. This werewolf wears a suit, talks, smiles and,
in
general, acts like a normal human being. The movie was basically a sequel
to
Dracula but the vampire played by Bela Lugosi could not use the name
Dracula
because this was a Columbia picture and Universal Studios had the legal
rights to the Dracula character. But, it was still Lugosi at his scary,
pompous best.
</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>
This has got to be one of Bela's most underrated performances, a bright
spot among the dreariness of Monogram potboilers. Columbia allows him
to both reference Dracula while at the same time expanding the
definition of vampirism by having him play Dr. Armand Tessla, the
""depraved Roumanian scientist"" who is so obsessed with evil that he
actually becomes a bloodsucker. (there is also a nifty sketch of Lugosi
drawn in a book about his character) Lugosi is alternately sinister,
avuncular, lovestruck, arrogant, and commanding. His voice, usually
cause for laughter at its ripe indelibility, is used extremely
effectively as a whisper when he is calling Nina Foch into the
graveyard. (""Just a little bit further--further--further!"") This is
actually quite eerie. His exchanges with Matt Willis are atmospheric
and believable, in that someone undead would naturally have
supernatural acolytes surrounding him. (so what if they sprout facial
hair; that just gives the acolyte more ""texture"") I have to disagree
with viewers who think Willis is ridiculous as a talking wolf; I happen
to think he's the best thing in the film. Willis' natural speaking
voice is kind of strange, half Southern, half something..and when he's
the werewolf with those teeth his line readings are really creepy. My
favorite is when he's saying ""as if they could tell what happened!"" and
then he chuckles. He is really effective. The whole production is sort
of tongue in cheek and the Britishness at its height. (Frieda Inescort:
""The Gerries have rather taken things out of your hands"") The WWII
element adds more interest, and Lugosi has a droll line that he is
going out of his hotel but, ""whether I can be reached is another
matter."" A jarring note is Foch's boyfriend, who has ""Lady Jane"" as his
mother and yet speaks with a German or Dutch accent. All in all, a must
for Lugosi fans and all other horror film fans interested in how
Columbia does this kind of movie as opposed to Universal.

It's interesting that even though Bela Lugosi enjoys an eternal
reputation of playing the most imitated vampire of all (the legendary
Count Dracula), the actor really didn't star as a true bloodsucker in
that many motion pictures. But he's nothing less than the real deal
here, in an enjoyably misty and moody horror offering which was
produced by Columbia Pictures, yet could be easily mistaken for any one
of the 1940s classics that Universal Studios was churning out at this
time.<br><br>Though Bela looks and sounds much like Dracula with his trademark
flowing cape and piercing eyes, this time he plays a different
character called Armand Tesla, a vampire who rises from his grave in
ravaged WW II times to seek revenge many years after being destroyed
with a metal spike. Frieda Inescort is a welcome change of pace as a
female ""Van Helsing"" type of protector, and the Lon Chaney-ish Matt
Willis is cast as a pitiable servant named Andreas, who becomes
corrupted by Tesla and is transformed into a werewolf that TALKS!
Adding this hirsute Renfield character in fangs and fur was possibly an
effort by Columbia to compete with Universal's current monster rally,
FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN. Nina Foch is the pretty young damsel
in distress whom the vampire plots to possess. Fans of Bela Lugosi and
the classic old Universal monster movies will not want to skip this
one. *** out of ****

In the 18th-century, Dr. Armand Tesla, a ""depraved"" Romanian scientist,
developed an unhealthy obsession with the supernatural--vampires in
particular--and became a foul creature of the night shortly after his
death. Flash forward to 1918 and Tesla, with the help of his rather
pathetic werewolf slave, has relocated to a desolate cemetery in
London. After preying on the young niece of the intrepid scientist
Walter Saunders, who immediately deduces a vampire is on the loose,
Saunders and his colleague Lady Jane Ainsley find the vampire in his
lair &amp; drive a spike through his heart.<br><br>Twenty-five years later, German bombers disturb the cemetery where
Tesla lays at rest &amp; two cockney civil-defense workers remove the stake
from the vampire's unearthed body. That night, Tesla sets out to
reclaim his now reformed flunky, Andreas, whose ""iron-will"" shows
through as it takes no more than a few minutes in Tesla's presence
before he's furring out again. The vampire sets out to take revenge on
those responsible for his quarter-century dirtnap, but like all
malevolent beings in these types of horror films, his cruel
mistreatment of his servant will eventually come back to bite him...<br><br>""The Return of the Vampire"", while no masterpiece, is chock full of
some wonderful atmosphere &amp; images: the fog-bound cemeteries, Lugosi's
outstretched cape, the entranced young beauty (Nina Foch) hypnotically
walking through the graveyard. Speaking of those graveyards, have you
ever stopped to wonder how this vampire can be so repulsed when a cross
is shoved in his face, yet has no trouble stalking around cemeteries
littered with giant stone-crosses.<br><br>Lugosi, of course, still has his vampire-mojo working, his line
readings being as priceless as ever. As for his servant, was there any
point in subjecting Matt Willis to a werewolf makeup, aside from
Columbia feeling the need to jump on the bandwagon in light of that
""Wolf Man"" character that was making money for Universal Pictures.
Matt's role could've just as easily been played as a totally human
lapdog (ala Renfield). Being in a lycanthropic state doesn't enhance
the character in anyway--the only thing the fur does is give Willis the
dubious distinction of being one of the sorriest specimens of werewolf
to prowl through a Hollywood movie.

I watched this Lugosi outing he made at Columbia a second time as well,
and I guess I can say that I liked it better now too. The atmosphere
really is everything in this one as the film is enveloped in fog and
the prowling camera-work is top-notch throughout; despite being clearly
a B-movie, the film's production values are more polished than in most
of Universal's stuff of this period! Lugosi isn't offered anything new
to do here but he is suitably authoritative in his role of Armand
Tesla; until he reprised the role of Dracula one last time in ABBOTT &amp;
COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN (1948), this was arguably his best work of
the 40s (which I admit isn't saying much). The contributions of the
rest of the cast - Frieda Inescort (for once the vampire expert/hunter
is a woman!), Miles Mander, Nina Foch and Gilbert Emery - are quite
professional as well. Matt Willis is not bad as a man enslaved by
Lugosi and turned by him into a werewolf(!) and, even though the
character's psychological torment is as palpable as that of Lon Chaney
Jr.'s Larry Talbot in the Universal ""Wolf Man"" saga, the actor is
defeated by the shaggy-dog make-up, the fact that he is allowed to
speak when transformed(!!) and, well, the very pointlessness of his
presence since he never does much at all except serve Lugosi (a task
which could easily have been handled by a mere human, who would
certainly have aroused a great deal less suspicion than a werewolf)!
The climax, while somewhat abrupt, is nicely handled.

Vampire.<br><br>In this vampire movie, a vampire is staked during World War 1 but then
in the Second World War, two gravediggers bury him again after an air

I watched this Lugosi outing he made at Columbia a second time as well,
and I guess I can say that I liked it better now too. The atmosphere
really is everything in this one as the film is enveloped in fog and
the prowling camera-work is top-notch throughout; despite being clearly
a B-movie, the film's production values are more polished than in most
of Universal's stuff of this period! Lugosi isn't offered anything new
to do here but he is suitably authoritative in his role of Armand
Tesla; until he reprised the role of Dracula one last time in ABBOTT &amp;
COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN (1948), this was arguably his best work of
the 40s (which I admit isn't saying much). The contributions of the
rest of the cast - Frieda Inescort (for once the vampire expert/hunter
is a woman!), Miles Mander, Nina Foch and Gilbert Emery - are quite
professional as well. Matt Willis is not bad as a man enslaved by
Lugosi and turned by him into a werewolf(!) and, even though the
character's psychological torment is as palpable as that of Lon Chaney
Jr.'s Larry Talbot in the Universal ""Wolf Man"" saga, the actor is
defeated by the shaggy-dog make-up, the fact that he is allowed to
speak when transformed(!!) and, well, the very pointlessness of his
presence since he never does much at all except serve Lugosi (a task
which could easily have been handled by a mere human, who would
certainly have aroused a great deal less suspicion than a werewolf)!
The climax, while somewhat abrupt, is nicely handled.

He and his older brother David were raised first in Dulwich Village, a south London suburb, and then later back in Surrey. At an early age, Cushing was attracted to acting, inspired by his favorite aunt, who was a stage actress. While at school, Cushing pursued his acting interest in acting and also drawing, a talent he put to good use later in his first job as a government surveyor\'s assistant in Surrey. At this time, he also dabbled in local amateur theater until moving to London to attend the Guildhall School of Music and Drama on scholarship. He then performed in repertory theater, deciding in 1939 to head for Hollywood, where he made his film debut in The Man in the Iron Mask (1939). Other Hollywood films included A Chump at Oxford (1940) with Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, Vigil in the Night (1940) and They Dare Not Love (1941). However, after a short stay, he returned to England by way of New York (making brief appearances on Broadway) and Canada. Back in his homeland, he contributed to the war effort during World War II by joining the Entertainment National Services Association.After the war, he performed in the West End and had his big break appearing with Laurence Olivier in Hamlet (1948), in which Cushing\'s future partner-in-horror Christopher Lee had a bit part. Both actors also appeared in Moulin Rouge (1952) but did not meet until their later horror films. During the 1950s, Cushing became a familiar face on British television, appearing in numerous teleplays, such as 1984 (1954) and Beau Brummell (1954), until the end of the decade when he began his legendary association with Hammer Film Productions in its remakes of the 1930s Universal horror classics. His first Hammer roles included Dr. Frankenstein in The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), Dr. Van Helsing in Dracula (1958), and Sherlock Holmes in The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959).Cushing continued playing the roles of Drs. Frankenstein and Van Helsing, as well as taking on other horror characters, in Hammer films over the next 20 years. He also appeared in films for the other major horror producer of the time, Amicus Productions, including Dr. Terror\'s House of Horrors (1965) and its later horror anthologies, a couple of Dr. Who films (1965, 1966), I, Monster (1971), and others. By the mid-1970s, these companies had stopped production, but Cushing, firmly established as a horror star, continued in the genre for some time thereafter.Perhaps his best-known appearance outside of horror films was as Grand Moff Tarkin in George Lucas\' phenomenally successful science fiction film Star Wars (1977). Biggles (1986) was Cushing\'s last film before his retirement, during which he made a few television appearances, wrote two autobiographies and pursued his hobbies of bird watching and painting. In 1989, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his contributions to the acting profession in Britain and worldwide. Peter Cushing died at age 81 of prostate cancer on August 11, 1994.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Lyn Hammond          Spouse (1)               Violet Helene Beck          (10 April\xa01943            - 14 January\xa01971)\xa0(her death)          Trade Mark (5)        Chilly but mellifluous voice, often used to menacing effect        Often appeared with his good friend Christopher Lee        Many roles in Hammer Horror films        Prominent cheekbones and piercing blue eyes        Thin frameTrivia (49)      He turned down Donald Pleasence\'s role as Dr. Sam Loomis in Halloween (1978).      He considered The Blood Beast Terror (1968) to be the worst film he ever made.      The costume boots they gave Cushing for Star Wars (1977) were too small and hurt his feet. Cushing told George Lucas this, and asked if he could wear slippers instead. Lucas agreed, and shot Cushing from the waist up for nearly all his scenes to compensate for Cushing\'s slippers.      He was an artist, skilled in drawing and painting; as a young struggling actor, he supplemented his income by selling scarves that he hand-painted and later, as an established actor, had showings of his water colors.      He withdrew from the film Blood from the Mummy\'s Tomb (1971) due to the death of his wife. His role was assumed by Andrew Keir.      He was guest of honor at the Famous Monsters of Filmland Convention in New York City in 1975. After receiving a thunderous ovation from those in attendance, he looked at everyone and said, ""Have you ever felt unloved?"".      His sketch of Sherlock Holmes became the official logo for the Northern Musgraves, a British Sherlock Holmes society.      He was preferred to original Doctor Who (1963) lead actor William Hartnell as star of Dr. Who and the Daleks (1965) because he was more widely recognized by American audiences.      During a television interview, he confessed that fellow actor Christopher Lee had telephoned him earlier that evening to ""Wish me luck!"".      He was good friends with Christopher Lee. After he died, Lee said in an interview that he never felt closer and more open to any of his other friends than he felt to Peter.Carrie Fisher said in an interview that doing her scenes with him in Star Wars (1977) were difficult for two reasons: she thought the lines were ridiculous and she found Peter to be so polite and charming off camera that it was hard to project the sense of disdain that her character, Princess Leia Organa, held for his character, Grand Moff Tarkin.George Lucas originally planned to use archival footage of Cushing from Star Wars (1977) for insertion into Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005). This would have made Episode III Cushing\'s final, albeit posthumous, collaboration with Christopher Lee. However, none of the footage was suitable to Lucas\' needs. This may be because Grand Moff Tarkin only appears in long shots, due to the pain associated with wearing the boots Cushing was wearing. Therefore, Wayne Pygram was cast, and made to wear prosthetic make-up so that he would resemble Cushing. It was not until Rogue One (2016) that archive footage of Cushing could be digitally used to recreate an entire performance of his Tarkin character.      Prior to casting Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin in Star Wars (1977), George Lucas considered using him as Obi-Wan Kenobi (a role that ultimately went to Alec Guinness).      In his later years, he and Joyce DeWitt of Three\'s Company (1976) fame became transatlantic pen pals, when the two became part of the voice-over ensemble for the animated film Walpurgis Night. Peter recorded his role in England, while Joyce later commenced recording in California, alongside his old friend Ferdy Mayne. It was during this time that Joyce, being a fan of both classic films and Shakespeare\'s works, and Peter, an admirer of the American West, enjoyed their friendship by post.      He was described by many presenters as the best interviewee they had.      He wrote to BBC program Jim\'ll Fix It (1975) asking that a new rose be bred and named after his late wife. Jimmy Savile agreed and the process was filmed ending with the creation of a new strain of yellow rose being presented to Peter.      Cushing reprised his role, with dialog, from his last film Biggles (1986) in the video for the movie\'s theme song ""No Turning Back"" by The Immortals. He appears at the end to tell the camera: ""I\'m a restless sort of guy."" Technically, this makes it his last performance and his last line of dialog.      He had appeared as Osric in Hamlet (1948). This was also his first film with Christopher Lee. Alec Guinness also played Osric in John Gielgud\'s 1934 theatrical production. Cushing, Lee and Guinness all later appeared in the Star Wars films.      He was the only one of the main characters from Star Wars not to appear in the sequels (for the obvious reason).      He was so ubiquitous on live television in Britain in the early 1950s that one popular comedian joked: ""You know what television is, don\'t you? It\'s Peter Cushing with knobs"".      He was awarded the OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in the 1989 Queen\'s New Year Honours List for his services to drama.      He was originally cast as Dr. Vesalius in The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971), but declined as his wife was in poor health at the time.      He bought a seafront home in 1959 in Whitstable, Kent, England upon retiring. There is a pub there today dedicated to his memory, ""The Peter Cushing"".      He and Christopher Lee appeared together in two films outside of the Hammer Studio Horror genre: their first film together was Hamlet (1948), and they appeared together in Moulin Rouge (1952). They later went to appear in separate films in the Star Wars series: Cushing in Star Wars (1977), and Lee in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005). They would also appear separately in adaptations of Alexandre Dumas pere\'s Musketeer novels: Cushing appeared in The Man in the Iron Mask (1939), while Lee appeared in The Three Musketeers (1973), The Four Musketeers (1974) and The Return of the Musketeers (1989).      Although he and Christopher Lee were often mortal enemies on-screen, off-screen they were inseparable friends.      In 1945 with no money for presents, he found a large piece of silk, cut it into a neat square, painted Dickens characters on it and gave it to his wife as a present. She later loaned it to a friend who wore it to a party where it was seen by a textile manufacturer who gave Peter a contract as a silk scarf designer. Amongst those he designed were those for the Festival of Britain and the Coronation.      He made seven films with Michael Ripper: The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958), The Mummy (1959), The Brides of Dracula (1960), Torture Garden (1967), The Creeping Flesh (1973) and Legend of the Werewolf (1975).      Along with Arnold MarlÃ© and Wolfe Morris, he was one of only three actors to reprise their roles from BBC Sunday-Night Theatre: The Creature (1955) in the film remake The Abominable Snowman (1957).      He appeared in 13 films directed by Terence Fisher: The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), Dracula (1958), The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958), The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959), The Mummy (1959), The Brides of Dracula (1960), Sword of Sherwood Forest (1960), The Gorgon (1964), Island of Terror (1966), Frankenstein Created Woman (1967), Night of the Big Heat (1967), Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969) and Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell (1974).      He made five films with Miles Malleson: Dracula (1958), The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959), The Brides of Dracula (1960), The Hellfire Club (1961) and Fury at Smugglers\' Bay (1961).      He was the brother-in-law of Reginald Beck.      He was considered for the role of Dr. Hans Fallanda, Sir Percy Heseltine and Dr. Armstrong in Lifeforce (1985).      He made four films with Michael Gough: Dracula (1958), Dr. Terror\'s House of Horrors (1965), The Skull (1965) and Top Secret! (1984). The last film is the only one of the four in which Christopher Lee did not also appear.      Whitstable based British band The Jellybottys has written a song about him, with lyrics about him living in Whitstable, riding on his bicycle and buying vegetables. The song is called: Peter Cushing lives in Whitstable.      He made four films with Patrick Troughton: Hamlet (1948), The Black Knight (1954), The Gorgon (1964) and Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell (1974). Of the four films, The Black Knight (1954) is the only one in which Christopher Lee did not also appear.      He appeared in a total of 24 films with his close friend Christopher Lee: Hamlet (1948), Moulin Rouge (1952), Alexander the Great (1956), The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), Dracula (1958), The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959), The Mummy (1959), The Devil\'s Agent (1962), The Gorgon (1964), Dr. Terror\'s House of Horrors (1965), She (1965), The Skull (1965), Night of the Big Heat (1967), Scream and Scream Again (1970), One More Time (1970), The House That Dripped Blood (1971), I, Monster (1971), Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972), Horror Express (1972), Nothing But the Night (1973), The Creeping Flesh (1973), The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973), Arabian Adventure (1979) and House of the Long Shadows (1983).      He had three roles in common with his Hamlet (1948) co-star Laurence Olivier: (1) Olivier played Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice (1940) while Cushing played him in Pride and Prejudice (1952), (2) Cushing played Rudolf Hess in You Are There: The Escape of Rudolf Hess (1953) while Olivier played him in Wild Geese II (1985) and (3) Cushing played Professor Van Helsing in Dracula (1958), The Brides of Dracula (1960), Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972), The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973) and The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974) while Olivier played him in Dracula (1979).      He has two roles in common with Christopher Plummer: (1) Cushing played Sherlock Holmes in The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959), Sherlock Holmes (1964) and The Masks of Death (1984) while Plummer played him in The Sunday Drama: Silver Blaze (1977) and Murder by Decree (1979) and (2) Cushing played Professor Van Helsing in Dracula (1958), The Brides of Dracula (1960), Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972), The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973) and The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974) while Plummer played him in Dracula 2000 (2000).      He has two roles in common with Tom Baker: (1) Cushing played Sherlock Holmes in The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959), Sherlock Holmes (1964) and The Masks of Death (1984) while Baker played him in The Hound of the Baskervilles (1982) and (2) Baker played the Doctor in Doctor Who (1963) while Cushing played him in Dr. Who and the Daleks (1965) and Daleks\' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D. (1966).      Both he and his Asylum (1972) and And Now the Screaming Starts! (1973) co-star Herbert Lom played Professor Van Helsing in films starring Christopher Lee as Count Dracula: Cushing in Dracula (1958), Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972) and The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973) and Lom in Nachts, wenn Dracula erwacht (1970). Cushing also played the role in The Brides of Dracula (1960) and The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974), in which Lee did not appear.

The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958), The Evil of Frankenstein (1964), Frankenstein Created Woman (1967), Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969), One More Time (1970) and Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell (1974), Price played him in DrÃ¡cula contra Frankenstein (1972) and La maldiciÃ³n de Frankenstein (1973) and Brooks played him in Young Frankenstein (1974) and (2) Cushing played Professor Van Helsing in Dracula (1958), The Brides of Dracula (1960), Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972), The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973) and The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974), Price played him in Son of Dracula (1974) and Brooks played him in Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995).      He was an ardent vegetarian for most of his life and was the patron of the Vegetarian Society from 1987 until his death.      After retiring from acting, he wrote and illustrated a children\'s book of Lewis Carroll-style humor, The Bois Saga.      He played Sherlock Holmes in The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959), Sherlock Holmes (1964) and The Masks of Death (1984) and his creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in The Great Houdini (1976).

He died only four days after his Torture Garden (1967) and Tales from the Crypt (1972) co-star Robert Hutton.      He appeared in three films nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture: Hamlet (1948), Moulin Rouge (1952) and Star Wars (1977). Hamlet won Best Picture.      In addition to starring in Dr. Who and the Daleks (1965) and Daleks\' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D. (1966), he was considered for many guest roles in Doctor Who (1963) - Solon in ""The Brain of Morbius"", General Grugger in ""Meglos"", Borusa in ""Arc of Infinity"", Azmael in ""The Twin Dilemma"", Lord Ravensworth in ""The Mark of the Rani"", Dastari in ""The Two Doctors"" and De Flores in ""Silver Nemesis"". He was also considered for Borusa in Doctor Who (1996) before the character was removed from the script.      He and his best friend Christopher Lee were once asked to leave a theater showing a Sylvester and Tweety cartoon, because they were laughing hysterically.Personal Quotes (25)      Who wants to see me as Hamlet? Very few. But millions want to see me as Frankenstein so that\'s the one I do.      If I played Hamlet, they\'d call it a horror film.      Teeth are a vitally important part of an actor\'s equipment. I have over 30 toothbrushes at home and always keep a good supply at the studio.      I hate the word \'hate\'.      [on the wig he had to wear for Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell (1974)] It made me look like Helen Hayes.      ""You have to have a sense of humour, darling, to be alive. Even a bit mad. It helps to be mad."" - (1991)      ""People look at me as if I were some sort of monster, but I can\'t think why. In my macabre pictures, I have either been a monster-maker or a monster-destroyer, but never a monster. Actually, I\'m a gentle fellow. Never harmed a fly. I love animals, and when I\'m in the country I\'m a keen bird-watcher."" - ABC Film Review (Nov 1964)      There is little chance for a person to exercise the imagination today in this complex, programmed society we have.      Since Helen passed on I can\'t find anything; the heart, quite simply, has gone out of everything. Time is interminable, the loneliness is almost unbearable and the only thing that keeps me going is the knowledge that my dear Helen and I will be united again some day. To join Helen is my only ambition. You have my permission to publish that... really, you know dear boy, it\'s all just killing time. Please say that. - Radio Times 1972      ""You cannot make a film like this without integrity. To make the audiences believe in you, you must believe utterly in what you are doing."" - (1972)      My criterion for accepting a role isn\'t based on what I would like to do. I try to consider what the audience would like to see me do and I thought kids would adore Star Wars (1977).      ""Strangely enough, I don\'t like horror pictures at all. I love to make them because they give pleasure to people, but my favourite types of films are much more subtle than horror. I like to watch films like The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), The Apartment (1960) or lovely musicals."" - (1980s)      As far back as I can remember, I had a passion for \'dressing up\' and playing games of \'Let\'s Pretend\', which are, of course, the basic principals of acting, and if you are lucky enough, you get paid for so doing, hard work though it may be.      When Helen passed on six years ago I lost the only joy in life that I ever wanted. She was my whole life and without her there is no meaning. I am simply killing time, so to speak, until that wonderful day when we are together again.      Television is rather a frightening business. But I get all the relaxation I want from my collection of model soldiers.      There are all sorts of reasons why I don\'t do much work in the theater, the main one being that after two performances I feel I\'ve given all I can. I hate repetition, I really do. It\'s like asking a painter to paint he same picture every day of his life.      In the early days I played a lot of comedy in the theater and on television. But once an actor becomes well known in any kind of part, he tends to get stereotyped. After I played Frankenstein, I was only thought of in that light. Of course, some actors are better at drama and some are better at comedy. But they can certainly have a stab at both. An actor should be able to do it all.      ""It gives me the most wonderful feeling. These dear people love me so much and want to see me. The astonishing thing is that when I made the Frankenstein and Dracula movies almost 30 years ago the young audiences who see me now weren\'t even born yet. A new generation has grown up with my films. And the original audiences are still able to see me in new pictures. So, as long as these films are made I will have a life in this business -- for which I\'m eternally grateful."" (from a 1985 ""Starlog"" interview)      An actor\'s job is to entertain and I\'m glad to say that my films succeeded in that respect.      [on Vincent Price] A dear, charming man with a great sense of humor. Strictly a professional, who cares far more about his work than he allows the public to know. I am extremely fond of him and bask in his gentle kindness and warmth.      Every part is approached in the same manner - gleaning all I can from what the author has written. When called for, I add reaction to any given circumstance such as I\'ve witnessed and observed in others through life, applying the emotion in terms of the character as opposed to the way I might react personally.      [advice to Simon Ward, who was delivering his lines at an urgent pace] Now you know, dear boy, that at the end of every line leave a very tiny gap so they can get the scissors in.      [on The Curse of Frankenstein (1957)] No-one had any idea it would be successful. It took the world by storm. The whole thing only cost 65,000 pounds. You wouldn\'t be able to get a lead actor for that today.      If I feel I can\'t put out 100 percent, it\'s not really fair to anyone who\'s come to watch for me to go on creaking around. You need such energy. I love it, mind you. But you\'ve got to be like athlete Zola Budd to work, which I\'m not.      We had Dracula among the kung fu in Hong Kong. It was called The Something of the Seven Golden Dragons, Dracula and The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974). But I still had to drive a stake through Dracula\'s heart ... Once you\'ve done Frankenstein, who creates the impossible, and Dracula, a man who drinks blood ... you\'ve got to keep it on. It\'s awfully difficult to bring the changes up to date.

He was the son of Alphonse Frankenstein and Caroline Beaufort, who died of scarlet fever when Frankenstein was 17. Frankenstein has two younger brothersWilliam, the youngest, and Ernest, the middle child. As a boy, Frankenstein is interested in the works of alchemists such as Cornelius Agrippa, Paracelsus, and Albertus Magnus, and he longs to discover the fabled elixir of life. He loses interest in both these pursuits and in science as a whole after seeing the remains of a tree struck by lightning; however, at the University of Ingolstadt, Frankenstein develops a fondness for chemistry, and becomes obsessed with the idea of creating life in inanimate matter through artificial means, pursuing this goal for two years.Assembling a humanoid creature perhaps by the use of a chemical, apparatus or a combination of both (he avoids the question three times when asked), Frankenstein successfully brings it to life, but he is horrified by the creature\'s ugliness. He abandons and flees his creation, who disappears and soon embarks upon a journey of vengeance that results in the death of Frankenstein\'s younger brother, William.

The creature keeps his promise by strangling Elizabeth Lavenza on her matrimonial bed. That same night, Frankenstein\'s father dies of grief. With nothing else left to live for, Frankenstein dedicates his life to destroying the creature.Frankenstein pursues the ""fiend"" or ""Demon"" (as he calls his creation) to the Arctic with the intent of destroying it; he ultimately fails in his mission, as he falls through an ice floe and contracts severe pneumonia.

The second entry in the noble Frankenstein series produced by Hammer and Â
as always Â a joy to watch. Largely thanks to the performance of Peter
Cushing who became one with this  protagonist for 6 entire movies. Cushing
perfectly knows who to make the most out of his character. As a viewer, you
don't know whether to have sympathy for himÂor despise him. He's a dedicated
and hardworking scientist, yet he's doesn't seem to care much about human
emotions and he's ultimately cruel. The screenplay by Jimmy Sangster is
well-written and rather originalÂthe development of the Âmonster' is
completely different than usual and the script contains a lot of twisted and
sadistic humor. The Revenge of Frankenstein has two extraordinary good
sequences. Namely the entire beginning in which the Baron is brought to the
Guillotine, condemned for the crimes against humanity he did in the past
(The Curse of Frankenstein Â 1956). This entire opening to the movie is very
atmospheric, morbid and the perfect launch for a decent horror movie.
Secondly, there is the magnificent climax containing an
experiment-gone-wrong that brutally interrupts a high society party. This
particular scene is the start for a very suspenseful finale with a few
shocking parts and a terrific end scene. Certainly a must for all Cushing-,
Fisher- and Hammer-fans and a nice waste of time for everyone with a little
sympathy towards the genre of horror. Recommended!

Released just a year after ""Curse of Frankenstein,"" ""Revenge of
Frankenstein"" chronicles the further adventures of Baron Victor
Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) as he miraculously escapes the guillotine
(his fate at the end of the first movie), relocates to a new town
(Carlsbruck), assumes a new identity (Dr. Stein), and seemingly becomes
a respectable citizen. Before long, however, the doc is up to his old
tricks, collecting body parts and transplanting a brain into a new
stitched-together creature. This time, his experiment seems to be a
rousing success. However, things soon go awry.<br><br>Like the 1935 Universal classic ""Bride of Frankenstein,"" this is one of
those rare sequels that surpasses the original. Although ""Revenge"" is
not quite in the same league as ""Bride,"" The Creature (played by
Michael Gwynne) is a much more complicated, and therefore more
interesting, character than Christopher Lee's Frankenstein Monster, who
was basically just a homicidal maniac. Karl (The Creature) is not evil,
merely misunderstood and terribly unlucky.<br><br>Peter Cushing's Baron Frankenstein is also a much more sympathetic
character than he was in ""Curse of Frankenstein."" There he did not
hesitate to engage in cold-blooded murder to further his goals. Here we
have a kinder and gentler Baron, resolute to be sure but not
murderously ruthless. This remarkable character transformation is never
explained nor even alluded to. But it makes the Baron a character we
can root for, something that we could never do in the original movie.
In that regard, the title is somewhat misleading, since revenge is not
a major theme and the Baron is not out to get those who may have
wronged him.<br><br>The same steady hands who guided Hammer's first ""Frankenstein"" film to
box-office success -- Terence Fisher as director and Jimmy Sangster as
screenwriter -- are also at the helm in this one. Cushing's presence
adds a certain gravitas to the proceedings, and the other actors,
particularly Gwynne, also turn in first-rate performances. Although
there are few scares, the movie is well written and maintains the
viewer's interest throughout.<br><br>It should be noted that, like most of Hammer's Frankenstein sequels,
this one chronicles the further adventures of Victor Frankenstein and
not the Frankenstein Monster. In that respect, they are quite unlike
the Universal sequels, where the Monster eventually ran out of things
to do and ended up being a virtual parody of himself. The original
Monster would, in fact, return in the next Hammer sequel, ""The Evil of
Frankenstein,"" and again a few years later in ""Horror of Frankenstein,""
which was a remake of ""Curse"" (this time with Ralph Bates as the Baron)
rather than a sequel. Both of these films, while enjoyable in their own
way (particularly for Hammerphiles), are inferior to this one and, in
my opinion, not as good as the other sequels (most notably
""Frankenstein Created Woman"") that do not feature the original
Frankenstein Monster.<br><br>Highly recommended.

Direct sequel to ""Curse of Frankenstein"" is just as good. Dr.
Frankenstein escapes the guillotine, changes his name to Dr. Stein,
moves to another town and begins his experiments again. Naturally
things go all wrong.<br><br>The story moves quickly and is very interesting, the color
cinematography is just simply superb, the set design is exquisite and
the acting is all good. Peter Cushing gives another great portrayal as
the Baron--it's a wonder this man never got the praise he deserved, he
was an excellent actor. Also Michael Gwynn gives a good performance as
a result of the doctor's experiments.<br><br>It's not really scary and there's no real monster, but the plot is so
interesting you don't really care! Well worth watching. A must see for
the color alone.

Baron Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) is sentenced to the
guillotine but he succeeds to escape facilitated by the hunchback Karl
Immelmann (Michael Gwynn) to Carlsbruck in Germany adopting the alias
Doctor Victor Stein. Three years later, he is a successful physician in
a poor hospital. Doctor Hans Kleve (Francis Matthews) recognizes
Frankenstein and blackmails him to be his assistant. Dr. Stein shows a
perfect body and tells to Dr. Kleve that Karl will donate his brain to
a healthy body. They successfully transplant Karl's brain to the new
body and Dr. Stein hides Karl in the attic. However a snoopy janitor
(George Woodbridge) witnesses the transportation to the room and tells
to the nurse Margaret Conrad (Eunice Gayson) that the doctors have
hidden a patient in the attic. Meanwhile Dr. Kleve comments with Karl
that he will become a medical sensation and Karl is afraid of the
situation. When Margaret finds Karl in the attic, he convinces her to
release the straps that hold him to the bed. Karl runs to Dr. Steins's
laboratory but he is attacked by a man that believes that he is a
burglar. When Dr. Stein and Dr. Kleve arrive in the laboratory, Karl
has already gone leaving two deaths on his path. What will happen to
Karl and to Dr. Frankenstein?<br><br>""The Revenge of Frankenstein"" is a good sequel of ""Frankenstein""
despite the title since there is no revenge. This is a good movie from
Hammer and that is not a surprise having director Terence Fisher and
Peter Cushing in the cast. Dr. Frankenstein giving explanations to Dr.
Kleve about his transplantation procedure is very funny. My vote is

""The Revenge Of Frankenstein"" shows just how good, with the right
director, and cast, a horror film can be. Most horror film fans know
that Baron Frankenstein was a lot more interesting than his creation.
Hammer, wisely chose to follow the exploits and give more screen time
to Baron Frankenstein. Peter Cushing turns in a superb performance as
the Baron, Francis Matthews is quite capable as his assistant, Dr. Hans
Kleve, and Michael Gwynn is very good as ""Karl"" Dr. Frankensteins'
creation. This film picks up where ""The Curse Of Frankenstein"" ended.
Along with ""Horror Of Dracula"", ""The Brides Of Dracula"", ""Night
Creatures"", ""The Mummy"", And ""The Curse Of Frankenstein"", these are my
favorite Hammer Horror Films. Sit back and enjoy. John R. Tracy.

Revenge of Frankenstein is the only true sequel in the successful
Hammer series.  It is interesting to note,  that principal photography
began scant days after the completion of 'Horror of Dracula,'  and it
does not require a trained eye to see the re-dressed and painted 
Dracula sets  throughout the film.  Production Designer,  Bernard
Robinson,  and Director,  Terence Fisher both told me the paint on
some of the flats had yet to dry when shooting began.
Peter Cushing had the opportunity to refine and develop his portrayal
as the driven Baron Frankenstein.  His dialogue is caustic,  witty and
at times humorous.  This again was the Golden Age of  Hammer, 
that magic period that lasted but a short time.  The team of
Fisher,
Robinson,  Lighting Cameraman,  Jack Asher, and a completely
dedicated cast and crew shines as brightly as those newly painted
sets.  One of the best of the period,  and still plays well today.

OK so maybe not. Even though this movie is called ""The Revenge of
Frankenstein"" and the baron himself, who escaped the guillotine, also
tells that he is planning on taking revenge, he never does so in this
movie. Sloppy perhaps and also a missed opportunity. Nevertheless ""The
Revenge of Frankenstein"" remains one of the best put together and most
atmospheric Hammer movie. Esecially for late '50's standards, this
movie is a surprising good and effective one that more than serves its
purpose and has plenty enough to offer the viewer.<br><br>The story is well written and told, which is the main reason why this
movie works out great. It also helps to make this movie one of the
better ones out of the long line of Hammer Frankenstein movies. It's an
interesting movie to watch with a great perfect horror atmosphere, all
combined with the typical Hammer studio's style. The movie also
features some morbid humor which suits the style of the movie even
better and makes it an even more pleasant and entertaining one to
watch.<br><br>Unlike other Frankenstein movies this movie relies on original and self
developed and written elements. The Hammer studios throughout this way,
practically recreated the entire character of baron Frankenstein, with
its long line of Hammer Frankenstein movies. When I now think of baron
Frankenstein, I automatically think of Peter Cushing portraying him,
thanks to the Hammer movies.<br><br>The movie doesn't waste any time on things like character development,
which is also the reason why the movie is only 89 minutes short. It
makes the story flow well, without any drags or unnecessary moments but
one of the consequences also is that some of the characters don't quite
work out because of this, such as the Eunice Gayson character, who
doesn't seem to serve a purpose in the movie. The movie also doesn't
have enough emotional depth because of this. Even though the movie does
some attempts to give the movie some depth, mainly in its sequences
with the monster, the movie is too short and distant to really care
about any of it. But at least they did a worthy attempt, which makes
this movie an improvement over the first Hammer Frankenstein movie ""The
Curse of Frankenstein"".<br><br>Peter Cushing is really great as the baron who has taken the name Dr.
Stein, after escaping from the guillotine, to conceal his true
identity. Cushing really seem at ease with his role and he draws all of
the attention of the movie toward him. Unlike most other Frankenstein
movies the Hammer Frankenstein movies aren't really about the creature
but more about baron Frankenstein and his eternal morbid search for
cheating the death and creating life. It's a good thing that this movie
is about the baron and not really about the monster, for the actor who
plays the monster in this movie (Michael Gwynn) is exactly convincing
or a good enough actor. Further more the movie does feature some good
British actors for the smaller parts of the movie, who all seem to fit
their parts very well. <br><br>Through its atmosphere the movie does manages to create an overall
overly present creepy atmosphere which does provide the movie with some
good horror moments as well. Of course nothing too scary, since
obviously all Hammer movies are obviously more entertaining than scary
or serious. The movie also does feature some nice looking sets,
costumes and effects which help to set up the mood.<br><br>A must-see for the Hammer fans, mainly thanks to its well written and
told story.<br><br>8/10<br><br>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

stitched-together creature. This time, his experiment seems to be a
rousing success. However, things soon go awry.<br><br>Like the 1935 Universal classic ""Bride of Frankenstein,"" this is one of
those rare sequels that surpasses the original. Although ""Revenge"" is
not quite in the same league as ""Bride,"" The Creature (played by
Michael Gwynne) is a much more complicated, and therefore more
interesting, character than Christopher Lee's Frankenstein Monster, who
was basically just a homicidal maniac. Karl (The Creature) is not evil,
merely misunderstood and terribly unlucky.<br><br>Peter Cushing's Baron Frankenstein is also a much more sympathetic
character than he was in ""Curse of Frankenstein."" There he did not
hesitate to engage in cold-blooded murder to further his goals. Here we
have a kinder and gentler Baron, resolute to be sure but not
murderously ruthless. This remarkable character transformation is never
explained nor even alluded to. But it makes the Baron a character we
can root for, something that we could never do in the original movie.
In that regard, the title is somewhat misleading, since revenge is not
a major theme and the Baron is not out to get those who may have
wronged him.<br><br>The same steady hands who guided Hammer's first ""Frankenstein"" film to
box-office success -- Terence Fisher as director and Jimmy Sangster as
screenwriter -- are also at the helm in this one. Cushing's presence
adds a certain gravitas to the proceedings, and the other actors,
particularly Gwynne, also turn in first-rate performances. Although
there are few scares, the movie is well written and maintains the
viewer's interest throughout.<br><br>It should be noted that, like most of Hammer's Frankenstein sequels,
this one chronicles the further adventures of Victor Frankenstein and
not the Frankenstein Monster. In that respect, they are quite unlike
the Universal sequels, where the Monster eventually ran out of things
to do and ended up being a virtual parody of himself. The original
Monster would, in fact, return in the next Hammer sequel, ""The Evil of
Frankenstein,"" and again a few years later in ""Horror of Frankenstein,""
which was a remake of ""Curse"" (this time with Ralph Bates as the Baron)
rather than a sequel. Both of these films, while enjoyable in their own
way (particularly for Hammerphiles), are inferior to this one and, in
my opinion, not as good as the other sequels (most notably
""Frankenstein Created Woman"") that do not feature the original
Frankenstein Monster.<br><br>Highly recommended.

Direct sequel to ""Curse of Frankenstein"" is just as good. Dr.
Frankenstein escapes the guillotine, changes his name to Dr. Stein,
moves to another town and begins his experiments again. Naturally
things go all wrong.<br><br>The story moves quickly and is very interesting, the color
cinematography is just simply superb, the set design is exquisite and
the acting is all good. Peter Cushing gives another great portrayal as
the Baron--it's a wonder this man never got the praise he deserved, he
was an excellent actor. Also Michael Gwynn gives a good performance as
a result of the doctor's experiments.<br><br>It's not really scary and there's no real monster, but the plot is so
interesting you don't really care! Well worth watching. A must see for
the color alone.

Baron Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) is sentenced to the
guillotine but he succeeds to escape facilitated by the hunchback Karl
Immelmann (Michael Gwynn) to Carlsbruck in Germany adopting the alias
Doctor Victor Stein. Three years later, he is a successful physician in
a poor hospital. Doctor Hans Kleve (Francis Matthews) recognizes
Frankenstein and blackmails him to be his assistant. Dr. Stein shows a
perfect body and tells to Dr. Kleve that Karl will donate his brain to
a healthy body. They successfully transplant Karl's brain to the new
body and Dr. Stein hides Karl in the attic. However a snoopy janitor
(George Woodbridge) witnesses the transportation to the room and tells
to the nurse Margaret Conrad (Eunice Gayson) that the doctors have
hidden a patient in the attic. Meanwhile Dr. Kleve comments with Karl
that he will become a medical sensation and Karl is afraid of the
situation. When Margaret finds Karl in the attic, he convinces her to
release the straps that hold him to the bed. Karl runs to Dr. Steins's
laboratory but he is attacked by a man that believes that he is a
burglar. When Dr. Stein and Dr. Kleve arrive in the laboratory, Karl
has already gone leaving two deaths on his path. What will happen to
Karl and to Dr. Frankenstein?<br><br>""The Revenge of Frankenstein"" is a good sequel of ""Frankenstein""
despite the title since there is no revenge. This is a good movie from
Hammer and that is not a surprise having director Terence Fisher and
Peter Cushing in the cast. Dr. Frankenstein giving explanations to Dr.
Kleve about his transplantation procedure is very funny. My vote is
seven.<br><br>Title (Brazil): Not Available

Peter Cushing is flawless and excellent as ever. The coordination of action

""The Revenge Of Frankenstein"" shows just how good, with the right
director, and cast, a horror film can be. Most horror film fans know
that Baron Frankenstein was a lot more interesting than his creation.
Hammer, wisely chose to follow the exploits and give more screen time
to Baron Frankenstein. Peter Cushing turns in a superb performance as
the Baron, Francis Matthews is quite capable as his assistant, Dr. Hans
Kleve, and Michael Gwynn is very good as ""Karl"" Dr. Frankensteins'
creation. This film picks up where ""The Curse Of Frankenstein"" ended.
Along with ""Horror Of Dracula"", ""The Brides Of Dracula"", ""Night
Creatures"", ""The Mummy"", And ""The Curse Of Frankenstein"", these are my
favorite Hammer Horror Films. Sit back and enjoy. John R. Tracy.

Revenge of Frankenstein is the only true sequel in the successful
Hammer series.  It is interesting to note,  that principal photography
began scant days after the completion of 'Horror of Dracula,'  and it
does not require a trained eye to see the re-dressed and painted 
Dracula sets  throughout the film.  Production Designer,  Bernard
Robinson,  and Director,  Terence Fisher both told me the paint on
some of the flats had yet to dry when shooting began.
Peter Cushing had the opportunity to refine and develop his portrayal
as the driven Baron Frankenstein.  His dialogue is caustic,  witty and
at times humorous.  This again was the Golden Age of  Hammer, 
that magic period that lasted but a short time.  The team of
Fisher,
Robinson,  Lighting Cameraman,  Jack Asher, and a completely
dedicated cast and crew shines as brightly as those newly painted
sets.  One of the best of the period,  and still plays well today.

OK so maybe not. Even though this movie is called ""The Revenge of
Frankenstein"" and the baron himself, who escaped the guillotine, also
tells that he is planning on taking revenge, he never does so in this
movie. Sloppy perhaps and also a missed opportunity. Nevertheless ""The
Revenge of Frankenstein"" remains one of the best put together and most
atmospheric Hammer movie. Esecially for late '50's standards, this
movie is a surprising good and effective one that more than serves its
purpose and has plenty enough to offer the viewer.<br><br>The story is well written and told, which is the main reason why this
movie works out great. It also helps to make this movie one of the
better ones out of the long line of Hammer Frankenstein movies. It's an
interesting movie to watch with a great perfect horror atmosphere, all
combined with the typical Hammer studio's style. The movie also
features some morbid humor which suits the style of the movie even
better and makes it an even more pleasant and entertaining one to
watch.<br><br>Unlike other Frankenstein movies this movie relies on original and self
developed and written elements. The Hammer studios throughout this way,
practically recreated the entire character of baron Frankenstein, with
its long line of Hammer Frankenstein movies. When I now think of baron
Frankenstein, I automatically think of Peter Cushing portraying him,
thanks to the Hammer movies.<br><br>The movie doesn't waste any time on things like character development,
which is also the reason why the movie is only 89 minutes short. It
makes the story flow well, without any drags or unnecessary moments but
one of the consequences also is that some of the characters don't quite
work out because of this, such as the Eunice Gayson character, who
doesn't seem to serve a purpose in the movie. The movie also doesn't
have enough emotional depth because of this. Even though the movie does
some attempts to give the movie some depth, mainly in its sequences
with the monster, the movie is too short and distant to really care
about any of it. But at least they did a worthy attempt, which makes
this movie an improvement over the first Hammer Frankenstein movie ""The
Curse of Frankenstein"".<br><br>Peter Cushing is really great as the baron who has taken the name Dr.
Stein, after escaping from the guillotine, to conceal his true
identity. Cushing really seem at ease with his role and he draws all of
the attention of the movie toward him. Unlike most other Frankenstein
movies the Hammer Frankenstein movies aren't really about the creature
but more about baron Frankenstein and his eternal morbid search for
cheating the death and creating life. It's a good thing that this movie
is about the baron and not really about the monster, for the actor who
plays the monster in this movie (Michael Gwynn) is exactly convincing
or a good enough actor. Further more the movie does feature some good
British actors for the smaller parts of the movie, who all seem to fit
their parts very well. <br><br>Through its atmosphere the movie does manages to create an overall
overly present creepy atmosphere which does provide the movie with some
good horror moments as well. Of course nothing too scary, since
obviously all Hammer movies are obviously more entertaining than scary
or serious. The movie also does feature some nice looking sets,
costumes and effects which help to set up the mood.<br><br>A must-see for the Hammer fans, mainly thanks to its well written and
told story.<br><br>8/10<br><br>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

His paternal grandparents were Austro-Hungarian Jewish immigrants, and his mother\'s family was Russian Jewish.Richard Dreyfuss worked his way up through bit parts (The Graduate (1967), for one) and TV before gaining attention with his portrayal of Baby Face Nelson in John Milius\' Dillinger (1973). He gained prominence as a college-bound young man in American Graffiti (1973) and as a nervy Jewish kid with high hopes in The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (1974). By the latter part of the 1970s Dreyfuss was established as a major star, playing leads (and alter-egos) for Steven Spielberg in two of the top-grossing films of the that decade: Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). He won a Best Actor Oscar in his first romantic lead as an out-of-work actor in The Goodbye Girl (1977). Dreyfuss also produced and starred in the entertaining private eye movie The Big Fix (1978). After a brief lull in the early 1980s, a well-publicized drug problem and a string of box-office disappointments (The Competition (1980), Whose Life Is It Anyway? (1981), The Buddy System (1984)), a clean and sober Dreyfuss re-established himself in the mid-\'80s as one of Hollywood\'s more engaging leads. He co-starred with Bette Midler and Nick Nolte in Paul Mazursky\'s popular Down and Out in Beverly Hills (1986). That same year he provided the narration and appeared in the opening and closing ""bookends"" of Rob Reiner\'s nostalgic Stand by Me (1986). He quickly followed that with Nuts (1987) opposite Barbra Streisand, Barry Levinson\'s Tin Men (1987) in a memorable teaming with Danny DeVito and Stakeout (1987) with Emilio Estevez. Dreyfuss continued working steadily through the end of the 1980s and into the 1990s, most notably in Mazursky\'s farce Moon Over Parador (1988), Spielberg\'s Always (1989), Postcards from the Edge (1990) and Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead (1990). He appeared as a member of an ensemble that included Holly Hunter, Gena Rowlands and Danny Aiello in the romantic comedy Once Around (1991) and as a pop psychiatrist, the author of several successful self-help books, who is driven to the edge by nutcase Bill Murray in the popular comedy What About Bob? (1991). Dreyfuss has also remained active in the theater (""Death and Maiden"", 1992) and on TV. He returned to features in the adaptation of Neil Simon\'s play Lost in Yonkers (1993) and followed with a supporting turn as the querulous political opponent in The American President (1995). Dreyfuss received some of the best notices of his career as a determined, inspiring music teacher coping with a deaf son and the demands of his career in Mr. Holland\'s Opus (1995).- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       A.

Younger brother of Lorin Dreyfuss.      Son of Geraldine Dreyfuss.      Formerly, at age 30, the youngest man to win Oscar for Best Actor (The Goodbye Girl (1977)). He was beaten by Adrien Brody (29) at the 2003 ceremony.      Was a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War.      Born in Brooklyn, New York, he grew up in Beverly Hills, California from an early age.      Has a great dislike for rock music.      Auditioned for the role as one of the Von Trapp children in The Sound of Music (1965), but cannot dance.      Treated for infection in right lung in a New York City hospital [April-May 2002].      Attributes much of his ability to end drug addiction to a life-altering vision experienced in hospital after a bad car crash. Under the influence of drugs while driving, Dreyfuss knew the crash was his fault. Though he was the only one injured, in his recovery state he was moved by the image of a beautiful little girl in a white dress. The girl served to remind him of the kind of innocent life he could have destroyed, and it compelled him to save his own life, he says, by confronting his drug demons.      Uncle of Justin Dreyfuss and Natalie Dreyfuss.      Claims to be a descendant of Alfred Dreyfus, who was wrongfully imprisoned at the notorious Devil\'s Island penal colony in French Guiana.      Attended the same High School as Angelina Jolie, Michael Klesic, Nicolas Cage, David Schwimmer, Lenny Kravitz, Corbin Bernsen and Gina Gershon.      Twice in his career he has left high profile musical productions due to his inabilty to cope with the physical demands of his roles. The first was in 1978 during pre-production of All That Jazz and most recently with the West End production of The Producers.      Had a serious drug problem in the late 1970s and early 1980s. One of the side effects was that his memory was damaged, so much so that he still has no memory of filming the movie, Whose Life Is It Anyway? (1981).      In 2004, he announced his retirement from film acting, and that he would concentrate on theater. He implied that he decided upon this course due to a lack of recent work in film and that his greater passion was always theater.      One of five actors to appear in films directed by both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg (the others are Harrison Ford, Liam Neeson, Christopher Lee, and Samuel L. Jackson). Richard Dreyfuss is the only one whose films were not part of the ""Star Wars"" or ""Indiana Jones"" series.      October 18, 2004: Dropped out of his role as Max Bialystock in ""The Producers"" in a London production. He cited a continuing problem following back surgery and a recurring shoulder injury. He was replaced by Nathan Lane.      Is a Civil War re-enactor.      In Stakeout (1987), his and Emilio Estevez\'s characters were quoting famous movie lines. Estevez said ""This was no boating accident!"" referring to Dreyfuss\'s character in Jaws (1975).      During 2004-2005, he took a short break from acting to lecture at Oxford University.      During his struggling actor years, he was constantly subjected to the ridicule of Hollywood casting directors after auditioning. The actor had written up a little list of their names which he kept as a reminder that he would eventually find success.      Was once played by Darrell Hammond in a skit on Saturday Night Live (1975). Hammond played Dreyfuss auditioning to play C-3PO in Star Wars (1977).      Was originally cast in the role of Joe Gideon in All That Jazz (1979), but left the production during the rehearsal stage.      Was married to Svetlana Erokhin in Harrisonburg, Virginia while in town for a speaking engagement at James Madison Univeristy.      Passed on two sequels from films he made in the early/mid-1970s: American Graffiti (1973) and Jaws (1975)... the sequels being More American Graffiti (1979) and Jaws 2 (1978), both of which came out in the late 1970s. In each sequel, his character is briefly mentioned as being away in a region with a cold climate... his American Graffiti character, ""Curt"", is in Canada and his Jaws character, ""Hooper"", is on an expedition in Alaska. In both sequels, most of the original cast has returned to reprise their roles. Also, each original film was directed by two groundbreaking filmmakers, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg (both making their mark in the industry); and both sequels were directed by another director.      Attended California State University, Northridge along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) co-star, Teri Garr.      In The Buddy System (1984), he played a truant officer who was a mentor to Wil Wheaton\'s character, in Wheaton\'s first film. Two years later, he played an adult version of Wheaton\'s character in Stand by Me (1986).      Lives in San Diego, California.      Has one son with Jeramie Rain: Ben Dreyfuss.      Because of memory loss problems, as a result of his drug addiction in the 1970s and 1980s, during the brief run of ""Complicit"" at the Old Vic in 2009, he controversially used an earpiece to enable the prompter to feed him his lines during performances. The play, co-starring Elizabeth McGovern and David Suchet, and directed by Kevin Spacey, was widely ridiculed in the British press as a result. Commenting on his many fluffed lines, the Daily Mail\'s theatre reviewer quipped, ""We\'re going to need a bigger earpiece."".      While filming Moon Over Parador (1988) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1987, he stayed at the world-famous Copacabana Palace Hotel.      His Oscar-winning performance in The Goodbye Girl (1977) was based on his good friend, Harlan Ellison.      Co-wrote a 1997 novel, ""The Two Georges"", with Hugo Award-winning science fiction writer, Harry Turtledove. The novel is an alternate history, based on the premise that the American Revolution was not successful, and America is still part of the British Empire.      Got his role as Roy Neary in Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) which was turned down by Al Pacino and Gene Hackman.      Became a father for the first time at age 36 when his now first ex-wife Jeramie Rain gave birth to their daughter Emily Dreyfuss in November 1983.      Became a father for the second time at age 38 when his now first ex-wife Jeramie Rain gave birth to their son Ben Dreyfuss in June 1986.      Became a father for the third time at age 42 when his now first ex-wife Jeramie Rain gave birth to their son Harry Dreyfuss in August 1990.      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on October 10, 1996.      Keynote speaker at the Dedication Day ceremonies at the Gettysburg National Cemetery on November 20, 2009.      His paternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Poland and Austria-Hungary, while his maternal grandparents were born in New York, both of them to Russian Jewish families.      As of 2014, has appeared in three films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: American Graffiti (1973), Jaws (1975) and The Goodbye Girl (1977).      He was awarded the 1996 Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for Distinguished Lead Performance for ""Three Hotels"" at the Mark Taper Forum Theatre in Los Angeles, California.Jane Fonda\'s role in The China Syndrome (1979) was originally written with Dreyfuss in mind. After he backed out of the project, due to salary concerns, the role was rewritten as female and was eventually played by Jane Fonda.      He was awarded the 1996 Drama Logue for Outstanding Performance for ""Three Hotels"" at the Mark Taper Forum Theatre in Los Angeles, California.      He was awarded the 1984 Drama Logue Award for Outstanding Performance for the play, ""The Hands of Its Enemy"", at the Mark Taper Forum Theatre in Los Angeles, California.      Got his role in Close Encounters of the Third Kind after it was turned down by Al Pacino and Gene Hackman.      His novel The Two Georges (1995), a steampunk detective thriller co written with Harry Turtledove, was allegedly optioned for a mini series by the UK\'s Granada Television in the late 1990s, but nothing ever came of this.      Best friends with Carrie Fisher.      Just recently formed a .org, called the Dreyfuss civics initiative. The organizations goal is to put civics classes back in the classroom, which is been absent from the curriculum of almost all schools in the United States since 1970. [2017]Personal Quotes (25)      [In 1976] People who commit adultery must die. Everyone knows that. Any movie tells you that!      I really think that living is the process of going from complete certainty to complete ignorance.      Happiness has a bum rap. People say it shouldn\'t be your goal in life. Oh, yes it should.      Actually, when I was a kid I was really more aware of the star and the handprints in Grauman\'s Chinese more than I was aware of anything else, including the Oscar. I wanted to have a star. I wanted to be able to see, you know, old gum on my star.      I don\'t think film acting is necessarily a triumph of technique. Film stardom is a friendship that happens between an audience and a performer. Its like you meet someone and you click with that person for whatever reason.      [on Bette Midler] I loved working with Bette. I rarely get to have a good leading lady and Bette and Marsha Mason are the best. I\'d work with them again anytime.      The motion picture business is run by corporate thieves.      I enjoyed the journey to the top but then found myself disappointed.      Behind all art is ego and I am an artist and I am unique.      [on Steven Spielberg] Steven Spielberg is the only person I\'ve come across who fits my criteria of genius. And I don\'t throw that word around. Genius is imagination and attention to detail. The ability to achieve to the minutest detail what you perceive in your imagination. I don\'t think there\'s another person on earth who\'s as great a plot structuralist or better storyteller.      [on James Stewart] You personify for me part of this nation. You symbolize an America that is gentle, ironic, self-deprecating, tough, and emotional.      [2009, on The Day Reagan Was Shot (2001)] I thought I was miscast. He\'s a character I could empathize with. He\'s totally human. A physically bigger person should have played him, but it was fun, and it was especially fun because it was true, and it was a really well-written script in that way. But playing him... You know, every actor wants to play the villain. The trick is not to wink at the audience and say, ""I\'m not him"".      [2009, on What About Bob? (1991)] Funny movie. Terribly unpleasant experience. We didn\'t get along, me and Bill Murray. But I\'ve got to give it to him: I don\'t like him, but he makes me laugh, even now. I\'m also jealous that he\'s a better golfer than I am.      [2009] Jaws (1975), first time I saw it, I forgot I was in it. True. Totally forgot, and got as scared as everybody else, and it\'s a great movie. I learned a shitload about my whole life, and I watched Steven [Steven Spielberg] go from being a boy to being a man. He was under so much pressure you couldn\'t believe. And his shark never worked, so they had to re-conceive as they went, and it was because of that mind-fuck that he made a great film.      I always knew that I could be a star for this whole audience that didn\'t relate to John Wayne or Al Pacino. An urban, progressive, intellectually-oriented audience, not too macho, people who read, people who listen to Paul Simon and Randy Newman. People like me.      [on The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (1974)] It was the first time I\'d ever seen myself in a feature film as a lead, and all I could remember was the bad moments that I didn\'t succeed at. I didn\'t really see the film and the performance as a whole until about ten years later.      It\'s really a mitzvah for the actor to know when you make people laugh, you are giving them a gift. You are, as Shakespeare said, giving surcease from sorrow. And that\'s an easy thing to fall in love with.      Acting is the only art form that is based entirely on pretense. The clothes you\'re wearing are not yours, the words you\'re saying are not yours, you pretend that you don\'t see the stagehand and you pretend you don\'t see the audience - and the audience pretends you\'re not actors, that you\'re real life. And that house of pretense creates art and truth. And it is an amazing feeling to make people laugh or make people cry.      I always knew I was going to be an actor and that was that - no doubts, no uncertainties, no changing my mind. And that was when I was like, nine, ten. And it never changed.      I\'d like to reinvent radio the way Orson Welles did. I\'d like to do Hamlet or I\'d like to do a master-class in Hamlet, or I\'d like to do something with history.      I much prefer the stage. Much. But I also prefer being paid. I like being paid as a screen actor but working on the stage.      When I saw Jaws (1975) for the first time, I forgot I was in it. It scared the crap out of me. That night, I heard something I\'d never heard before. They [the audience] went crazy, and then they silently watched the scroll and then they clapped again.      I wouldn\'t recommend to a young actor anymore to become an actor because I think the film industry has changed so terribly. The tools in the director\'s tool kit used to be story, dialogue, character... after that came cinematography and editing. Now it\'s special effects, editing and we [actors] are way down at the bottom part.      Film acting is about the hollowest experience you can have as an actor. When you do a film, it\'s out of order and sequence and everyone around you is working -- even directors now are behind the little video thing -- so you\'re alone. You\'re working for yourself.

He is the eldest son of actor Martin Sheen, who at the time was just breaking into the business. His mother, Janet Sheen (nÃ©e Templeton), was a former New York art student who had met Emilio\'s father right after he had moved to Manhattan. Martin and Janet had three other children, Charlie Sheen, RenÃ©e Estevez, and Ramon Estevez, all of whom became actors. His father is of half Spanish and half Irish descent, and his mother, whose family is from Kentucky, has English and Scottish ancestry.He lived on Manhattan\'s Upper West Side until his family relocated to Malibu in 1968. Before graduating from Santa Monica High School in 1980, Estevez had already had a small role as a messenger boy in Apocalypse Now (1979), that was ultimately cut from the film.Though his father had opted to use the stage name ""Sheen"" over his more ethnic birth name ""Estevez,"" Emilio chose to retain the family name, hoping to avoid riding his father\'s coattails. He also thought the double ""E"" set of initials was ""pretty.""He appeared in a few TV movies, the first of which was Seventeen Going on Nowhere (1980), before making his big-screen debut opposite Matt Dillon in 1982\'s Tex (1982). A part in The Outsiders (1983) followed, and Estevez made his first big splash as the punk rocker Otto in the cult classic Repo Man (1984).Originally cast as Bender (The Criminal) in the seminal John Hughes flick The Breakfast Club (1985), Estevez took the part of Andrew (The Athlete) instead after Hughes could find no one else to fill the role. Another ensemble film, St. Elmo\'s Fire (1985) came next. Then Estevez made his screen-writing debut with That Was Then... This Is Now (1985), a film in which he also starred.He then starred in the Stephen King thriller Maximum Overdrive (1986), but the film was a failure. The ambitious young actor added directing to his palette with Wisdom (1987) in 1986, but the film was universally panned and struck out at the box office. Estevez quickly rebounded with hits like Stakeout (1987) and Young Guns (1988), as well as their subsequent sequels. He tried his hand at directing again with Men at Work (1990) before taking on one of his most famous roles as Coach Gordon Bombay in The Mighty Ducks (1992). The enormously popular Disney film spawned sequels and an NHL hockey team of the same name, but Estevez was interested in making weighter films.He agreed to make a brief appearance in D3: The Mighty Ducks (1996) in exchange for Disney helping him finance and distribute another effort as actor-director, The War at Home (1996). Though smiled on by critics, The War at Home (1996) received a paltry distribution by Disney and thus went largely unseen. A devastated Estevez considered quitting the business but has ultimately continued to work in films, including a fourth effort as director and star, Rated X (2000), which co-starred brother Charlie Sheen and was a selection at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2006, Bobby (2006), a film about the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy that Estevez wrote, directed, and acted in, premiered at the Venice Film Festival and received a seven-minute standing ovation.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Azure_Girl          Spouse (1) Paula Abdul (29 April\xa01992            - 1994)\xa0(divorced)          Trade Mark (4)        Has a unique laugh, prominently featured in his role as Billy the Kid in the ""Young Guns"" franchise.        As a film director, he frequently casts members of his family in various roles. Prominent among these are his brother, Charlie Sheen, and his father, Martin Sheen.        As a film director, he often puts the most focus on the characters rather than the plot itself.        Frequently deals with social issues in his films (ex. returning soldiers in The War at Home (1996), the Civil Rights Movement in Bobby (2006), caring for the homeless in The Public).Trivia (22)      Was once engaged to Demi Moore.

Engaged to journalist Sonja Magdevski [September 5, 2006].      Almost went broke while writing the screenplay for Bobby (2006).      Because of writers block while writing the script for Bobby (2006), his brother Charlie Sheen suggested he change his surroundings. Estevez drove about 150 miles north of Los Angeles and randomly chose a motel to spend the night. While talking about his project with the woman working the front desk, she revealed she was actually in the ballroom the night Robert Kennedy was shot.      Both Emilio and brother Charlie Sheen have played the son of real father Martin Sheen; Emilio in both The War at Home (1996) and The Way (2010) (which Emilio also wrote and directed), and Charlie in Wall Street (1987) and two episodes of Spin City (1996).      Reportedly, as a child he did not get along with younger brother, Charlie Sheen, at all - in fact, they fought constantly.      Was originally set to play the lead in Oliver Stone\'s Platoon (1986), but when production shut down for two years, he moved on to other projects. The role then went to his brother Charlie Sheen. He was later cast in Stone\'s doomed project ""Jawbreaker"".      Makes wine in his own vineyard.

Additionally, Estevez guest-starred on Charlie Sheen\'s TV sitcom ""Two and a Half Men"" (2003).Personal Quotes (10)      What\'s the level of compromise for making that kind of money? How far do I have to sell my soul? What\'s the price of that? And I don\'t know if I want to make those kind of compromises any more. I think I\'m a different person. I think I\'ve matured to a great extent. I think that I want different things now. That it\'s not about the celebrity status that you receive because you\'re doing the next hot movie. It\'s about doing good work.      If Hollywood gives you a break and it gives you stardom, then it can take it away. If you earn it, it can\'t take it away.      I spent a lot of my life traveling and I knew that\'s where I got most of my education, not in school.      Writing is a lonely job, unless you\'re a drinker, in which case you always have a friend within reach.

I used to Google my name to see what came up - it hurt.      I swore to myself that I\'d make it through drive, ambition and hard work. I wanted to know I got it that way and not because of my bloodlines. And I think there is no question why I got where I am today. I\'m pretty content. I have a motto: expect nothing and be pleasantly surprised.      I grew up in a house where my mother was a strict Southern Baptist, and my father was a devout Catholic. I grew up as a kid hearing many arguments about religion. There was always a question about how we would be raised. We were baptized, and as often happens in these types of situations, the father loses the fight. Because of the turmoil, going to Mass was not part of our routine...

I think it was the only frigging television on the whole island. That was very bizarre"".      I\'m not a city kind of guy. I\'m happiest when I\'m tromping through the woods.

There was one moment in high school where I thought, ""Maybe I\'ll take an acting class."" And I walked in and saw all the quote unquote theatre people and I went, ""Oh God,"" and walked out. But later, when I was 19, I actually took an acting class and I was very much smitten with it.      ""Well, when I first got sent the script to The Assignment (1997), I thought, \'Why don\'t they offer this to Andy Garcia?\' And it turned out they did. I said, \'Oh, OK\'. I had a little bit of a question of \'How the hell am I gonna be believable?\' Or \'Will it be that much of a question in the audience\'s mind that I\'m supposed to be Venezuelan?\' So, we went with the brown contacts for Carlos and darkened my skin, worked with a good dialogue coach. And then when I heard Andy Garcia was playing an Irish cop in Sidney Lumet\'s movie [Night Falls on Manhattan (1996)], I stopped worrying about it. But that\'s one of the great things about being an actor. We get to play dress up. And that\'s what this movie was for me. Wigs, beards, mustaches, dialogues. Intrigue. It was a tremendous amount of hard work, but fun work for me"".      (On filming Songcatcher (2000) in North Carolina) It was fantastic. I would play my guitar on the porch every night after work. I\'d have a couple of glasses of wine, a cigar and sing a few songs. I loved it. I get a yearning in my bones for places I lived and worked, like Ireland, the Amazon jungle and now North Carolina. These places are imprinted on your psyche forever.      (1994 quote on why he believes he\'s not a bigger star) A lot of it is my fault, because it doesn\'t interest me. And I break the rules all the time: I should be doing this one, and instead I do The Playboys (1992). I don\'t care if one\'s going to be a commercial hit-this I don\'t like, and this I like. You do have to think career wise sometimes in this business, but I think I think enough about my career. I make a tremendous amount of money, and I\'m very well respected. I just don\'t get the consideration that big stars get as far as scripts go, or as far as input goes.      [on filming At Play in the Fields of the Lord (1991)] That was an unbelievably difficult and...challenging experience. I don\'t regret it. But I don\'t know if I\'d go back into it willingly again. It wasn\'t the jungle - I loved the jungle. We were three months over schedule, and it was a true Heart of Darkness experience in terms of what was happening on the set every day. And what was happening to the movie. And what was happening to the director. And what was happening to the relations between people.      (1994 quote) I would love, more than anything, to do an out-and-out farce with huge physical energy. Just because you\'re from the minimalist school, it doesn\'t mean you can\'t go big. I enjoy humor, and it\'s something I\'ve gotten very little chance to explore. I don\'t get offered those parts. And if I don\'t get offered a part, I don\'t get a part. Ever.      [on The Lemon Sisters (1989)] It\'s not a good movie. But it was a fun part. Carol Kane is a friend of mine and she kept begging me to do it. So, I basically did it as a favor to her.      (1994 quote in Movieline Magazine) My thing about looking good is that it should be the character. If I\'m playing a character who\'s concerned about his body-an athlete, say-I\'ll get in shape. If I\'m playing a character who doesn\'t or wouldn\'t, I don\'t. I almost never get in shape for a movie, even though I know it would be a good career move. I hate seeing movies where a poor fuckin\' sharecropper in the \'30s takes his shirt off and he\'s fuckin\' cut, with a washboard stomach and perfectly chiseled muscles that no farmer would ever have, that you can only get from intensive workouts with a trainer, isolating muscles.

I really enjoyed this movie!  It's filled with laughs and excitement, and
never once was I not entertained.  Next to ""48 Hours"" I think this is one of
the best buddy cop movies I have yet seen.  Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio
Estevez make a wonderful team, with dead-on chemistry.  Dreyfuss steals the
show with his hilarious performance, proving he's just as talented at doing
broad comedy as he is intense drama.  That especially shows in the scene
where he's about to walk out of Madeline Stowe's house, but doesn't want to
be recognized, so he asks her to lend him a hat.  The way he handled that
scene was so magnificent, and there are many other farcical moments that he
handled just as efficiently, and with the wrong timing and delivery those
scenes could've collapsed.  Estevez plays the straight man, also doing a
magnificent job, and you really feel his envy when he's spying on Stowe,
who's being hit on by Dreyfuss.  I loved the scenes where the rival cops
pulled pranks on each other.  Speaking of which, Forrest Whitaker pops up in
a fine early performance.  And Madeline Stowe is great and sexy, as always. 
  <br><br>Sure, the plot is quite predictable, but as I said I was always entertained,
thanks to sharp writing and great performances.  John Badham is a fine
action director, so he kept those action scenes filled with suspense and
tension.  ""Stakeout"" is not a film that will keep your brain occupied--as a
matter of fact there are some scenes that require you to check your brain at
the door--but I assure you that you'll have a damn good time.<br><br>My score:  8 (out of 10)

Somewheres in between 'Beverly Hills Cop' and 'Lethal Weapon' you find this.
Good cop/buddy action flick, plenty of humour, the violence is for real, the
chemistry between the two leads and Stowe Just right. I enjoy the scene
where she shifts her position JUST so slightly, its quite erotic, while  the
pranks the two cops play on each other are quite funny
too.<br><br>Its fun watching how put out Estevez gets with the older guy whose clearly
not acting his age.<br><br>There's nothing terribly deep here, and some of its really dated-Lethal

There is something about Richard Dreyfuss that makes me think of George
Clooney.  I believe Clooney is one of a very few slate of actors that can
make any scene work no matter how good or bad it is written.  Dreyfuss is
like that too.  I remember a particular scene in Jaws when he brings wine
over to Brody's house and Brody cracks it open and decides to drink from
it.
Dreyfuss tries to warn him by saying, ""  You might want to let that
breathe....  nothing, nothing. "" He takes a small scene and makes it that
much more interesting by his excellent interpretations of who they are.
Chris Leece is his best acting since the seventies.  He is so much fun to
watch and it is his relationship with Bill ( Estevez ) and the other two
stakeout cops ( one of them being a very funny Forest Whitaker ) that make
this film a treat to watch.  Its strengths are its dialogue and acting,
and
although Badham directs a fast and frenzied film ( much like Beverly Hills
Cop ) some of the movie just doesn't fit, especially the end where it
resorts to Bruce Willis tactics and ends with explosions and death.  But
that aside the film excels, and it is a very funny film written by the
same
guy that had a hand in The Fugitive.<br><br>Here we have a film about two cops ( Dreyfuss and Estevez ) that are
assigned to watch the home of the girlfriend of an escaped convict that
may
be on his way back to see her.  Dreyfuss ends up getting a little too
close
to his subject and before long he ends up falling in love with her.  This
puts Bill in an awkward situation because not only is it against the rules
and ethics, but he has to now cover for Chris during briefings with his
superiors and he also has to keep the other two cops on the stakeout from
finding out about Chris' involvement with their subject.  The subject's
name
is Maria and she is played with richness by Madeline Stowe ( The General's
Daughter ).<br><br>Some of the hilarity in this film lies with the two sets of cops trying to
out do one another in their pranks.  It seems that they have worked on
stakeouts together before and it is shenanigans like leaving dog poop in
the
fridge and putting marker on the rims of the binoculars that add some nice
comedy to the routine.  Dreyfuss also has one hilarious line that had me
laughing for quite some time.  When they first get their description of
who
it is that they are watching, it describes Maria as 5'5 and 342 pounds.  ""
342 pounds!  OHHH, she could be the house! ""<br><br>The film works great as a comedy and only so so as a violent action film.
I
think the film would have benefitted if it stuck strictly to comedy and
instead of reverting to a chase and explosions at the end, they could have
written it better so that it is resolved with words and comic genius, just
like the rest of the film.  But overall this film is worth seeing for its
hilarity.<br><br>**** One final note.  Chris and Bill have movie line contests.  It is a
great way to pass the time and when Bill asks Chris the one line "" Well
this
was not a boating accident. "" Chris doesn't know.  That is a nice touch
seeing as it was Dreyfuss' Matt Hooper from Jaws that said that.  That's a
nice piece of inside Hollywood and it plays really well.

This is a forumulaic buddy movie, but it works.  Madeleine Stowe is just
wonderful.  Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez also work very well.  With
good supporting acting all around, this movie works, when normally I would
be rolling my eyes.<br><br>Good acting and some very good one-liner writing make what could have been
a
bad movie (like ""Another Stakeout"") and enjoyable experience. I recommend
it
for some good-hearted fun.

Some people knock this film but I think it is a very good film.<br><br>The basic plot line is Richard Dreyfuss (Chris Lecce) and Emilio
Estevez (Bill Reimers) are detectives who are assigned to stakeout a
woman (Madeline Stowe). Her ex-boyfriend is a violent con who has
escaped from prison (Aidan Quinn) and the F.B.I think there may be a
chance that he will try to get in contact with her. Chris Lecce soon
finds himself falling in love with Maria and gets in many funny
situations as he comes a part of the stakeout himself such as him
leaving her house the next morning after they have made love and
disguising himself with a pink hat and shawl and trying to evade the
police without being recognised and ending up being on the surveillance
and on tape.<br><br>I think the number one thing that works for the film is the
relationship between Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez's characters.
They have great chemistry and just bounce humour off one another.
Another humorous aspect to their relationship is a type of role
reversal. Chris is older than Bill but yet he is not that bothered
about promotion and he doesn't commit to any of his girlfriends. While
Bill is a happily married man who has a child and who wants to go up
the promotion ranks.<br><br>Another thing that makes me laugh is the competition Bill and Chris
have with Dan Lauria (Phil Coldshank) and Forest Whitaker (Jack Pismo)
where they play practical jokes on one another. I especially liked the
one Bill played on Phil's dog where he put a wild cat in the car and
the cat ended up chasing Phil's dog down the road. Brilliant! The film
even had time to add romance to the story between Maria and Chris which
added another dimension to the film and it was interesting seeing their
relationship develop and what would happen in the end when Maria found
out Chris was a cop.<br><br>This film has the right mix of genres in it and it doesn't slow down
the plot line but it gives you different emotions to feel, humour,
romance and your heart rate jumping which it did, in the scene where
you think Aidan's character has come and he kills Chris and Maria. I
jumped out of my seat at that. I liked that John Badham added that as
at that point you have taken in the humour and romance and then this
scene comes along that surprises and shocks you.<br><br>One of my best Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez films.

Good stuff from the 80's. A cop buddy movie, with a little romance, a
little action and a lot of comedy. The comedy part works out pretty
well. The soundtrack is, well, very 80's.. but very good also. Serious
scenes depicting the bad guys are pretty realistic and the movie has
surprisingly dark tones in these parts. Only thing I don't like about
in this movie, is that Richard Dreyfuss was 40 when he made this, gray
hair and not that much of it, he doesn't have the looks of Connery, and
he gets this hot young girl. Of course he is nice and funny and all
that, but I found it to be a bit of a far stretch. Also the main
characters have both a funny mustache which makes Dreyfuss look even
older.

This is a great Action/Comedy that's quite hilarious and very
entertaining with a cool story, Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez are
brilliant together!. All the characters are great, and it also had some
good dramatic moments as well, plus Richard Dreyfuss,Emilio Estevez and
Madeleine Stowe are all simply amazing in this!. Aidan Quinn is very
good as the bad guy, and I thought Estevez and Dreyfuss had wonderful
chemistry together ,plus it's very well made and written as well. It's
also pretty underrated in my opinion, and one of the funniest scenes in
the movie for me is when the cops are chasing Dreyfuss as they think
he's the suspect, and he's wearing a pink hat and weird clothing, plus
this should be higher then 6.4!. The whole cast really seemed to be
enjoying themselves, and Dreyfuss and Stowe had pretty good chemistry
together as well, plus the finale is quite exciting. The ending is very
funny, and it had some great music in it as well, plus the opening was
somewhat disturbing. This is a great Action/Comedy that's quite
hilarious and very entertaining, with a cool story, Richard Dreyfuss
and Emilio Estevez were brilliant together, I highly recommend this
one!. The Direction is great!. John Badham does a great! job here with
really good camera work, good angles and keeping the film funny and at
a very fast pace. The Acting is wonderful!. Richard Dreyfuss is amazing
here, he is extremely hilarious very likable had wonderful chemistry
with Estevez, had some cool lines, seemed to be enjoying himself, and
had perfect comic timing!, I love this guy!. Emilio Estevez is amazing
as always and is also amazing here, he is extremely likable, funny
worked so well together with Dreyfuss had lots of charisma, and had
some really funny scenes, he was amazing! (Estevez rules!!!!!!!).
Madeleine Stowe is incredibly gorgeous and is amazing as always, she
had a decent accent, was funny had pretty good chemistry with Dreyfuss,
and had a fun character I loved her as usual! (Stowe Rules!!!!!!!).
Aidan Quinn is very good as the bad guy, he was intense and really
convinced me I liked him. Dan Lauria and Forest Whitaker are good as
the two dim witted cops I liked them. Rest of the cast are fine.
Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5

For a film which reached number 1 at the US box office and earned
enough movie for the studio to green-light a sequel, Stakeout has
strangely enough become a forgotten 80s gem.<br><br>The story is simple, officers Lecce (Richard Dreyfuss) and and Reimers
(Emilio Estevez) are assigned to a stakeout of the house of waitress
Maguire (Madeleine Stowe), hoping that her fugitive ex-boyfriend (Aidan
Quinn) will return to her house. Things soon take a bizarre twist, as
Lecce, posing as a telephone repairman, and Maguire start to fall in
love.<br><br>Although the film offers no originality and is riddled with clichÃ©s, it
is very entertaining. Although it runs for nearly two hours, it
thankfully doesn't feel that long and the story keeps you interested
all the way. Richard Dreyfus and Emilio Estevez are quality comedians,
somewhat surprisingly in my opinion. Their jokes and banter make the
comedy part of this film work well.<br><br>The thriller elements are good too, Aidan Quinn does a good job making
his character look like a real bad-ass, and the film's action sequences
are really solid pre-cgi-stuff. I was especially impressed by the car
chase, which looks really good.<br><br>Overall, this is pure solid 80s entertainment and I think this film
deserves to be remembered and watched. I think it is equally good as
many other 80s action classics like ""48 hours"" for example.
Recommended!

This is kind of funny and, for the most part, enjoyable. On the surface
it looks like another comic cop thriller but, really, the core of the
plot couldn't be older. That is -- it goes way past ""The Gay DivorcÃ©e,""
past the Greek or Roman from whom Shakespeare stole ""A Comedy of
Errors,"" back past the masques, winding up somewhere I would guess
around Homo cromagnonsesis in Les Ezyies de Tayac. The
mistaken-identity plot is framed by a bit of violence. First, Dreyfus
gets into a fist fight with a perp he and Estevez are chasing (Estevez
is nothing much more than a straight man in this movie) and the two
combatants fall into a huge container of fish and barely escape being
filleted by the Chinese workers. The second involves a shoot out
between Aidan Quinn's villain and a lot of cop cars and owes a lot to
the chase in ""Bullitt"", although done mostly for laughs. At the end
there is another strictly conventional shootout and fist fight, aboard
a boat, on top of rolling logs (this is Seattle), and in a timber mill
which gives us a good idea of how gigantic saws are used to turn logs
into planks -- and men into planks as well, given half a chance. <br><br>Quinn is excellent, but so is almost everyone else. Madeleine Stowe is
drop-dead gorgeous, with or without Hispanic makeup, and she can act
too. Dreyfus is very funny. He is caught in all sorts of embarrassing
situations and gets a chance to display that expression of abject
humiliation that he does so well. He gets a chance to do a lot of
physical comedy too, running around wearing a pink sun hat, wrapped in
a shawl, while pursued by the police. And when he inadvertently reveals
he is spying on Stowe, during a phone call in which he warns her that
her food is burning, she demands to know how he knew. He tears his eyes
from the telescope and tells her, ""I -- er -- I could hear is sizzling
in the background."" Then he turns his face to the side, wrinkled with
disgust, and hisses to himself -- ""Heard it SIZZLING in the
background?"" There are all sorts of run-ins in which she still thinks
he is the phone repairman he's been pretending to be, and they're all
engagingly cute.<br><br>It's not a masterpiece of comedy, and the realistic violence is out of
place. But it's smoothly, professionally done. There is an icky them
song, but the composer gives Stowe's scenes a bouncy
fingido-sabor-Latino sound. I've seen this a couple of times and keep
waiting to be bored by it but have never quite been able to get over
the hump.

The IMDb rating of 6.5 for ""Stakeout"" is about right. It's a good
comic-crime film with some well-done action scenes. It becomes much
more serious toward the end when bad guy Aidan Quinn becomes a real
threat.<br><br>I've always thought of Richard Dreyfuss as a comic actor, something
like Jack Lemmon, but of course with his own style. He's excellent at
amusing us even when his lines are not outright comical but depend on
the situation. He's good at irony. Dreyfuss makes this film. Emilio
Estevez is along for the ride. Madeleine Stowe does a nice job as a
lonely Hispanic woman. Her character also has the comic attribute of
wanting to get a nice man as husband. Aidan Quinn provides the needed
balance of threat and danger.<br><br>It's an enjoyable outing with a nicely-balanced script. There is one
car chase that has some spectacular wrecks and rollovers in it.

I really enjoyed this movie!  It's filled with laughs and excitement, and
never once was I not entertained.  Next to ""48 Hours"" I think this is one of
the best buddy cop movies I have yet seen.  Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio
Estevez make a wonderful team, with dead-on chemistry.  Dreyfuss steals the
show with his hilarious performance, proving he's just as talented at doing
broad comedy as he is intense drama.  That especially shows in the scene
where he's about to walk out of Madeline Stowe's house, but doesn't want to
be recognized, so he asks her to lend him a hat.  The way he handled that
scene was so magnificent, and there are many other farcical moments that he
handled just as efficiently, and with the wrong timing and delivery those
scenes could've collapsed.  Estevez plays the straight man, also doing a
magnificent job, and you really feel his envy when he's spying on Stowe,
who's being hit on by Dreyfuss.  I loved the scenes where the rival cops
pulled pranks on each other.  Speaking of which, Forrest Whitaker pops up in
a fine early performance.  And Madeline Stowe is great and sexy, as always. 
  <br><br>Sure, the plot is quite predictable, but as I said I was always entertained,
thanks to sharp writing and great performances.  John Badham is a fine
action director, so he kept those action scenes filled with suspense and
tension.  ""Stakeout"" is not a film that will keep your brain occupied--as a
matter of fact there are some scenes that require you to check your brain at
the door--but I assure you that you'll have a damn good time.<br><br>My score:  8 (out of 10)

Somewheres in between 'Beverly Hills Cop' and 'Lethal Weapon' you find this.
Good cop/buddy action flick, plenty of humour, the violence is for real, the
chemistry between the two leads and Stowe Just right. I enjoy the scene
where she shifts her position JUST so slightly, its quite erotic, while  the
pranks the two cops play on each other are quite funny
too.<br><br>Its fun watching how put out Estevez gets with the older guy whose clearly
not acting his age.<br><br>There's nothing terribly deep here, and some of its really dated-Lethal
Weapon-ish graphics, the cars, the angry black squad leader, the music(Miami
Sound Machine, anyone?), etc, traditional boatchase/fight/battle to the
death inside hellacious warehouse/factory finale, etc all par for the
course.<br><br>But no biggies. The second one wasn't nearly as good's this
one.<br><br>*** outta ****

There is something about Richard Dreyfuss that makes me think of George
Clooney.  I believe Clooney is one of a very few slate of actors that can
make any scene work no matter how good or bad it is written.  Dreyfuss is
like that too.  I remember a particular scene in Jaws when he brings wine
over to Brody's house and Brody cracks it open and decides to drink from
it.
Dreyfuss tries to warn him by saying, ""  You might want to let that
breathe....  nothing, nothing. "" He takes a small scene and makes it that
much more interesting by his excellent interpretations of who they are.
Chris Leece is his best acting since the seventies.  He is so much fun to
watch and it is his relationship with Bill ( Estevez ) and the other two
stakeout cops ( one of them being a very funny Forest Whitaker ) that make
this film a treat to watch.  Its strengths are its dialogue and acting,
and
although Badham directs a fast and frenzied film ( much like Beverly Hills
Cop ) some of the movie just doesn't fit, especially the end where it
resorts to Bruce Willis tactics and ends with explosions and death.  But
that aside the film excels, and it is a very funny film written by the
same
guy that had a hand in The Fugitive.<br><br>Here we have a film about two cops ( Dreyfuss and Estevez ) that are
assigned to watch the home of the girlfriend of an escaped convict that
may
be on his way back to see her.  Dreyfuss ends up getting a little too
close
to his subject and before long he ends up falling in love with her.  This
puts Bill in an awkward situation because not only is it against the rules
and ethics, but he has to now cover for Chris during briefings with his
superiors and he also has to keep the other two cops on the stakeout from
finding out about Chris' involvement with their subject.  The subject's
name
is Maria and she is played with richness by Madeline Stowe ( The General's
Daughter ).<br><br>Some of the hilarity in this film lies with the two sets of cops trying to
out do one another in their pranks.  It seems that they have worked on
stakeouts together before and it is shenanigans like leaving dog poop in
the
fridge and putting marker on the rims of the binoculars that add some nice
comedy to the routine.  Dreyfuss also has one hilarious line that had me
laughing for quite some time.  When they first get their description of
who
it is that they are watching, it describes Maria as 5'5 and 342 pounds.  ""
342 pounds!  OHHH, she could be the house! ""<br><br>The film works great as a comedy and only so so as a violent action film.
I

instead of reverting to a chase and explosions at the end, they could have
written it better so that it is resolved with words and comic genius, just
like the rest of the film.  But overall this film is worth seeing for its
hilarity.<br><br>**** One final note.  Chris and Bill have movie line contests.  It is a
great way to pass the time and when Bill asks Chris the one line "" Well
this
was not a boating accident. "" Chris doesn't know.  That is a nice touch

He had a twin brother who was stillborn. In September 1948, Elvis and his parents moved to Memphis, Tennessee where he attended Humes High School. In 1953, he attended the senior prom with the current girl he was courting, Regis Wilson. After graduating from high school in Memphis, Elvis took odd jobs working as a movie theater usher and a truck driver for Crown Electric Company. He began singing locally as ""The Hillbilly Cat"", then signed with a local recording company, and then with RCA in 1955.Elvis did much to establish early rock and roll music. He began his career as a performer of rockabilly, an up-tempo fusion of country music and rhythm and blues, with a strong backbeat. His novel versions of existing songs, mixing \'black\' and \'white\' sounds, made him popular - and controversial - as did his uninhibited stage and television performances. He recorded songs in the rock and roll genre, with tracks like ""Jailhouse Rock"" and ""Hound Dog"" later embodying the style. Presley had a versatile voice and had unusually wide success encompassing other genres, including gospel, blues, ballads and pop music. Teenage girls became hysterical over his blatantly sexual gyrations, particularly the one that got him nicknamed ""Elvis the Pelvis"" (television cameras were not permitted to film below his waist).In 1956, following his six television appearances on The Dorsey Brothers\' ""Stage Show"", Elvis was cast in his first acting role, in a supporting part in Love Me Tender (1956), the first of 33 movies he starred in.In 1958, Elvis was drafted into the military, and relocated to Bad Nauheim, Germany. There he met and fell in love with 14-year old army damsel Priscilla Ann Wagner (Priscilla Presley), whom he would eventually marry after an eight-year courtship, and with whom he had his only child, Lisa Marie Presley. Elvis\' military service and the ""British Invasion"" of the 1960s reduced his concerts, though not his movie/recording income.Through the 1960s, Elvis settled in Hollywood, where he starred in the majority of his thirty-three movies, mainly musicals, acting alongside some of the most well known actors in Hollywood. Critics panned most of his films, but they did very well at the box office, earning upwards of $150 million total. His last fiction film, Change of Habit (1969), deals with several social issues; romance within the clergy, an autistic child, almost unheard of in 1969, rape, and mob violence. It has recently received critical acclaim.Elvis made a comeback in the 1970s with live concert appearances starting in early 1970 in Las Vegas with over 57 sold-out shows. He toured throughout the United States, appearing on-stage in over 500 live appearances, many of them sold out shows. His marriage ended in divorce, and the stress of constantly traveling as well as his increasing weight gain and dependence upon stimulants and depressants took their toll.Elvis Presley died at age 42 on August 16, 1977 at his mansion in Graceland, near Memphis, shocking his fans worldwide. At the time of his death, he had sold more than 600 million singles and albums. Since his death, Graceland has become a shrine for millions of followers worldwide. Elvis impersonators and purported sightings have become stock subjects for humorists. To date, Elvis Presley is the only performer to have been inducted into three separate music \'Halls of Fame\'. Throughout his career, he set records for concert attendance, television ratings and recordings sales, and remains one of the best-selling and most influential artists in the history of popular music.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Ed Stephan and Chris Holland          Spouse (1) Priscilla Presley (1 May\xa01967            - 9 October\xa01973)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)          Trade Mark (10)        The famous left-sided grin        His movements, with his pelvis, that gave him the nickname, ""Elvis, the pelvis"", which he strongly disliked        Longer and slightly deeper sideburns        White sequined jumpsuits with rhinestones        Onstage karate moves        Peanut butter and banana sandwiches (with bacon)        Two trademark phrases were ""Thank ya!"" and ""Thank ya\' very much!""

His twin brother, Jesse Garon Presley, died at birth. Elvis was successfully delivered, approximately 35 minutes later.      Earned a black belt in karate in 1960.      Won three Grammy Awards, all for his gospel music.      His hair color was blonde until his early teens. As he got older his hair became darker. By the time he had his hair cut for the army at age 22 its natural color was dark chestnut (according to Charlie Hodge, who served with him in the army).      Was originally considered for the Kris Kristofferson role in A Star Is Born (1976), but Elvis turned it down because his manager, Tom Parker, refused him permission to act in a movie where he wouldn\'t have top billing. Also, he didn\'t like the fact that the producer, Jon Peters, was completely unknown.      Owned a pet chimpanzee called ""Scatter"".      Has more multi-platinum album sales than any other performer, with 12 albums selling over two million copies.      Father of Lisa Marie Presley (birthdate, Thursday, February 1st, 1968).      Interred at Graceland Estate, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.      His autopsy detected ten different drugs in his bloodstream.      Is a direct descendant of Abraham Lincoln\'s great-great grandfather, Isaiah Harrison.      Had 18 Billboard #1 songs, the first being ""Heartbreak Hotel"" in March of 1956. His 18th and final #1, ""Suspicious Minds"", was released in September 1969.      When The Beatles came to America in 1965 there was only one person they wanted to meet: Elvis. On Friday, August 27, 1965, they got their wish and, according to John Lennon, spent an entirely enjoyable evening at the Presley home in Bel Air, California, talking, singing and laughing with each other.      He bought Graceland mansion on Tuesday, March 19, 1957, from Mrs. Ruth Brown Moore for $102,500. The mansion, built of tan Tennessee limestone, consists of 23 rooms and 13.7 surrounding acres. The Music Gates were installed in April of 1957. The name ""Graceland"" came with the mansion, from the days when it was originally used as a church.      His television debut was on the regionally telecast Louisiana Hayride (1955), Saturday, March 5th, 1955 in Shreveport, Louisiana.      In September 1955, ""Country Song Roundup"" magazine was the first to feature an article on Elvis, calling him a ""folk music fireball"".      In April of 1955 Elvis auditioned for a spot on Arthur Godfrey\'s Talent Scouts (1948) and was turned down.      Elvis\' body was placed in a family crypt in Memphis on Thursday, August 18, 1977. Eleven days later, however, an attempt was made to steal his body but the plan failed and three men were charged with trespassing and released on bond. Because of this incident, Vernon Presley, received approval from the Memphis Adjustment Board to allow re-interment of the bodies of Elvis and his mother, Gladys Presley to the Meditation Garden behind Graceland, which took place, on Sunday, October 2, 1977.      The book he was reading at the time of his death was ""The Scientific Search for the Face of Jesus"" by Frank O. Adams, (Psychical Aid Foundation, USA, 1972).      From the time they met up until his death, Elvis always sent a roomful of flowers to Ann-Margret whenever she opened up a show in Las Vegas.      Was one of the performers featured on a set of stamps of rock and blues legends issued by the U.S. Postal Service in June 1993.      His mother, Gladys Presley, gave him his first guitar in 1947, when he was 12 years old, as a birthday present.      He was a 1953 graduate of Humes High School, in Memphis, Tennessee.      Was one of the first people in the U.S. to own a ""Betamax"" system VCR      Honorary Member of Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity.      After seeing him in concert, Liberace suggested adding flashy costumes to his act. Elvis took the advice, and became famous for his gold lame jackets and jeweled white jumpsuits. He later reserved a seat for Liberace at a majority of his concerts, as his way of saying thanks.      One of only a handful of artists inducted into both The Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame and The Country Music Hall of Fame. Others include Johnny Cash and Hank Williams.      Died with about $5 million in his bank account.      Elvis did not like confrontation. He wanted to fire his manager, Tom Parker, many times. He would tell his friends ""Tell Parker, he\'s fired."" His friends would go tell him, then Parker would say ""Tell Elvis to tell me personally"". Elvis never did.      ""Heartbreak Hotel"", which spent 17 weeks at #1 on Billboard\'s country chart (and 10 weeks on Billboard\'s Hot 100) was the #1 country song of 1956.      Inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1998.      His 1977 country hit, ""Way Down,"" was the #1 song on Billboard magazine\'s country singles chart the week of Elvis\' death. Nine other songs would go to #1 on Billboard\'s country charts between 1956 and 1981: ""I Forgot to Remember to Forget,"" ""Heartbreak Hotel,"" ""I Want You, I Need You, I Love You,"" and the two-sided #1 hit ""Hound Dog/Don\'t Be Cruel"" (all 1956); ""All Shook Up,"" ""(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear"" and ""Jailhouse Rock"" (all 1957); ""Moody Blue"" (1977); and ""Guitar Man"" (1981, a remixed version released more than three years after his death). Most of his 1950s #1 country hits were also #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 as well.      In Sam Lovullo\'s book ""Life in the Kornfield"", which recalled his years as producer of 1969\'s country music TV series Hee Haw (1969), he remarked that Elvis was a big fan of the show and had always wanted to perform on it. However, according to Lovullo, Elvis remarked they\'d have to tape his spots in the middle of the night, knowing that if manager Tom Parker had found out, he\'d never clear his appearance. Several months after Elvis\' death, his father, Vernon Presley, appeared on ""Hee Haw"" and spoke about how the world would always love him and remember his music.      Hysteria over ""Elvis sightings"" after his death were lampooned in the Mojo Nixon song ""Elvis Is Everywhere"" and ""Elvis Is Dead"" by Living Colour.      His personal entourage were known as the ""Memphis Mafia"", and were given matching rings by Elvis. The diamond and gold rings sported a thunderbolt and the letters ""TCB"" (reportedly standing for ""Take Care of Business""). Elvis was buried wearing one of the rings.      Pictured on a 29Â¢ US commemorative postage stamp issued on Friday, January 8th, 1993, 58 years after his birthdate. This was the inaugural issue in the Legends of American Music series.      In 2002 a re-mixed version of one his more obscure recordings, ""A Little Less Conversation"", became a dance club hit, and topped the charts in the United Kingdom.      The lightest Elvis ever weighed, as an adult, was 170 pounds in 1960, following his discharge from the U.S. Army. The heaviest was at the time of his death, which was 260 pounds. He gained 90 pounds in his final 17 years of life.      Was always known to be generous to a fault with family, friends and even total strangers. Anyone who admired any posession of his, from one of his many Cadillacs to any bit of bric-a-brac in his home, often found themselves the new owners of that posession.      Inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame (sponsored by the Gospel Music Association) in 2001.      Made the first ever musical video of all time: Jailhouse Rock (1957).      When Ed Sullivan finally allowed him to appear on Toast of the Town (1948), he was filmed from the waist upwards only once, on his third and final appearance on Sunday, January 6th, 1957.      His 1960 single ""It\'s Now Or Never"" is one of the best selling singles of all time--if not the all-time best selling single--with sales estimated to have been between 25 and 30 million copies.      He is responsible for the best selling single of the 1950s (""Hound Dog/Don\'t Be Cruel"", 1956) and that of the 1960s (""It\'s Now Or Never"", 1960).      His 29Â¢ commemorative postage stamp issued in 1993, sold more copies than any other postage stamp in U.S. Postal Service history.      A remix of his song ""A Little Less Conversation"" was featured on the soundtrack to the film Ocean\'s Eleven (2001) and became a Billboard #1 hit single, over 20 years after his death.The Beatles were admirers of his work and, although John Lennon said they enjoyed his company very much, Elvis himself, ironically, thought that they were a bad influence on America\'s youth.      Elvis was descended from a woman named Morning White Dove (she was his maternal great-great-great-grandmother two times over). Morning White Dove is believed by some to have been a Cherokee Native American, although it is not clear if documentary evidence exists that she was a Native American. Elvis\' character in G.I. Blues (1960) has a Cherokee background.      He was allegedly offered roles in The Rainmaker (1956), The Defiant Ones (1958), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), West Side Story (1961), Sweet Bird of Youth (1962), The Fastest Guitar Alive (1967), Midnight Cowboy (1969), True Grit (1969), Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971), A Star Is Born (1976) and Grease (1978).      He said that his favorite of all his films was King Creole (1958). He also said his film that he disliked the most was Clambake (1967).      During his third and final appearance on Ed Sullivan\'s Toast of the Town (1948) weekly program, on Sunday, January 6, 1957, he angered Sullivan by singing the gospel song ""Peace In The Valley"" on his show, after Sullivan asked him not to.      He was a distant cousin of former US President Jimmy Carter (1977-81). When Elvis died on Tuesday, August 16, 1977, Carter said the next day, ""Elvis Presley\'s death deprived our country of a part of itself. He was unique and irreplaceable"".      He was temporarily a Shelby County (Tennessee) deputy sheriff.Hal B. Wallis, producer of eight of his films, wanted to make a western with Elvis and John Wayne, but it never came about.      In 1973 he met with Led Zeppelin members Robert Plant and John Paul Jones in Los Angeles. An idol to the members of Led Zeppelin, Elvis wanted to meet ""who was outselling him"" at concerts (Zeppelin was in the midst of a record-breaking tour that year). A meeting was arranged with Plant and Jones. Plant was so awestruck at meeting his idol in person that he could barely speak to him. Jones, nearly as awestruck as Plant, made small talk with the ""King,"" and mentioned what a beautiful watch Elvis wore. Elvis, always the generous one, instantly traded his $5,000 gold and diamond watch for Jones\' $10 Mickey Mouse watch. This broke the ice with all of them, and they became fast friends. Throughout the early 1970s members of Led Zeppelin even attended a few of Elvis\' concerts, and were granted the privilege of sitting in the front row by the King himself.      He named his four personal favorite films as: Rebel Without a Cause (1955), A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), Dirty Harry (1971) and Bullitt (1968).      He was drafted into the US Army in 1958, stationed in West Germany and discharged in 1960, achieving the rank of sergeant. His being in the army was a public relations headache, according to army documents released by the Pentagon on Thursday, June 9, 2005. ""Elvis Presley will not be released in a manner different from any other inductee serving overseas,"" the Army\'s adjutant general wrote to citizens who complained following reports that the rock icon would get an early ""good behavior"" discharge. When he entered the army at Memphis, Tennessee, on March 24, 1958, there was a public outcry from his fans, and protests flowed to Washington, including a hand-written plea released by the National Archives and Records Administration. ""Dear Mamie,"" one correspondent wrote to then First Lady Mamie Eisenhower. ""Will you please, please be so sweet and kind as to ask Ike [President Dwight D. Eisenhower] to please bring Elvis Presley back to us from the Army? We need him in our entertainment world to make us all laugh."" A 1959 Army memo set out the Presley problem: ""When Private First Class Presley was first inducted, there was considerable adverse public reaction . . . alleging that he would receive preferential treatment in the Army. This impression has been largely replaced by a public impression of a good soldier serving his military obligation . . . Many teenagers who look up to and emulate Private First Class Presley will . . . follow his example in the performance of their military service"".      On Monday, December 21, 1970, he paid a visit to President Richard Nixon at the White House in Washington, D.C. The meeting was initiated by Presley, who wrote Nixon a six-page letter requesting a visit with the President and suggesting that he be made a ""Federal Agent-at-Large"" in the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.      More people watched Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii (1973) (live via satellite TV broadcast)--the first of its kind--than watched astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin as they landed and then walked on the moon on July 20, 1969. Interestingly, the US audience didn\'t view this concert event live. It was seen by much of the world on January 14, 1973. The US audience had to wait almost three months, as it was telecast for the first time in the US on April 14, 1973. Several songs recorded by Elvis in a studio while he was in Hawaii were added. The concert was preceded, on NBC, by an Ann-Margret special.      He only performed two concerts outside of the United States of America. Both of them were in Canada. Therefore, all of his concerts were in North America.      Son of Vernon Presley and Gladys Presley.      Recorded 33 takes of ""Hound Dog"".      His favorite sports were racquetball and football.      He temporarily passed out from exhaustion, after recording ""If I Can Dream"".      After production of his 1968 NBC television special he told producer Steve Binder he would never make another movie or song he didn\'t believe in.      Once sent $1,000,000 to Buford Pusser, the crimefighting Tennessee sheriff who was the subject of the 1973 film Walking Tall (1973).      Once gave a robe to Muhammad Ali. On the back of the robe was stitched ""The Peoples Champion"", which was Presley\'s nickname for Ali.      His favorite actors were Marlon Brando and James Dean. In a 1956 interview he said that he considered Dean an acting genius.      His two favorite books were ""The Holy Bible"" and ""The Impersonal Life"".      His favorite class in high school was wood shop.      His mansion, Graceland, is the second most-visited place in United States of America. The first is the White House.Elia Kazan had expressed interest several times in casting Elvis in his films, Elvis\' manager Tom Parker refused to allow it.      Last film he saw in a theater was The Spy Who Loved Me (1977).      He tried to get a print of Star Wars (1977) to show his daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, his last full day of life, on Monday, August 15th, 1977.      He is referenced in the work of other music artists. He is mentioned in the songs ""That Don\'t Impress Me Much"" by Shania Twain, ""Without Me"" by Eminem (as well as spoofed in the music video) and ""Three Minute Boy"" by Marillion.      He was on the school boxing team while attending Humes High School in Memphis, TN.      Loved football and often had three TVs set up at Graceland to watch all of the games in progress at the same time.      He used to play touch football at Whitehaven High School during the \'60s and early \'70s with kids around the neighborhood.      Helped to support an All-Negro Day at the Memphis Zoo in 1956.      In 1975 he purchased a poor black East Memphis woman an electric wheelchair and picked her up and personally sat her in it. The woman\'s teenage daughter told Elvis she liked his car. He gave it to her and even gave her boyfriend a job.      He was a fervent admirer of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King and had hoped to meet him in 1966, but the meeting never occurred. Many observers believed that was because his manager, Tom Parker, didn\'t want to alienate Elvis\' fans in the South, many of whom saw King as an ""outside agitator"" because of his civil-rights work among Southern blacks.      Was a huge fan of the television shows The Jeffersons (1975), Good Times (1974), Happy Days (1974) and Flip (1970).      Once an opera singer attended one of his 1950s concerts and met him backstage. The singer told Elvis that he sang like a hillbilly and needed singing lessons. Elvis replied, ""Thanks for the advice, but how many of the thousands of people out there tonight came to hear you sing?"".      One set of genealogical research states that his surname was Anglicized from the German ""Pressler"" during the Civil War, and that his ancestor was Johann Valentin Pressler, who emigrated to North America in 1710. Pressler first settled in New York but later moved to the South. Jaime Pressly is also descended from him. Elvis also had English, Scottish, distant French, Dutch, Danish and--possible but unverified--Native American ancestry (through his descent from Morning White Dove, who was Elvis\' great-great-great-grandmother twice over).      Shown on a 5.50 kr postage stamp issued by Sweden in 2004.      He was the #1 touring act in America for 1977; the year he died. This, despite the fact that he was well below par and only toured until July, is quite an achievement.      Held the world indoor attendance record for a concert. At the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit on December 31, 1975, 62,500 fans attended. The show also set a record for the biggest box-office take for a single show: $850,000.      Held a single day\'s attendance record for his March 1974 shows at the Houston Astrodome--89,000 fans for two shows.      According to a show on the A&E; Biography channel, he once attended a concert for singer Connie Francis and had to leave for emotional reasons once he heard her sing the old Italian song ""Mama"", as his mother, Gladys Presley had recently died.      Lived with Linda Thompson for 4-1/2 years, from 1972-6. She was a former ""Miss Tennessee,"" actress and songwriter. Other than Priscilla Presley, Thompson was the most significant romantic relationship Elvis ever had.      When he was an infant a tornado struck his hometown of Tupelo, Mississippi. He and his family survived uninjured, but 233 people in the city were killed and hundreds were injured.      Suffered from chronic insomnia.      His tombstone gives his name as ""Elvis Aaron Presley"", whereas he was in fact named ""Elvis Aron Presley"". Although this fueled conspiracy theories that he had faked his death, it is generally believed he changed his middle name so it would be the same as Biblical person, Aaron, (brother of Moses).      Had glaucoma in the 1970s.      At the time of his death in 1977, he was the second best-selling recording artist of all time, second only to longtime successful crooner, Bing Crosby.      He was a born-again Christian who loved to sing gospel music.      None of his 33 films, 31 features and two musical documentaries were ever nominated for an Academy Award. Of his 31 feature films only one, Wild in the Country (1961), lost money.      He had two full face-lifts and rhinoplasty during the mid-1970s. On one of these visits to hospital he was accompanied by Linda Thompson.      He worked with legendary guitar player Hank Garland from 1957-61.      Was director Robert Wise\'s original choice to play Tony in West Side Story (1961).      He was portrayed by Jason Alan Smith in Crazy (2008).      Nephew of Vester Presley.      Most of the films he starred in were not critically acclaimed, although he received good reviews for Flaming Star (1960) and King Creole (1958).      In the month following his final concert, at Indianapolis, Indiana, on Sunday, June 26, 1977, he was reported to have gained an extra 50 pounds.      Is portrayed by Val Kilmer in True Romance (1993). Like Presley, Kilmer is also said to have possible Cherokee heritage.      Of his many numerous impersonators, his personal favorite was Andy Kaufman.      Prior to being signed by RCA in November 1955, Elvis was known as ""The Hillbilly Cat"" in his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee.      Is portrayed by Michael St. Gerard in Great Balls of Fire! (1989)      His song ""Heartbreak Hotel"" is based on a note left by a man who committed suicide in a Florida hotel suite. When Elvis first performed the song on Stage Show (1954) in 1956, he sang the words ""They\'re so lonely they pray to die"". This was changed in later performances from ""pray to die"" to ""they could die"" so as not to offend the religious establishment with a reference for a prayer for death.      Elvis topped the Forbes Magazine list of deceased highest earners for the fourth consecutive year, with earnings of $45 million in 2004.      In 1977 alone his personal physician, Dr. George Nichopoulos (usually referred to as ""Dr. Nick""), had prescribed at least 10,000 hits of amphetamines, barbiturates, narcotics, tranquilizers, sleeping pills, laxatives and hormones for Presley. His medical license was later revoked for prescribing such huge amounts of drugs.Barbra Streisand originally wanted Elvis to play the role of John Norman Howard in A Star Is Born (1976), but the studio couldn\'t meet Tom Parker\'s demands ($1 million plus equal billing with Streisand).      Elvis dreamed of playing Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather (1972), but when he asked to audition for the part he was turned down.      One of his biggest hit songs, ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"", was written in 1926 by Lou Handman and Roy Turk and first recorded by Lou\'s sister Edith Handman with Lou at the piano. Vaughn Deleath and The Colonial Club Orchestra released a version of the song in 1927 that became a hit. \'The Carter Family\' recorded a bluegrass version with additional verses in 1936. The first charted version was by Blue Barron in 1950 (#16 US Pop), which introduced the spoken portion, modeled after Jacques\' ""All The World\'s A Stage"" speech in William Shakespeare\'s ""As You Like It"". Al Jolson recorded that version several weeks later. Additionaly, it was singer Jaye P. Morgan\'s 1959 (#65 US Pop) version of the song, as well as Blue Barron\'s earlier 1950 version, that Elvis heard while in Germany that influenced him to record the song shortly after his discharge from the army. Elvis\' 1960 version of ""Are You Lonesome Tonight"" is closest to the 1950 Blue Barron recording.      He was an avid collector of guns and badges.      In 1981, Kirsty MacColl had a number 14 single in the UK with the song ""There\'s a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop Swears He\'s Elvis"". He also inspired the song ""Elvis Ate America"" on the album ""Original Soundtracks 1"" by Passengers, which was a U2 and Brian Eno side project in 1995.      Once claimed Robert Mitchum was the inspiration for his famous hairstyle. Presley met Mitchum to discuss the possibility of starring together in Thunder Road (1958), but unfortunately Tom Parker\'s demands for Presley\'s salary could not be met.      He was portrayed by Peter Dobson in Forrest Gump (1994).      Along with Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins, Elvis was a member of the celebrated ""Million Dollar Quartet"", so named because they were money-makers for Sam Phillips\' Sun Records label.      Newspaper reports indicated that Sammy Davis Jr., Farrah Fawcett, Burt Reynolds and John Wayne were supposed to attend Presley\'s funeral, but they did not turn up. Ann-Margret, James Brown and George Hamilton were the only celebrities in attendance.      He was seriously considered for the role of the Texas Ranger in True Grit (1969) starring John Wayne. Unfortunately, Tom Parker\'s demand that Presley receive top billing could not be met, so the part went to Glen Campbell instead.      He was offered a role in the animation film, Gay Purr-ee (1962), but disliked the roles of off-screen voice acting.      His autopsy detected 14 different drugs in his bloodstream, ten in significant quantity.      His home Graceland in Memphis is the second most popular private tourist attraction in the United States after the White House, and is estimated to bring in $150 million to the city itself each year.      Named the highest earning deceased celebrity for the sixth consecutive year in 2006 by Forbes.com.      He was considered for Ricky Nelson\'s role in Rio Bravo (1959) starring John Wayne and Dean Martin. However, by the time filming began in May 1958 Presley was stationed with the US army in Germany.      He is credited as a co-writer of ""(I\'ll) You\'ll Be Gone"" (1965). This was the B side of the hit from his film Girl Happy (1965), ""Do The Clam"". It is found in his five-CD box set of \'60s recordings. Elvis composed the lyrics and brought the song to a recording session.      In 1973 he was the biggest taxpayer in the US.      It was estimated that he earned earned $4.5 billion in his lifetime.      With a lot of entertainers making a living mimicking Elvis, Jimmy Buffett wrote a song called ""Elvis Imitators"" making mention of a few of Elvis\' films, song titles, and mannerisms.      Has sold 1.8 billion records worldwide, more than any other artist or music group.      He was discovered by Sun Records owner Sam Phillips.      On Thursday, November 11th, 2004, he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame for his outstanding contribution to British music and integral part of British music culture.      His parents Vernon Presley and Gladys Presley were unemployed during the Great Depression of the 1930s and lived on welfare and then on Social Security after it was created during the administration of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt.      In 1970 he wrote to J. Edgar Hoover requesting to join the FBI at the height of its campaign against political protests in the United States.      Met President Lyndon Johnson at the White House in 1965.      Has been portrayed by Val Kilmer, Harvey Keitel, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Kurt Russell, Don Johnson, Bruce Campbell, David Keith, Rob Youngblood, Peter Dobson and Scott Bakula.      The very last song he sang in public was ""Can\'t Help Falling In Love"", at The Market Square Arena in Indianapolis, Indiana, on Sunday, June 26, 1977.      He did an early \'60s concert in Hawaii, and donated the proceeds to help build the USS Arizona memorial.      Turned down the leading role in The Fastest Guitar Alive (1967), which went to his friend Roy Orbison.      In 2007 the National Rifle Association (NRA) released an Elvis Presley Tribute Revolver, officially authorized by his estate.      After his concert in Hawaii in 1961, Presley concentrated on making movies and did not perform before a live audience again for seven years until his 1968 TV special and subsequent return to Las Vegas in 1969.      He was ranked #2 on VH1\'s 100 Sexiest Artists and #8 on VH1\'s 100 Greatest Artists of Rock & Roll. He was voted best singer of all time by Q Magazine. He was voted the 3rd Greatest Rock \'n\' Roll Artist of all time by Rolling Stone magazine.      As a young man, Elvis idolized a gospel group called The Statesmen. According to Elvis\' backup singer and lifelong friend Joe Moscheo, Elvis\' leg-twitching dance moves were inspired by The Statesmen\'s bass singer, ""Big Chief"" Wetherington, who was famous for his leg twitching.      Between 1957-69 he performed only two concerts and made just two television appearances.      In 1962 he ceased almost completely to record non-soundtrack songs until his 1969 album ""From Elvis in Memphis"".      In July of 2005, Presley was named one of the top 100 ""Greatest Americans,"" following a vote organized by Discovery Channel. In the vote, Presley ranked ahead of all entertainers and in 8th place behind Presidents Ronald Reagan, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, plus Martin Luther King and Benjamin Franklin.      His records have spent a total of 79 weeks at the #1 position on the US charts.      His records have spent 2,574 weeks in both the UK singles and album charts, were and still are way ahead of his closest competitors Cliff Richard (1,982), Queen (1,755), The Beatles (1,749) and Madonna (1,660).      He was planning his first ever European tour in 1978.      In Alexandria, Louisiana, early in 1977 a local journalist complained that the singer was on stage for less than an hour and ""was impossible to understand."" In Baton Rouge, Presley didn\'t go on stage at all. He was unable to get out of his hotel bed and the rest of the tour was canceled.      Investor CKX paid $100 million for an 85% interest in Presley\'s income in February 2005.Robbie Williams dedicated his song ""Advertising Space"" to him.      He is credited as a co-writer of ""(I\'ll) You\'ll Be Gone"" (1965). This was the B side of the hit from his film Girl Happy (1965), ""Do The Clam"". It is found in his five-CD box set of \'60s recordings. Elvis composed the lyrics and brought the song to a recording session. He is also listed in the writer\'s credits to ""Heartbreak Hotel"".      His favorite actors were James Dean, John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and Marlon Brando. Brando personally strongly disliked Presley.      He was mentioned in Walter Kirn\'s novel, ""Thumbsucker"".      Was a fan of actors Peter Sellers and Tony Curtis.      On seeing Elvis in rehearsal for Stage Show (1954) Jackie Gleason--the show\'s producer--described Elvis as ""Marlon Brando with a guitar"".      Was the first entertainer to introduce karate in an American motion picture (Flaming Star (1960)).      While he never joined any political party, his political views were somewhat mixed. During the early 1960s he was an outspoken admirer of liberal President John F. Kennedy. He later confessed to ""weeping openly"" at the news of Kennedy\'s death. Later in life, however, he made a more conservative move on the political spectrum. He began singing the praises of President Richard Nixon, and his right-wing streak culminated in a visit to the White House in December 1970. During the visit, Presley was photographed giving the President a handgun, which was (for security reasons) presented but not given. Presley spoke of his admiration for Nixon, revealed his disgust at the hippie counterculture, spoke disparagingly of The Beatles (he said that having earned their money in America, they had then left for England to promote ""anti-American"" feelings), fervently expressed his patriotism, offered to infiltrate and go undercover in left-wing hippie groups, asked to be appointed a federal narcotics agent, and even hugged the president twice. Nixon, for his part, was not sure if Presley was serious or not, but granted his request and made him an honorary federal agent. Nixon said he was equally parts bewildered and amused by the encounter, thanked Presley for his support, and the picture of the duo has become one of the most famous photos taken in the White House. On Presley\'s death in 1977, the former president asked Americans to lower their flags all over the country as a mark of respect.      Elvis was a good friend of Johnny Cash, going back to their Sun Records\' days recordings, after being discovered by Sam Phillips.      Voted the third greatest singer of the rock era in a Rolling Stone magazine poll in 2008.      Elvis\' original combo (Elvis, Scotty Moore and Bill Black) were nicknamed and known as ""The Blue Moon Boys featuring that Hillbilly Cat"" after their popular rendition of Bill Monroe\'s ""Blue Moon Of Kentucky"". Moore acted as Elvis\' first manager. Black in the late \'40s was a member of Gene Krupa\'s band and later had a successful recording career with Bill Black\'s Combo.      The last song he sang was ""Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain"", at home, and playing the piano, to family and friends, Monday evening, August 15th, 1977.      According to Elvis and his manager Tom Parker, Elvis\' return to TV in 1968 was in part due to NBC (Universal Pictures) agreeing to finance the remaining movies he was scheduled to make.      In 1953 while working as an usher in a local Memphis movie theater he sang, by request, ""That\'s Amore"" on stage.      He unsuccessfully auditioned for CBS\' Talent Scouts (1948) nine months before his successful debut on Stage Show (1954). The trip to New York City for the audition was not a complete loss for Elvis. That same day he went uptown to see Bo Diddley, who was appearing at The Apollo.      In 1955 he appeared in a rock documentary, The Pied Piper of Cleveland: A Day in the Life of a Famous Disc Jockey (1955), about Cleveland DJ Bill Randle, filmed in various locations in the Cleveland, Ohio, area (mainly Brooklyn High School). The film headlined many top acts of the day including Bill Haley and the Comets, Pat Boone, The Four Lads and others. This film has yet to be released. It is still reportedly the property of Polygram International and in the Universal vault.      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6777 Hollywood Boulevard for Recording in Hollywood, California.      His funeral procession on August 18, 1977, consisted of 49 cars led by 11 white Cadillacs--Cadillac was his favorite car.      His live performance of ""My Way"" done early in his 1977 tour and featured on his October 1977 TV special was a million-selling single following his death.      Many Elvis fans and historians agree that his 1969 recording sessions at American International Studios in Memphis were among his greatest work--it contained songs in a variety of musical genres, from pop to country/western to R&B; to standards, in addition to new material.      Four grandchildren: Riley Keough (b. May 29, 1989), Benjamin Keough (b. October 21, 1992) and twin girls Harper Vivienne Ann & Finley Aaron Love Lockwood (b. October 7, 2008).      During his 21-year association with RCA Records (1956-77), the only year he failed to have a single in the Billboard Top Pop 20 was 1967.      He is not related to Reg Presley (b: Reginald Maurice Ball), the lead singer of the popular British rock band The Troggs, which had 2 million sellers of their own, ""Wild Thing"" (1966) and ""Love Is All Around"" (1968).      Owned a collection of Andy Kaufman tapes.      During the 1970s he had 28 singles reach the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Posthumously, he had a #1 single on the Hot 100 in 2002 with the remix of ""A Little Less Conversation"".      Both his father Vernon Presley and grandmother Minnie Mae outlived him. Vernon died in 1979 at age 63 and Minnie Mae died in 1980 at age 90.      Former wife Priscilla Presley opened up their home Graceland to the public on June 7, 1982. Elvis\' Aunt Delta remained living on the estate until her death in 1993.      Bought former US President Franklin D. Roosevelt\'s yacht ""Potomac"" for $55,000 in January 1964.      According to Tommy Steele, Presley did visit London once in 1958. However, this has not been substantiated.      He asked his father Vernon Presley to pick TV evangelist Rex Humbard to officiate at his funeral.      His death on August 16, 1977, was 29 years after baseball athlete and first home-run king, Babe Ruth\'s death, August 16, 1948 and 21 years after actor, Bela Lugosi, August 16, 1956.      Reports of the last words spoken by Elvis vary. He ended his last press conference with the words: ""I hope I haven\'t bored you."" Other reports say his last words were: ""Okay, I won\'t"" (The last words spoken to Ginger Alden, his girlfriend at the time of his death, who told him on the way to the bathroom not to ""fall asleep in there."").      Elvis owned one of the world\'s first mobile phones. He had to have one after seeing Sean Connery use a car phone in the James Bond movie From Russia with Love (1963). Elvis\'s phone was contained in a suitcase-size carrying case with his name in black letters on a gold label on the front. He would use it to talk from his limousine.      Was a huge fan of professional wrestling.      His last film, Change of Habit (1969), had him as a doctor in an urban clinic, reflecting his attempt to be ""relevant"" to the social activism of the youth of the \'60s. Additionally, this film dealt with what was then considered to be medical treatment of an ""autistic"" child, a topic almost unheard of in 1969.      After not having a Top 20 hit single since 1966, Elvis\' Nov. 68 ""comeback"" TV Special spawned the now standard ""If I Can Dream"", (#13 US Pop). This was followed in 1969 by ""Memories"" (#35 US Pop), which was also performed on the Special, ""In The Ghetto"" (#3 US Pop), ""Suspicious Minds"" (#1 US Pop), and ""Don\'t Cry Daddy"" (#6 US Pop).      On his first appearance on Stage Show (1954) on Jan. 28, 1956, he sang a medley of ""Shake Rattle and Roll"" / ""Flip Flop and Fly"" and later performed ""I Got A Woman"". That breakthrough performance of ""I Got A Woman"", to a startled 1956 audience, had not been seen for years, but as of 2010 it is available on YouTube.      He and Andy Griffith debuted together, but at different times, on Steve Allen\'s weekly program The Steve Allen Show (1956), on July 1, 1956. It was Steve Allen\'s second show and Elvis\' appearance skyrocketed it in popularity.      While Elvis appeared on NBC\'s The Steve Allen Show (1956), on Sunday, July 1, 1956. his manager Colonel Tom Parker was contacted by Ed Sullivan about Elvis appearing on Sullivan\'s weekly CBS variety show, Toast of the Town (1948), on CBS. Elvis was signed for a then staggering $50,000 for three appearances. This was quite an accomplishment--or lack of foresight--as Sullivan and Allen were broadcast in the same Sunday-evening time slot and had an ongoing ""ratings war"" against each other. Even more amazing was that Elvis\' prestigious record label, RCA Victor, was a subsidiary of the corporation that owned NBC. The NBC logo at that time was the famous RCA Color (TV) Peacock. Elvis already had sold at least five million records for RCA. Allen would later state that his reason for ""giving away"" Elvis was that he ran strictly a comedy show. Ironically. the following summer Allen hosted Jerry Lee Lewis twice. After this, Sullivan was not as interested in biding for Lewis as he was for Elvis. Lewis did not appear on Sullivan\'s show until 1969.      An earlier take of Elvis\' 1956 hit ""I Want You, I Need You,I Love You"" is titled ""I Need You, I Want You, I Love You"". This earlier version of the song appeared on some copies of his debut album titled ""Elvis"" and was later issued in a 1977 compilation package..      The media coverage of his death overshadowed that of the 86-year-old comedian and film star Groucho Marx, which occurred three days later.      In the mid-\'70s he was approached to help finance a karate movie called ""New Gladiators"" in which he would narrate and make a cameo appearance at the climax. The film was never completed in his lifetime.      Stage: ""All Shook Up"", a show based on his work, debuted on Broadway in 2004.      During the days following Elvis\' death, Philadelphia Phillies\' pitcher Tug McGraw (father of Tim McGraw), with guitar in hand, played a medley of Elvis\' songs on the team bus.      In the 1981 documentary This Is Elvis (1981), in previously unseen footage, Elvis sang ""Always On My Mind"", a #16 hit from 1972 written for him by Mark James. Just months later, in 1981, Willie Nelson covered the song and it became a Grammy winner and one of Nelson\'s all-time signature hits. As the song was not written specifically for the film, it could not qualify for an Academy Award nomination. The Academy Award-winning song for 1981 was ""The Theme from ""Arthur"".      Reportedly, in 1969 he received a death threat, just prior to his opening in Las Vegas. Though he had FBI agents providing security for him, for added protection he carried a Derringer pistol on stage, in his shoe.      During rehearsal for his June 5, 1956, appearance on Texaco Star Theatre Starring Milton Berle (1948), Berle reportedly said to Elvis. ""Let\'s see what you can do without the guitar"". What resulted was a captivating extended televised performance by Elvis of the not yet recorded ""Hound Dog""; enjoyable to his fans, though shocking to others including the news media, it was a song that he had been performing, up to that point, with guitar in hand. By the time of his second appearance on Toast of the Town (1948), later in 1956, Elvis sang without his guitar, with The Jordanaires as his back-up vocal group and his back-up combo. For the most part this format would be followed for all of Elvis\' stage performances for the remainder of his career. In 1969, when he returned to Las Vegas, a full orchestra was added.      It was after his appearance on Texaco Star Theatre Starring Milton Berle: Episode #8.13 (1956) that Presley inadvertently earned the nickname ""Elvis the Pelvis"". While performing his classic ""Hound Dog"", Presley switched tempo in the middle of the song and began gyrating his hips suggestively. The performance caused such a furor that Berle received a reported 30,000 letters decrying his decision to allow such ""lewd behavior"" on national television. During the show Presley was backed by Scotty Moore (guitar), Bill Black (bass) and D.J. Fontana (drums).      Prior to marrying Priscilla Presley, Elvis proposed marriage to legendary cult actress Tura Satana, who turned him down. It is believed that Priscilla copied her hairstyle after that.      One set of genealogical research states that Elvis\' surname leads back to Irish ancestors, who hailed from the village of Hacketstown in County Carlow. William Presley was forced to leave Ireland for America after a local dispute over land. He later moved to Carolina, where he had a son called Dunnan, and then moved on to Tennessee. Dunnan\'s granddaughter Rosella was born in 1863 and, though she never married, she had several children including one called Jessie. He named his son Vernon Elvis, and Vernon Presley later named his son Elvis Aaron Presley, the man who went on to become The King.      Curiously, cut from the 2009 issue of his critically acclaimed film King Creole (1958) was his performance of ""Hard Headed Woman"" a #1 hit for Elvis at the time of the film\'s release. A rare occurrence, possibly, the only time in film history that an essential musical number has been cut from a film, over a half-century after the film\'s release. Added in its place in 2009 is the then previously unseen stripper\'s sequence with the song ""Banana"". In 1958 the ""Banana"" scene, complete with female stripper, with its obvious phallic reference, would have been ""too much"" for the censors and mainstream America.      Of Terry Stafford\'s 1964 cover of Elvis\' recording of ""Suspicion"", a back-up group was added to sing the word ""suspicion"". This addition proved successful for Stafford, though many listeners still think they are listening to Elvis. Stafford\'s version of the song received considerable airplay and rose to #3 on the US pop charts.      Many rock singers mimicked Elvis\' singing style, early in their careers, before adopting their own style for which they are most remembered. The most successful, in that area, was Conway Twitty with his (1958-61) hit recordings of ""It\'s Only Make Believe"", ""The Story Of My Love"" and ""Lonely Blue Boy"", originally recorded by Elvis as ""Danny"" for King Creole (1958) but later cut from the film. Twitty later crossed over to the country field. Charlie Rich\'s initial hit, ""Lonely Weekend"" (1960), followed the same pattern, long before he was known as country music\'s ""Silver Fox"". One of Johnny Rivers\' first recordings, ""You\'re The One"" (1958), and a 1956 recording of ""That\'ll Be The Day"" by Buddy Holly--not the 1957 million selling version that is most played--sounded like Elvis behind the mike. There were also ""one-hit wonders"" like Ral Donner, the narrative voice of Elvis in This Is Elvis (1981), who had a million seller with ""You Don\'t Know What You Got Until You Lose It"" (1961). Of course, there\'s Terry Stafford\'s successful 1964 cover of Elvis\' recording of ""Suspicion"".      During the rehearsal for his 1968 TV Special Elvis (1968), he reportedly gave an impromptu performance of ""MacArthur Park,, a big hit of the day for Richard Harris. Unfortunately, that performance was not recorded.      ""I\'ll Be Home For Christmas"", was the original closing number for Elvis\' special, Elvis (1968). On previous occasions he headlined Christmas specials that were aired on radio stations throughout the Southern US. Producer Steve Binder and Elvis decided that a song that reflected the turbulence of the 1960s, and at the same time gave a plea for hope and understanding, would be more appropriate than a Christmas ballad to end the show. Earl Brown, the show\'s Musical Director, was asked by Binder to go home and write such a song. He did just that and composed, on short notice, ""If I Can Dream"", with its reference to Martin Luther King\'s 1963 ""I Have A Dream"" speech, given in Washington, DC. Brown\'s newly composed song contained the lyrics, ""If I can dream of a better land, where all my brothers walk hand in hand"". With minimal rehearsing and no demo to work with, Elvis\' spontaneous live performance of the new closing song was released as his next million-selling single, peaking at #13 on the US pop charts. The success of ""If I Can Dream"" led the way for Elvis to record other songs with social issues, such as ""In the Ghetto"", ""Clean Up Your Own Backyard"" and ""Don\'t Cry Daddy"".      His 1st big performance was at the Oventon Park Shell in Memphis in 1954.      He was discharged from the army on March 24, 1960. Eight days later, on April 1, he began filming G.I. Blues (1960).      His 1972 live album recorded at Madison Square Garden featured many celebrities in the audience, including George Harrison, Art Garfunkel, David Bowie, all the members of Ten Years After and Led Zeppelin, Paul Simon and Bob Dylan. It was reported that John Lennon was secretly in the audience, but Lennon insisted in a 1975 interview that he had never seen Elvis live. Bruce Springsteen was in the audience, having signed with Columbia Records about a month prior. The album was also the inspiration for a young Eddie Murphy, who would play it loud and lip-sync to it in front of the mirror. Murphy has gone on to say that it was Elvis who inspired him to become an entertainer.      Although Bob Dylan enormously admired him, Elvis was disparaging of Dylan, especially in terms of his singing voice. Once he was said to privately quip, ""My mouth\'s so dry, feels like Bob Dylan slept in it"". Later, however, he recorded a cover of Dylan\'s song, ""Tomorrow is a Long Time"". Elvis reportedly disliked much of the 1960s popular music, including The Beatles, because he associated it with the ""drug culture"", although he did freely cover songs by many such bands.      In early March of 1960, Elvis was on his way back to America from military duty in Germany. The plane Elvis was boarding on made a brief stop in the town of Prestwick, Scotland, where he was greeted and embraced by hundreds of British fans. This would be his first and only visit in the United Kingdom.      Was one of the many dozen of celebrities like John Agar, John Russell and Sabu who visited renowned animal trainer and Hollywood animal behaviorist Ralph Helfer\'s Africa U.S.A. Exotic Animal Ranch in Soledad Canyon, California on weekends to play with the animals and pitch in with the chores. Elvis\' favorite animal was a chimp named Coffee, who once belonged to Mae West.      Pictured on a USA \'forever\' commemorative postage stamp in the Music Icons series, issued 12 August 2015. Price on day of issue was 49Â¢.      Childhood friend of Wink Martindale.      Had a twin brother, Jesse Caron, who died in infancy.      His all-time favorite horror movie was Black Christmas (1974). He made it a tradition to watch the film every Christmas and to this day his family honors his memory by watching the film every Christmas.      Received his first ever screen kiss from co-star Jana Lund in Loving You (1957).      Former son-in-law of Ann Beaulieu and stepson-in-law of Paul Beaulieu.      Former brother-in-law of Michelle Beaulieu Hovey.      He was widely known to be a very private man.      ""The All American Boy"" is a 1958 \'talking blues\' song written by Bobby Bare, but credited by Fraternity Records to Bill Parsons, with songwriting credit to Bill Parsons and Orville Lunsford. The song reached #2 on the Billboard charts and was inspired by the success and then conscription of Elvis Presley.      Double first cousin of Patsy Presley Geranen.      Though Elvis is famed for the ""I don\'t sound like nobody"". He did have idols, and one of these, was dubbed \'the greatest entertainer of them all\' it seems a fitting tribute to think that the King was in awe of Al Jolson.      When he wanted to emulate Ricky Nelson\'s hairstyle, his hairdresser Carrie White talked him out of it: ""Elvis please, let\'s don\'t mess with success."" He gifted her with a derringer.Personal Quotes (36)      [asked who he sounded like] I don\'t sound like nobody.      [asked what kind of music he sings] I sing all kinds.      I don\'t like being called Elvis The Pelvis. That\'s gotta be one of the most childish expressions I\'ve ever heard coming from an adult.      Some people tap their feet, some people snap their fingers, and some people sway back and forth. I just sorta do \'em all together, I guess.      [his acceptance speech from the 1970 Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Nation Awards] When I was a child, ladies and gentlemen, I was a dreamer. I read comic books, and I was the hero of the comic book. I saw movies, and I was the hero in the movie. So every dream I ever dreamed has come true a hundred times . . . I learned very early in life that ""Without a song, the day would never end; without a song, a man ain\'t got a friend; without a song, the road would never bend - without a song"". So I keep singing a song. Goodnight. Thank you.      There\'s been a big change in the music field in the last 10 or 12 years. I think everything has improved--the sounds have improved, the musicians have improved, the engineers have definitely improved. I like a lot of the new groups, y\'know, The Beatles and The Byrds and the . . . whoever, but I really like a lot of the new music, but a lot of it is basically, our music is basically, rock \'n roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues. People have been adding to it, adding instruments to it, experimenting with it.      I just fell into it, really. My daddy and I were laughing about it the other day. He looked at me and said, ""What happened, El? The last thing I remember is I was working in a can factory and you were driving a truck"". We all feel the same way about it. Still, it just caught us up.      [on performing] It\'s like a surge of electricity going through you. It\'s almost like making love, but it\'s even stronger than that . . . sometimes I think my heart is going to explode.      My daddy had seen a lot of people who played guitars and stuff and didn\'t work, so he said, ""You should make up your mind either about being an electrician or playing a guitar, and I never saw a guitar player that was worth a damn"".      The image is one thing and the human being is another, it\'s very hard to live up to an image.      A live concert to me is exciting because of all the electricity that is generated in the crowd and on stage. It\'s my favorite part of the business - live concerts.      I\'ve never gotten over what they call stage fright. I go through it every show. I\'m pretty concerned, I\'m pretty much thinking about the show. I never get completely comfortable with it, and I don\'t let the people around me get comfortable with it, in that I remind them that it\'s a new crowd out there, it\'s a new audience, and they haven\'t seen us before. So it\'s got to be like the first time we go on.      [at a 1972 press conference in Madison Square Garden] Man, I was tame compared to what they do now, are you kidding? All that I ever did was just jiggle.      I want to entertain people. That\'s my whole life. To my last breath.      The police filmed a show one time in Florida because of the PGA, YMCA, or somebody. They thought that I was . . . something. They said, ""Man, he\'s got to be crazy"". So they, the police, came out and filmed the show. I couldn\'t move. I had to stand still. The only thing I could move was my little finger like that. ""You ain\'t nothing but a hound dog crying all the time"", y\'know, for the whole show.      Take care of the fans and they will sure as hell take care of you.      I don\'t know anything about music. In my line you don\'t have to.      I wiggle my shoulders, I shake my legs, I walk up and down the stage, I hop around on one foot. But I never bump and grind. Why, that\'s vulgar. I\'d never do anything vulgar before an audience. My mother would never allow it.Roy Orbison is the greatest singer in the world.      [in 1956] The colored folks been singing it and playing it just like I\'m doin\' now, man, for more years than I know. They played it like that in their shanties and in their juke joints and nobody paid it no mind \'til I goosed it up. I got it from them. Down in Tupelo, Mississippi, I used to hear old Arthur Crudup bang his box the way I do now and I said if I ever got to a place I could feel all old Arthur felt, I\'d be a music man like nobody ever saw.      I get tired of playing a guy who gets into a fight, then starts singing to the guy he\'s just beat up.      I am not the King. Jesus Christ is the King. I\'m just an entertainer.      Since I was two years old, all I knew was gospel music. That music became such a part of my life it was as natural as dancing. A way to escape from my problems, an my way of release.      [on Blue Hawaii (1961)] In the movie we did a song called the ""Hawaiian Wedding Song"". And it was so real that it took me ten years before I realized I wasn\'t married to the chick.      Truth is like the sun. You can shut it out for a time, but it ain\'t goin\' away.      I sure lost my musical direction in Hollywood. My songs were the same conveyor belt mass production, just like most of my movies were.      Just because you look good, don\'t mean you feel good.      I knew by heart all the dialogue of James Dean\'s films; I could watch Rebel Without a Cause (1955) a hundred times over.      Only thing worse than watching a bad movie is being in one.      Rhythm is something you either have or don\'t have, but when you have it, you have it all over.      Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine.      I can never forget the longing to be someone. I guess if you are poor you always think bigger and want more than those who have everything.      [asked by a reporter in 1972 about his opinion of war protesters] Honey, I\'d just as soon keep my own personal views about that to myself. I\'m just an entertainer, and I\'d rather not say.      The image is one thing and the human being is another. I try very hard to live up to an image, I\'ll put it that way.      It\'s your baby, you rock it.      [from a letter delivered to President Nixon\'s office on December 21, 1970] Sir, I can and will be of any I service that I can to help the country out. I have no concern or motive other than helping the country out, so I wish not to be given a title or an appointed position. I can and will do more good if I were made a Federal Agent at Large, and I will help best by doing it my way through my communications with people of all ages.

She studied both drama and dance under Martha Graham, did some modeling and then worked in stock companies and on television, dancing on Jackie Gleason shows. She acted in just a handful of motion pictures, garnering an Academy Award nomination for one, and later won two Emmys for her best-loved role on television.Hope was one of four children of an actress mother, upon whose shoulders fell the responsibility of supporting the family after the premature death of her father, the composer/arranger John Lange, in 1942. Along with her siblings, she worked as a waitress in the family\'s Greenwich Village restaurant, \'Minette\'s of Washington Square\'. By chance, she made the acquaintance of Eleanor Roosevelt, who owned an apartment in the village, and ended up walking the former First Lady\'s prized Scotch terrier, Fala. This got her photo into a newspaper, which, in turn, led to an advertising job with pictures on the June 1949 cover of \'Radio-Electronics\', sporting the futuristic red \'Man from Mars\' pith helmet with built-in radio. Still just fifteen years old, Hope spent the next two years at college in Oregon and New York, then found her first job in television and was subsequently signed by 20th Century-Fox.After successful screen tests, Lange made her motion picture debut in Bus Stop (1956) (Barbara Eden was one of her competitors for the part) opposite Marilyn Monroe and husband-to-be Don Murray. Even the great Marilyn was said to have felt a little threatened by another blonde who was not only beautiful but five years younger and could act as well. After playing the wife of the titular character in The True Story of Jesse James (1957), a picture which she later referred to as a \'turkey\', Lange was cast as the fragile Selena Cross in the melodramatic but good-looking soap opera Peyton Place (1957). This movie was regarded as risquÃ© and controversial at the time, dealing with previously taboo subjects such as rape and incest. For her part of the abused girl, raped by her alcoholic stepfather, whom she finally kills in self-defense, Lange received an Academy Award nomination.The glossy production values of The Best of Everything (1959), a film about ambitious New York career women working in a magazine publishing house, overshadowed most of the character development. However, Lange (who was billed above the established star Joan Crawford) was dealt with most favorably by the critics. According to Bosley Crowther of The New York Times: ""Simply because she has the most to do, and does it gracefully, Miss Lange comes off best\' (October 9,1959). The following decade was to be a period of mixed fortunes for Hope Lange.In 1961, Lange began a long-standing relationship with fellow actor Glenn Ford and left husband Don Murray. Ford, in his dual role of star and associate producer, put pressure on director Frank Capra to cast Lange as the female lead in his next motion picture, the whimsical Damon Runyon-inspired comedy Pocketful of Miracles (1961), even though Shirley Jones had already been assigned to the role. Capra reluctantly gave way, though Hope Lange was likely miscast as the wisecracking showgirl. Lange again co-starred with Ford in the glossy romantic melodrama Love Is a Ball (1963), wherein acting took a back seat to sumptuous costumes and the French Riviera. On the negative side of the ledger, Lange had unsuccessfully auditioned for the part of Maria in West Side Story (1961), which ultimately went to Natalie Wood. Instead, she was cast as Elvis Presley\'s psychiatrist in Wild in the Country (1961), which was generally panned by critics, except for Variety singling out her performance above the rest as \'intelligent\' and \'sensitive\'. Lange was also slated to appear as love interest to George Peppard in How the West Was Won (1962), but her scenes ended up on the cutting room floor.Turning increasingly towards television, Hope Lange achieved her most lasting fame as the popular star of the amiable sitcom The Ghost & Mrs. Muir (1968) as a widow who (with two kids and a housekeeper) takes up residence in a quaint cottage also inhabited by the cantankerous ghost of a sea captain (Edward Mulhare). The show ran for three seasons and Lange won two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Comedy Series (1969 and 1970). In her only other recurring TV role, she played Dick Van Dyke\'s wife in The New Dick Van Dyke Show (1971), but with less rewarding results. She received good notices for portraying Charles Bronson\'s dying wife, the victim of the original Death Wish (1974) and its raison d\'etre. She then acted primarily on television, with few exceptions, including Blue Velvet (1986) and Clear and Present Danger (1994) as a U.S. senator. In 1977, she replaced Tony Award-winning Ellen Burstyn in the starring role of Doris in \'Same Time, Next Year\' on Broadway.In the early \'90s, Lange underwent surgery for a brain tumour. While the operation was successful, her health remained precarious and she limited her screen appearances, retiring altogether in 1998. She died of an intestinal infection in December 2003, aged 70.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       I.S.Mowis          Spouse (3)               Charles Hollerith, Jr.          (29 January\xa01986            - 19 December\xa02003)\xa0(her death)           Alan J.

With her ex-husband, Don Murray, they had a son, actor Christopher Murray, and a daughter, Patricia Murray. The marriage was dissolved in 1961.      In 1968, Lange turned to television, taking on the role of Carolyn Muir in the popular series The Ghost & Mrs. Muir (1968). She won two consecutive Emmys for that role, in 1969 and 1970.      Lange earned the only Oscar nomination of her career for her supporting role in the provocative film Peyton Place (1957), in which she murders her rapist stepfather.      Made her acting debut on Broadway at the age of 11 in Sidney Kingsley\'s play ""The Patriots"".      When she co-starred with Marilyn Monroe in Bus Stop (1956), Monroe disliked the presence of a younger blonde and sent a series of memos to producers and the director, even suggesting that Lange be made to dye her hair brown.      For two years, Lange lived in a sparsely furnished home with crates for coffee tables and only a box spring and mattress for her bed. ""She put all her money into the refugee project because that is the kind of person she was"", Don Murray said.      As of 2014, she and Nan Martin [Amanda Krueger in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987)] are the only deceased cast members of the Nightmare on Elm Street films.      She delivered a stirring eulogy at the funeral for her close friend, Natalie Wood.      Biography in: ""The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives"". Volume 7, 2003-2005, pages 323-324.

She was the niece of photographer Dorothea Lange, famous for her Depression-era photographs, including the iconic ""Migrant Mother"".      Hope appeared on Radio-Electronics magazine, June 1949 cover wearing the ""Man from Mars"" Radio Hat.      Would occasionally walk Fala, a Scotch terrier belonging to former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.      Studied dance with Martha Graham.Personal Quotes (1)      [on working with Joan Crawford on The Best of Everything (1959)] ""I was fortunate that there was this tension with her.

When her father, Lathrop Motley Weld, died three years later at the age of 49, the cute little girl, whose name by then had somehow been transmogrified into ""Tuesday"", took over the role of the family breadwinner, which included her mother Yosene Balfour Ker. She became a successful child model, posing for advertisements and mail-order catalogs. Her work and the burden of responsibility estranged her from her mother Yosene, her two elder siblings, and forced the preteen girl into adulthood. At nine years of age, she suffered a nervous breakdown; at ten, she started heavy drinking; one year later, she began having relationships with older men, all of which led to a suicide attempt at age twelve. In 1956 she debuted in the low-budget exploitation movie Rock Rock Rock! (1956) and decided to become an actress. After numerous TV appearances in New York she went to Hollywood in 1958 and was cast for Rally \'Round the Flag, Boys! (1958), something of a breakthrough for her. Over the next few years Tuesday became Hollywood\'s queen of teen, playing mainly precocious sex kittens. Her wild private life added to the entertainment of her fans. Critics acknowledged her talent, directors approved of her professionalism, and in the late 1960s she even managed to grow out of her child/woman image and find more demanding roles - she had been ""sweet little 16"" for about 16 years. However, Tuesday Weld didn\'t achieve first-magnitude stardom. Maybe she was just unlucky with her selection of jobs (she turned down Lolita (1962), Bonnie and Clyde (1967), True Grit (1969), Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969), among others); maybe her independence-loving mind made her instinctively shrink back from the restraints of super stardom. In any case, she kept on performing well in films that had either not much flair or not much success. From the mid-\'70s on she focused more and more on made-for-TV movies, which was ironic in that the best (Once Upon a Time in America (1984)) and the most successful (Falling Down (1993)) films that came her way happened after her big-screen career had pretty much petered out.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Christoph Heuke <c_heuke@hotmail.com>          Spouse (3) Pinchas Zukerman (18 October\xa01985            - 13 December\xa01998)\xa0(divorced)           Dudley Moore (20 September\xa01975            - 18 July\xa01980)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)           Claude Harz (23 October\xa01965            - 18 February\xa01971)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)          Trade Mark (2)        Platinum blonde hair and green eyes        Curvaceous figureTrivia (27)      Featured on the cover of the album ""Girlfriend"" by Matthew Sweet. [1991]      Was considered for the title roles in Lolita (1962) and Norma Rae (1979).      Turned down the role of Bonnie in Bonnie and Clyde (1967).      She was director Roman Polanski\'s first choice for the title role in Rosemary\'s Baby (1968) because he thought her pure, American looks would contrast well with the film\'s dark undertones. The studio preferred Mia Farrow, however, who had become a star on the enormously popular night-time soap opera Peyton Place (1964). A few years later, Polanski wanted her to star in his film version of The Tragedy of Macbeth (1971). She lost the part when she refused to do a nude sleepwalking scene. The role was eventually played by Francesca Annis.      When asked by a reporter what drove her into seclusion in the 1970s, she answered, ""I think it was a Buick.""      Turned down the films Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969), True Grit (1969) and Cactus Flower (1969).      Gave birth to her 1st child at age 23, a daughter Natasha Harz on August 26, 1966. Child\'s father was her 1st ex-husband, Claude Harz.      Gave birth to her 2nd child at age 32, a son Patrick H. Moore on February 26, 1976. Child\'s father was her 2nd ex-husband, Dudley Moore.      Graduated from Hollywood Professional School in 1960 and was the class valedictorian.      Singer Walter Egan recorded ""Tuesday Weld"", his self-penned tribute to the actress, on his 1980 album ""The Last Stroll"".Donald Fagen mentions her in his song ""New Frontier"" on the album ""The Nightfly"": ""Introduce me to that big blonde/She\'s got a touch of Tuesday Weld.""      Refused to screen test (as did Natalie Wood) for the part of Daisy Buchanan in the 1974 remake of The Great Gatsby (1974).      1958 Deb Star.      The first year she was on the set of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis (1959) she was mobbed so much by the press that she finally cut them off entirely. After that her name was seldom mentioned when the show was written about.      In Tiny Tim\'s recording of George M. Cohan\'s song ""Then I\'d be Satisfied with Life"" (on his 1968 album ""God Bless Tiny Tim""), he changes the line ""If Hettie Green would only be my wife"" to ""If Tuesday Weld would only be my wife"".      Born at 01:34 AM (EWT).      Was considered to play Mrs. Lovett in a film version of the musical ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"", but she passed on the role as time went on. When it was finally made in the 2000s, the role went to Helena Bonham Carter.      Sold her homes in New York in Manhattan, and beach house in Montauk and is now living in Colorado near Aspen.      First cousin of ex Governor William Weld of Massachussetts and both their lineages precede the founding fathers. The Weld name is on more buildings at Harvard in honor of her family establishing the University and is one of the most important family lineages in America.      Weld lives in Aspen area and has turned down work for over 10 years. Her major agents still send her scripts weekly, but she is writing and close to her daughter and granddaughter. She is offered ""mother roles"" on hit series, but looks better than her years. [June 2010]      In 1971 the 8th Street Playhouse in New York\'s Greenwich Village hosted a Tuesday Weld Film Festival.      Weld and her Wild in the Country (1961) co-star Hope Lange both portrayed the character of Selena Cross; Weld in the movie sequel Return to Peyton Place (1961) , Lange in the original film Peyton Place (1957).      Actor Anthony Perkins and actress Dina Merrill (both of whom were co-stars) are Weld\'s third cousins.      Tuesday was born on a Friday.      Had to withdraw from Performance (1970) due to an injury before shooting began.      Was in the running for the role of the mother in Poltergeist (1982) which went to JoBeth Williams.      Turned down the role of Janet in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975).Personal Quotes (10)      I do not ever want to be a huge star. Do you think I want a success? I refused Bonnie and Clyde (1967) because I was nursing at the time but also because deep down I knew that it was going to be a huge success. The same was true of ""Bob and Carol and Fred and Sue"" or whatever it was called [Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969)]. It reeked of success.      [about Elvis Presley] He walked into a room and everything stopped. Elvis was just so physically beautiful that even if he didn\'t have any talent . . . just his face, just his presence. And he was funny, charming, and complicated, but he didn\'t wear it on his sleeve. You didn\'t see that he was complicated. You saw great needs.      It seems the brighter you are, the deeper the hole you get into.      [on her reputation as a ""wild child""] As a teenager, I was a wreck. I drank so much I can\'t remember anything.      [on Sue Lyon] I don\'t think of her as an actress or otherwise. She just doesn\'t occupy that much of my mind. I don\'t know her.      [Asked about a 1971 Tuesday Weld Film festival] I was astonished. That\'s an honor usually reserved for someone like Garbo or Bogart.      [After being asked why she turns down sure hits like ""Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice""] It reeked of success. I may be self-destructive, but I like taking chances with movies. I like challenges, and I also like the particular position I\'ve been in all these years, with people wanting to save me from the awful films I\'ve been in... I think the Tuesday Weld cult is a very nice thing.      [In a 1972 interview] I don\'t like interviews because your brain can be picked. That\'s not nice anywhere - even in a living room.      [About ""Pretty Poison""] Don\'t talk to me about it. I couldn\'t bear Noel Black even speaking to me. When he said \'Good morning,\' it destroyed my day.      [About her mother] I hated Mama.

Funny thing. My local video store had this movie listed under

It is the one valid dramatic effort of Elvis' career, and easily the
best picture he ever starred in. He sings exactly two musical numbers,
both are fairly natural in sequences in the film. The first one early
in the film while riding with sweetheart Millie Perkins (as Billie Lee)
in a pickup truck. . . is a bit musical-ISH, if you will, in that it
sort of comes out of a stylization contrivance of the film-makers. Yet
it is very romantic and sweet. The other one is a serenade to Tuesday
Weld (Noreen in the movie) that is very comfortably meshed in with this
heartfelt story. Anyway, Elvis plays a young man, Glenn, who comes from
a troubled past, evolving from country roots that were wild and
unsettled between his father and mother. His father was a lazy good for
nothing. His mother, who died in his childhood, is depicted as having
been a good hearted woman. So Glenn gets in trouble with the law when
he nearly kills his brother in a fight. His father wants him to go to
jail, but a compassionate parole board, advised by psychiatrist Irene
Sperry (Hope Lange) allows him one more chance with his uncle, where he
helps with his uncle's distillery. His uncle has a daughter, Noreen,
who has a child but no husband,(wonderfully played by Tuesday Weld) who
is kind of wild like Glenn (but also tender hearted). In a complicated
plot Glenn has both Noreen and Billie Lee to consider. Millie Perkins,
as Billie Lee, is also quite inspiring and sweet. Eventually, as Glenn
gets in more and more trouble, he ends up falling for the psychiatrist
widow Sperry, and at that point he has more women troubles than any man
SHOULD have. . . .BUT. . .it's all good. He gets discovered by the
psychiatrist for his natural talent, WRITING! Believe me, the troubles
this guy has. . . all of us guys would like to be burdened with. Some
of the beautiful scenery from the Smokey mountains in Tennessee is
quite stunning. Also, I really enjoyed the natural quality that can
never be found nowadays in period pieces from the same era (1961). The
cars are distinctly authentic, for instance, not all pristine
conditioned masterpieces. I give this movie all 10 stars just from the
sweet effort given by cast and film makers to NOT make just another
money making Elvis vehicle, but a compassionate dramatic tale of moral
strength and sweetness.

This film is a great movie for its fighting scenes and its music score and
its drama and wonderful script. Elvis acts amazingly well with Hope Lange.
There is a sadness to the movie when the character played by Elvis starts to

This film (written by Clifford Odets of all people) is one of the better

""A troubled young man discovers that he has a knack for writing when a
counselor encourages him to pursue a literary career."" Do me a favour:
Do not think of this movie as any other Elvis flick, because this is
one of the best classic films I've seen. Well, he sings a couple songs
to his lovers and he gets into a couple of fights, but here it just
doesn't happen randomly. The plot is excellent and Elvis blew me away
with his acting. There's one specific scene where he's sharing stories
about his dead mother with Hope Lange and it almost brought me to
tears. His acting was very natural, as was Hope Lange's, Tuesday Weld's
and Millie Perkins'. This is a fantastic movie and I hope you'll enjoy
it as much as I did.

A beautiful and passionate screenplay by Clifford Odets. Elvis plays a
brawling delinquent with a hidden literary talent. Three women compete for
his attention, lust and future.  Millie Perkins plays the childhood
sweetheart.  Tuesday Weld is outstanding as the seductive cousin. The older
of the three, Hope Lange, is an understanding psychiatrist trying to lead
Elvis' character to college. The songs in this drama are limited, but
highlighted by ""I Slipped, I Stumbled, I Fell"". An emotional performance
turned in by Elvis.  Some say this is one of his best movies.  Watch it

J.R. Salamanca's book ""The Lost Country"", adapted for the screen by
Clifford Odets (!), becomes decent though somewhat stodgy melodrama
featuring Elvis Presley as southern delinquent who shows promise as a
writer, counseled by a female psychologist who believes in him. Critics
at the time were calling for Elvis to start doing some decent dramatic
work, yet when this picture was released it was mostly ignored (it is
often cited as the one Presley-vehicle which failed to turn a profit).
The females in the cast (Hope Lange, Tuesday Weld and Millie Perkins)
are strong screen-matches for Elvis, and the plotting is good when it
isn't being overripe. As for the star, he does his typical thing:
singing just a few songs, but performing in his usual shy and
self-conscious, overly-polite low key. **1/2 from ****

Wild in the Country is a solid film and one of Presley's best. <br><br>Elvis is excellent as a delinquent who happens to be a potentially terrific

Elvis only sings a couple of songs here and therefore, instead of a musical,
we get a dramatic story that's well acted by all three leads and is
genuinely captivating, only falls short towards the end and goes for a sappy

Overall, one of Presley's best films and he once again proves what a great

the death of his mother as a child and being guilty until proven innocent

This film is a tragedy, to me, in that it basically marks the end of
Elvis'
aspiration to be a 'serious' actor, an aspiration that he was quite
capable
of realizing.  He'd still display flashes of brilliance in his '60s
musical
comedies, and he yet had the stellar ""Follow That Dream"" and the somewhat
lesser ""Kid Galahad"" (as well as some late '60s roles) to come, but this
film represents his last successful all-out stab at a dramatic role.
Elvis
plays a country boy, named Glenn Tyler, who's possessed of an enormous
talent for writing -- encouraged by his now-dead mother -- but who lacks
formal education and the supportive environment needed to allow that
talent
to bloom.  After a series of run-ins with the law, at least some of them
undeserved, Glenn is removed to his uncle's custody and it's when he's
assigned a female case worker who recognizes his potential that things
really begin to change.<br><br>Hope Lange plays the proverbial older woman, a fixture of many Elvis
movies.
Pouty Tuesday Weld plays a prematurely world-weary teenaged mother who
represents the fork in Glenn's road that leads to a life less than what he
was capable of.  Millie Perkins plays the girl from the 'right' side of
the
tracks whose father looks down on Glenn and his ilk and who represents a
path that would take him firmly into the heart of Middle America (southern
style).  Hope Lange turns out to be the third path, perhaps propelling
Glenn
to where he might realize his fullest personal potential.  Ironically
enough, Tuesday Weld played a woman delivered a kidnapped Elvis in 1988's
""Heartbreak Hotel"" and Millie Perkins played Elvis' mother in the
excellent
1990 TV series, ""Elvis - The early Years.""<br><br>Red West, Elvis' former bodyguard and friend since high-school days, plays
Elvis' hood/redneck brother in the film.  He acquits himself well, though
those of us who don't think that anything could justify his participation
in
the 1977 'tell-a''' book, ""Elvis - What Happened?"" might perhaps revel in
the sound thrashing that Elvis delivers to Red at the film's beginning.
Superathlete Rafer Johnson -- fresh from winning an Olympic gold medal for
decathlon -- appeared in this film and Christina Crawford made her film
debut here.  Other familiar faces include Alan Napier (known to many as
Alfred, the butler, in the '60s ""Batman"" series) and Gary Lockwood (Elvis'
partner in ""It Happened At The World's Fair"").  William Mims is great in
his
role as the sleazy uncle.  Jason Robards, father of Junior, made his last
screen appearance in this film.  For some reason, the film -- though set
in
the South -- was shot in the Napa Valley region of Northern
California.<br><br>This film deals with adult themes and it's perhaps not surprising that
both
Hope Lange and Tuesday Weld featured in ""Peyton Place"" properties.  I
understand that the ""Peyton Place"" franchise defined the modern soap
opera,
at least the prime-time kind.  ""Wild In The Country"" is, at heart, a bit
of
a soap opera.  I believe that the film was shot with two or three
endings --
at least one had a suicide (can't recall if it was Elvis' or Hope
Lange's),
but they ended up going with the more upbeat conclusion.<br><br>In all, I find this film a bit tedious to watch, perhaps explaining why
I've
only seen it twice now.  I don't have a short attention span, but certain
movies make me wonder if I'm developing one and this film falls somewhat
into that category.  As much as anything, perhaps it's a just a little too
soapy for me, though a beautifully-realized film packed with convincing
characterizations.  Still, to me, it pales beside the excellent ""Flaming
Star.""   However, I've seen films far more glacial in pacing and many are
lauded as 'art' -- to me they're just boring -- and this one, at least,
has
Elvis!  And, to be fair, it tells a good story and does so in a
well-crafted
way.  The songs separate this one from ""Flaming Star,"" too, though few in
number and every one is worked into the script naturally.  Two of the
songs
cut from the film are as perfectly beautiful as the ballad that Elvis
sings
to Tuesday and were recorded in two versions, one with guitar only (for
the
film) and the other with added instrumentation and voices.  The producers,
at least, were trying to get away from the typical 'unrealistic' musical
thing wherein music and voices come from nowhere.<br><br>In this film Elvis again proved his tremendous potential as an actor, and
is
totally believable for most of his screen time (he does a great 'drunk'
scene with Tuesday Weld, too).  The film may not be as solid and tight as
""Flaming Star"" but Elvis' performance is still very strong and he is again
ably supported by an excellent cast.  It's nothing short of tragic that
Elvis' acting ability would never again be explored to the extent that it
was in this and the other 1960 Fox film that Elvis did, ""Flaming Star.""
By
the time that Elvis finished the '60s and got around to filming some
atypical movies (e.g., ""Charro!,"" ""The Trouble With Girls,"" and ""Change Of
Habit"") the damage was already done and the films were subverted either by
substandard scripting or by Elvis' own lack of enthusiasm for what had
become, over the preceding seven years or so, increasingly a despised
exercise in commercialism.  Unfortunately, ""Wild In The Country"" failed to
even live up to the mild box-office reception that ""Flaming Star"" had
generated, and we'll never know how things might have turned out
differently
had Elvis continued to make high-quality dramas (comedies and adventure
yarns, for that matter) instead of the lightweight musical 'vehicles' that
largely became the norm.  About four months after filming ""Wild In The
Country"" Elvis began work on ""Blue Hawaii,"" quickly to become his most
successful film of the 33 that he made, and the rest is
history.

Elvis Presley as a hell-raising juvenile delinquent?  I don't think so. 
That's what `Wild in the Country' would have us believe, but in reality he's
the only honest and decent male in the movie.  He plays a misunderstood
young man from a poor white trash background who is sent to a psychologist
as part of his parole after he gets into trouble (which he often does
through no real fault of his own, naturally).  Hope Lange plays the `older
woman,' who discovers a budding literary talent in her charge.  However,
according to director Philip Dunne's memoirs the part was originally offered
to Simone Signoret (!).  Contemplating this pairing is more exciting than
anything that happens in this movie.  Miss Lange gives it a good try, but
she was only about 3 years older than Elvis.  Signoret would have made a man
out of him in no time!  This was supposed to be Presley's big dramatic
breakthrough in a non-singing role, but according to Dunne, the bosses at
Fox insisted upon interpolating songs.  The movie also suffers from the
Production Code censorship of the time (no actual going to bed with Lange,
thank you), and Elvis was too nice to be really bad.  Considering all the
strikes against it, it's surprising that `Country' is still as watchable as
it is.  Presley is as good as he's allowed to be, and Tuesday Weld also
spices things up as the requisite `bad girl' who tempts him.  Call this one
a `bad movie to love.'

Funny thing. My local video store had this movie listed under
""musicals"". If there is one thing this picture is NOT, it is a musical.
It is the one valid dramatic effort of Elvis' career, and easily the
best picture he ever starred in. He sings exactly two musical numbers,
both are fairly natural in sequences in the film. The first one early
in the film while riding with sweetheart Millie Perkins (as Billie Lee)
in a pickup truck. . . is a bit musical-ISH, if you will, in that it
sort of comes out of a stylization contrivance of the film-makers. Yet
it is very romantic and sweet. The other one is a serenade to Tuesday
Weld (Noreen in the movie) that is very comfortably meshed in with this
heartfelt story. Anyway, Elvis plays a young man, Glenn, who comes from

He later earned an Oscar nomination for this role.      As an aspiring actor in the mid-1950s, he made the rounds with Michael Polley, the father of Sarah Polley. Michael Polley says that Finney compared actors to bricklayers, in terms of craft.      Was the first choice of Laurence Olivier to take over his post as the head of Britain\'s National Theatre.

However, he had found the make-up he had to wear for the first movie Murder on the Orient Express (1974) very uncomfortable in the hot interior of the train, and on realizing that he would have to undergo the same experience, this time in temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit, he declined the role.      The third choice for Hercule Poirot in Murder on the Orient Express (1974). Before him were Alec Guinness and Paul Scofield. Ironically, Agatha Christie felt Finney\'s performance came closest to her idea of Poirot.      In 1965, he formed Memorial Films in association with Michael Medwin to produce theatrical features, which included Charlie Bubbles (1967), If.... (1968), Gumshoe (1971), Bleak Moments (1971), O Lucky Man! (1973) and Law and Disorder (1974).

Rather than attend the Oscar ceremony in 1964, he went on vacation sailing in the South Seas. When informed that he had been beaten as Best Actor by Sidney Poitier, he offered Poitier his heartfelt congratulations.

I think the Sir thing slightly perpetuates one of our diseases in England, which is snobbery. And it also helps keep us \'quaint,\' which I\'m not a great fan of. You don\'t get much with the title anymore. That was all carved up by the robber barons in the Middle Ages.      [speaking in 1961] ""My job is acting, and that is why I hate interviews or lectures, explaining myself to an audience.""      I\'m not the romantic type ... I\'m a bit like the late, great Peter Sellers, only happy in character roles.      After I played a homosexual character in A Man of No Importance (1994), an American journalist asked if I\'d have a rainbow flag on my car\'s bumper. I said I don\'t \'do\' bumper stickers, but if I did, I\'d be pleased to use that one. After all, everyone\'s included in the rainbow, aren\'t they?

He was like a second father to me in many ways, which I know may sound odd considering I was 45 when I first worked with him, but when you had to say goodbye there was always this feeling of loss, that terrible sadness that you\'d be deprived of his company. I\'ve seen more films by him than anybody else on the planet.      [1967 comment on director Karel Reisz] I think Karel is very good with actors; he\'s very interested in the actors creating a character and not just relying on personality, he\'s good at encouraging actors to explore the characterization, and I think that\'s the kind of acting I\'m interested in.Salary (2)The Duellists\xa0(1977)       A case of champagne      Annie\xa0(1982)      $1,000,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nDiane Venora ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 9 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(1)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(5)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(1)  Overview (1)Date of Birth10\xa0August1952,\xa0Hartford, Connecticut, USA Mini Bio (1)          Diane Venora was born Diana Venora in East Hartford Connecticut.

His family was of Mexican descent. If Olmos had followed the first love of his life, he would have been a professional baseball player. But by age 13, another love entered his life: rock music. By age 15, he was already an experienced rock singer, forming and reforming several ""garage bands"" along the way. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, he played the most famous clubs on Sunset Strip, including Gazzarri\'s and The Factory. But a friend suggested that, with his flair for the dramatic, he consider a career in acting. Throughout the 1970s, he divided his time between rock music gigs, acting classes, bit parts in television, Off-off-off Broadway plays and his business of moving fine furniture (which kept body, soul and family together). His first big break was a starring role in Luis Valdez\'s play, ""Zoot Suit"", in 1978. The play moved to Broadway and led to a Tony Award nomination and great critical acclaim.Perhaps best known for his role as Lt. Martin Castillo in the NBC television series Miami Vice (1984) (1984-1989), Olmos has been seen in numerous film and television productions. He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his starring role in Stand and Deliver (1988). Most notable of his recent offerings is American Me (1992), which was also his directing debut. But acting, directing and screenwriting are only parts of what he does. Olmos contends he would much rather be known as an activist than an actor. He devotes much of his time to causes, particularly those focusing on the needs and rights of children. He makes, on average, some 150 personal appearances a year to places where he can reach kids at risk; juvenile halls, detention centers, boys/girls clubs, schools. Anywhere he can get across his message that ""we all have a choice"" about where life takes us.Olmos stresses the importance of education, the risks of gang life and tries to promote the notion of taking responsibility for one\'s own actions and one\'s own happiness in life. Using his own ""disadvantaged background"" as an example (he grew up in East Los Angeles, infamous for its gang problems), he tells the kids, ""If I can do it, so can you"". And he tries to point them in a positive direction. He has served as an ambassador for UNICEF and has received numerous accolades for his activism. He will long be remembered for getting out in the thick of the Los Angeles Riots of 1992 with his broom: one calm, reasonable presence in the midst of chaos and gunfire.

An almost forgotten gem. I really liked the eery atmosphere in this
one; great actors, great music - and really outstanding cinematography.
I've never seen New York portrayed as grim and terrifying - and yet as
beautiful - as in this film. I wouldn't call this a werewolf movie and
it's certainly not your usual horror film either; although it does have
many characteristics of a genre movie (even some pre-Predator style
distorted camera effects), it is very much its own beast. There are no
fancy transformations, no groundbreaking visual effects from the likes
of Rick Baker, Rob Bottin or Stan Winston - but there are superb
visuals of another kind. And there's tension, suspense and a
fascinating story that gripped me right from the start. There are also
some very graphic, gory moments, but they are few and far between.
Director Michael Wadleigh has an interesting background: he was the
dude who made history in 1969 by making Woodstock happen. He took
Strieber's werewolf novel and brought something personal to it. Call it
a mythical eco-horror thriller if you will, it's certainly something
special. 7 out of 10 from me.<br><br>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br><br>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br><br>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br><br>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/

""They can hear a cloud pass overhead, the rhythm of your blood. They
can track you by yesterday's shadow. And they can tear the scream from
your throat. There is no defense."" I love it when you can tell a movie
is gonna be great just from it's tagline. Wolfen is one of the most
thoroughly underrated films of the 80's if not film history. From
moment one with it's dreamy, monochromatic, animalistic tracking shots
Wolfen sets itself up as a different kind of werewolf film. With Wolfen
you get three movies in one a Dirty Harry-esquire cop investigation
movie with Albert Finney and Gregory Harrison turning in fine
performances as the ones investigating. A graphically intense horror
film, with a menacingly sadistic, creepily cool performance from Edward
James Olmos and of course the barely there ""Wolfen"" creatures. Lastly
you get a statement on environmental issues and the hierarchy of
society. Tom Noonan in his pre-Manhunter existence gives the movie a
touch of class as an animal lover who wants to study the ""Wolfen."" If
you're expecting a comedic werewolf movie such as ""The Howling"" or ""An
American Werewolf in London"" this film isn't for you. But if you want a
great suspense mystery, with dazzling visuals and one of the greatest
endings in history check Wolfen out.

Wolfen is something different to the many monster films floating around.
If
you watch this film expecting to see the usual mix of no brain slash and
gore then you will perhaps be disappointed or as was in my case pleasantly
surprised. Reading from other comments on this film it is easy to see that
it has been widely misunderstood.<br><br>Wolfen is not a Werewolf/Horror film although at times it does attempt to
be
so, which is where the confusion arises for the viewer. On one side we
have
the Wolfen portrayed as highly evolved beings merely protecting their
environment yet on the other side they shown to be remorseless killers as
and where the plot dictates. However do not let this paradox put you off a
film that is both scary and genuinely thought provoking.<br><br>The scenes set in and around areas of urban decay, particularly that of
the
church, are chilling and suspenseful. Whilst the Wolfen POV camera work is
groundbreaking and still effective by today's standards. Wolfen on the
whole
is a well made film, excellent use of music (or lack of it)to generate
suspense and quality actors and acting help bring you into the story
behind
the Wolfen.<br><br>For those that wish to critisise the beach scene when Edward James Olmos
dances naked across the sand as demeaning to Indians, well I think they're
rather missing the point. Surely the film is trying to show the prejudices
of Albert Finney's character rather than belittle any Indian
custom.<br><br>In summary a film with a message that chooses to show intelligence and
reason in its horrors.

The vicious, bloody homicide of a prominent businessman, his wife, and
bodyguard in New York's Battery Park brings shaggy detective Dewey
Wilson out to investigate. The three victims were partially
dismembered, and forensics finds non-human evidence on the bodies and
body parts. From that captivating start, Michael Wadleigh's 1981
mystery-thriller, ""Wolfen,"" holds viewer interest throughout. Other
corpses surface during the course of the investigation, and,
mysteriously, while some body parts seem to have been gnawed or eaten,
diseased or cancerous organs were rejected. While rarely straying off
course, this engrossing film adds a dose of Native American mysticism
and lore to unraveling the series of murders. Although Wilson is not a
particularly demanding role, Albert Finney brings a weary depth of
character that enhances what could have been a stock character. Diane
Venora is adequate as Rebecca Neff, Wilson's co-worker and love
interest, but Gregory Hines is excellent as the forensics expert, and
Tom Noonan brightens his few scenes as a wolf enthusiast.<br><br>Based on a novel by Whitley Strieber, Wadleigh, who also co-wrote the
script with David Eyre, alludes to the killers' identity, but wisely
keeps them off screen throughout most of the film. When only a pair of
evil red eyes peer through the darkness, the imagination creates the
horror. The killings and victims are subjectively seen through the
killers's eyes with cinematographer Gerry Fisher's striking use of
thermographic images, which add a surreal element. However, Fisher's
non-thermographic photography is equally beautiful and turns the empty
shells of churches and apartment buildings in the South Bronx into an
otherworldly landscape consistent with the supernatural aspects of the
story.<br><br>Unfortunately, the eerie buildup and savagery of the murders create
expectations that the final revelation cannot meet. However, despite a
climax that brings the story to a soft-landing, ""Wolfen"" delivers for
most of its running time. With a fine understated performance by
Finney, evocative photography by Fisher, and a taut script by Wadleigh
and Eyre, ""Wolfen"" is a gem from the early 1980's that deserves to be
rediscovered.

After years of reading and watching all the werewolf stuff I can get my
hands on, I finally got around to reading and then watching Wolfen, and
I was blown away by the gorgeous, chilling cinematography. You may take
me at my word that I have seldom seen a film that was able to build the
tension of what you don't see, and reward you when you finally do see
it: I have never seen real wolves used so well, or shot so beautifully.
As in the book, the Wolfen are both terrifying and yet somehow noble,
and you respect the antagonism between them and the human characters
(played very well by Albert Finney and co.), and while the ending is
somewhat anticlimactic as opposed to its book counterpart, I was still
quite pleased with the film as a whole. The introduction of the Native
American element into the movie's version of the story made sense and
was enjoyable (though E.J. Olmos's nudity was a little much), and I
should also mention that the shots of New York were atmospheric and
gorgeous as well, and when combined with the werewolf element, make a
truly one-of-a-kind horror film. A must for werewolf fans, though
they're not werewolves in the strictest sense, but a creatures as
unique as their film: The Wolfen.

Wolfen is absolutely a classic of the horror genre. Released in
succession after the likes of Altered States, The Howling and An
American Werewolf in London it actually provides more tension than the
rest because it doesn't overdo the creature effects. The Howling is
probably the most famous of the three films yet after purchasing and
watching the blu-ray I realized something 33 years later... It's just
not scary. The transformations are graphic but feel too long and drawn
out now. As an adult I find that werewolves just are no longer scary.
Neither is Dracula. At least American Werewolf was funny and had a
charismatic lead. Where Wolfen exceeds it's genre roots is in it's
attention to plot details and character development. Albert Finney is
believable as a burned out cop and Gregory Hines is a treat as his co-
star/sidekick the coroner. There are scenes in this film that work on a
suspense level that few others can muster and the abandoned tenements
provide a creepy location for their two man reconnaissance. As far as
80's horror goes this is essential viewing.

Unusual film that takes a very different path from the traditional
werewolf movie. Low budget in feel, which is good, this starts
incredibly well with horror, gore and bewilderment. The use of the
negative image when we see through the eyes of the wolves is great, its
less plastic than ordinary SFX and far more realistic than CGI, its
also cheap (I've used it myself!) but the best thing about it is that
it is literally an inversion of reality, which is just what you want
here. Finney is fine but maybe should have been encouraged to put a
little more effort in. As for his co-star, Diane Venora, in her first
film, her lack of presence is worrying. I guess first time director
(apart from Woodstock work) Michael Wadleigh was not used to getting
the best out of his actors and indeed never made another film. Not to
take away from this little gem though, not perfect by any means but
different enough and occasionally startling enough to make at least one
viewing essential.

When a famous tycoon, his wife, and his bodyguard are brutally murdered
in Battery Park, a cynical detective (Albert Finney) is assigned to the

Michael Wadleigh, whose only other directorial effort was the Woodstock
documentary. It's a shame he didn't do more because he does show a good
deal of talent here. Predator fans will notice this movie uses a
similar visual technique for the wolves' point of view, including
similar sound effects, years before the first Predator movie. The cast
is excellent and the script is pretty good, if a little packed. Nice
cinematography from Gerry Fisher and use of actual Bronx locations
helps in creating a fine atmosphere. It's a very interesting film that
tackles a number of subjects (probably too many). Monster movie fans
might balk at the lack of any ""wolf men,"" but the strength of the movie
is not in its special effects or gore, but in its story and how it's
presented. Keep an open mind and give it a shot and I'm sure you'll
find something to like about Wolfen. I've seen it a few times now and
each time it gets better.

I like to make movies about characters. I like smaller films, that\'s what I love to do.      (2008, on Hollywood) I don\'t know how it works. There\'s been times when I\'ve wondered, \'Why the fuck am I not getting that movie?\' There\'s so much to this game like who\'s hot and all that. If you stay true and work with great directors, that\'s all I can hope for. Right now, I feel the most solid and my work is the best it\'s ever been. I feel fortunate.      (On Public Enemies (2009)) Public Enemies was a six-month shoot. I love Michael (Mann), but I don\'t know. We shot that movie for a long time, and when you see the movie, there\'s a lot of parts I like in it, but there are so many characters. I was like, ""Where did it all go?"" I didn\'t even know where Johnny\'s character was, and he was Dillinger. I loved the gun-battle scenes, I loved the look of the film, but I kind of lost my character in there, and I was, ""Oh-kay, that was half a year"" ... But I love Michael Mann. I was going through a tough time when he offered me that movie. I didn\'t think I could do the movie because I was losing my mom - she hadn\'t left me yet, but it was headed that way...      (2010) I pretty much lived movie to movie in my younger years because I loved spending money and I didn\'t really have a concept of ""assets,"" but as I got a little older, I bought art. I got all these cool pictures - a Warhol painting, a Basquiat drawing, a little Keith Haring - every time I had a little extra money. But for a while there, I was just living movie to movie. ""Oh, I need a job? All right, what\'s out there? Okay, I\'ll take that one.""      (2010) I do credit my mom and my dad that even in my more rebellious years, I didn\'t cross the line. There was never an E! True Hollywood Story about me, I never got arrested. Yeah, I partied, and went a little crazy with the girls and had my drinking days, but I never got addicted to hard-core drugs, and I really do believe it\'s because I was lucky enough to have a family that really guarded me in a city like this.      (2011) When I lost my mom, my whole life changed. It changed the way I thought about everything, about how I woke up every morning.      My dad is Jewish so I was kinda brought up half-Jewish.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nNatascha McElhone ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 26 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(11)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(10)  Overview (3)Date of Birth14\xa0December1969,\xa0Surrey, England, UK Birth NameNatasha Abigail TaylorHeight5\'\xa08""\xa0(1.73\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Natascha McElhone was born in Walton on Thames, London.

[January 2013]Personal Quotes (10)      I wanted to know whether the character was going to be \'the wife\' or \'the girlfriend\', which bores me to tears and is endemic. I think it\'s incumbent on actresses to bring something else to the part which isn\'t in the script.      I think I was ambitious. I still am. A lot of the stuff that was coming my way was stuff I just didn\'t want to do, so it might have seemed like lack of ambition to shy away from that, but if it sticks in your throat... I just wanted to do what I wanted to do and which I thought said something.      Now I\'m the sole breadwinner... I have to work. I have to try and work non-stop, actually, to make things work.      I always keep myself busy. I\'m writing. Or I\'m creating something. Or I\'m doing stuff with the kids. I\'m up incredibly early in the morning; I go to bed incredibly late at night.      Somebody said something wonderful to me the other day, Martin\'s best mate, he said, \'But Tash, you talk about status quo, there is no such thing as status quo, things change all the time, and if this hasn\'t taught you that...      Extraordinary things have come about since Martin\'s death. And I don\'t know if that\'s to compensate... it\'s also an attitude, it\'s how you look at things. It\'s a choice how you perceive the events of your life.      I think the difference between finding happiness, or moments of happiness, is how you choose to interpret things. That\'s a rather shocking responsibility. That we\'re responsible for our own happiness. It\'s not those around us.      My kids are still flourishing, it\'s remarkable to me. And growing and learning more and more. I did think that if perhaps the roots of the tree were gone, the branches would no longer flower, but they are. That\'s remarkable.      I think TV, I think right now, and I speak for many shows. Not just our show. That TVs now in it\'s zenith. It\'s how the 70s were for movies-the 2000\'s are for TV. I think it\'s a phenomenal time for TV and to be involved in it. And I, as you know, this show slightly preempted me that curve, but God am I glad that it worked out that way. Because I really, I didn\'t have much experience with TV. I had mostly done movies and some plays. So I was very lucky to end up in a show that was not only successful, but was sort of groundbreaking in its own way, or at least it pushed some boundaries!      [on \'""Californication"" (2007)\'] David (Duchovny) always said the thing that drew him to the story originally was this idea that a couple met and they had \'it.\' They had that thing, they had the spark. They were in love. And they lost it, destroyed it, and then tried to get it back. And couldn\'t. That maybe you don\'t get a second chance.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nStephen Rea ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 15 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(7)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(3)  Overview (3)Date of Birth31\xa0October1946,\xa0Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK Birth NameGraham ReaHeight5\'\xa010Â½""\xa0(1.79\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Stephen Rea was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

His entrance was just as dramatic as some of his roles. On the evening of his birth Udo\'s mother requested extra time with her new baby. The nurses had gathered all of the other babies and returned them to the nursery when the hospital was bombed. He and his mother were rescued from underneath the rubble. Udo didn\'t know much about his father. When Udo was 18 he moved to Britain in order to learn the English language. While there he took a few acting courses. He was eventually offered a role by director Michael Sarne as a gigolo in the film Road to Saint Tropez (1966). While the role was small, it was the beginning of his career in films. His first ""hit"" film was Hexen bis aufs Blut gequÃ¤lt (1970) (Mark of the Devil). The film was rated ""V"" for violence and ticket buyers were offered vomit bags before the film started. It was banned in 31 countries but spawned two sequels (both without Kier). The film is notorious for its exploitation of sex and violence (the uncut version was remastered and re-released on video in 1997).Kier met director Paul Morrissey on an airplane trip. Morrissey offered him the lead role in the 3-D Flesh for Frankenstein (1973). It was this film, along with its sister film Blood for Dracula (1974), that made Udo a cult figure. Both Morrissey films are also known as Andy Warhol\'s Frankenstein and Dracula; however, Andy Warhol was not involved in the production or creation of the films. Both were rated X when released. One of Kier\'s most vivid memories from ""Flesh for Frankenstein"" was the infamous ""internal organ"" scene. Real animal organs were used that were left unrefrigerated on the set for several hours. Udo had to pull the organs out of a prop dummy with his bare hands and hold them up to his face. He has said he will never forget that smell. When this film was finished the cast and crew began immediately filming ""Blood for Dracula"". Udo remembers both of these films fondly and regards ""Dracula"" over ""Frankenstein"" as his favorite of the two (in 1996 both films were released by Criterion on DVD totally uncut).In the 1970s some of Kier\'s work included The Salzburg Connection (1972), Histoire d\'O (1975) (The Story of O), Spermula (1976) and ExposÃ© (1976) (House on Straw Hill). Much of his work has been dubbed with someone else\'s voice. In Suspiria (1977) there were some technical difficulties with the sound while his scene was shot. In the 1980s some of his work included Lulu (1980), Docteur Jekyll et les femmes (1981) (The Blood of Dr Jekyll), Die Insel der blutigen Plantage (1983) (Escape from Blood Plantation) and VerfÃ¼hrung: Die grausame Frau (1985) (Seduction: The Cruel Woman). In the 1980s Kier did very little work outside of Europe. In the 1990s he had a lot more visibility in America and his breakthrough role was as Hans in My Own Private Idaho (1991) (the soundtrack includes the song that Udo performs in the film). Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993) reunited Kier with his friend Keanu Reeves yet again. Udo was cast as Pamela Anderson\'s sidekick in Barb Wire (1996) and played Ron Camp in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994) opposite Jim Carrey. In the 1990s some of the films he was in included Riget (1994), For Love or Money (1993), Breaking the Waves (1996), The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996), Blade (1998) and Armageddon (1998).Over his 30-year career Udo has worked with several brilliant directors: Paul Morrissey, Charles Matton, Dario Argento, Gus Van Sant and Walerian Borowczyk. he continues to work often with Lars von Trier and is the godfather of Van Trier\'s child as well as a good friend. Von Trier is currently working on a film entitled Dimension which is a project that spans 30 years. Every year the cast and crew (including Udo) meet to shoot footage. The film will show the actors age 30 years without make-up or special effects. Approximately seen years of footage has already been shot. The premiere will take place in 2024! Kier\'s acting career ranges from art house films (Europa (1991)) to gore fests (Das deutsche KettensÃ¤gen Massaker (1990) (German Chainsaw Massacre)) to television commercials. He says he loves horror films and wants to do more of them. He enjoys playing villains, as he feels it is more interesting because evil has no limits. Currently Udo lives in California and spends much of his time working in Europe, where he receives larger roles and more recognition.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       <BloodyOlga@hotmail.com>          Trade Mark (4)        Frequently portrays a vampire character        Piercing blue eyes        Often plays leading or secondary villains that ends up in horrible death        Eccentric characters and personaTrivia (6)      Loves horror movies, and has a particular fondness for playing vampire characters.

E. R.      He also sings.      Can speak at least three languages, including German, English and Danish.Personal Quotes (6)      I think to be the devil you have to be angel. Only an angel can play the devil because the devil was a fallen angel.      Audition is the worst thing. It\'s like cleaning furniture in a department store.Werner Herzog, I knew him for so many years, when [Rainer Werner Fassbinder] was at his highest moment. But we had a rule: An actor from Fassbinder could never work with an actor of Werner Herzog or Wim Wenders. Because if we would have done that, we would have been spies. AAh, you worked with Werner - how was it? How did he direct you? I was Fassbinder\'s actor.      (2010, on My Own Private Idaho) I was in Berlin, and I saw a film by the name of Mala Noche. And I thought ""Wow. Wow, wow, wow. How independent can you get?"" Then I went to a party and I met Gus Van Sant. He came to me and he said, ""You know, you are one of my favorite actors. I\'m making a movie with River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves, and I would like that you play, if you like, Hans."" Of course, if you\'re German, your name in films is always Hans. Simple. If you make a film in Japan, your name is Hans-man. I thought, ""Ah, I like him."" Very intelligent man... So I said, ""Okay. Here\'s my address."" A couple of weeks later, I got- this was not the time of e-mail, and not even faxes. So he sent me the script, I read the script, and I was scared, I was so scared, thinking, ""I have to go to bed with Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix?"" My friends back in Germany said, ""Fuck you! They are teenage idols in America! Every American actor would love to be able to do that!"" Then I wrote Gus back. I love Gus, because he\'s the one who got me my work permit, and he\'s the reason that I\'m living in America... So it was very funny, and I said, ""Okay, I\'m coming."" I wrote him saying, ""I just found a suitcase at a flea market, and Hans should have a suitcase."" I brought all my clothes, and I said to him, ""Hans should be always dressed very high, should cover his body,"" because I knew I had to be naked to have sex with Keanu Reeves. Amazing to have sex with Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix! So I came to Idaho, and I was sitting in a restaurant with Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix, and Gus introduced me, and River was amazing. He said, ""Hans, sit next to me!"" And Keanu didn\'t understand anything. Anyway, to make the story short, I made the film and I had a great time.      (2010) Shadow of the Vampire was a film we shot in Luxembourg with Willem Dafoe, and Malkovich playing Murnau, and I played the producer, Albin Grau. It was with Eddie Izzard, some very interesting British actors in it. Personally, I\'m not an ensemble actor, because it\'s always a lot of ego when you\'re all together in the scene. It\'s kind of intellectual fighting for something. But it was very good, and I was only jealous that I didn\'t play the vampire, Nosferatu, which Willem Dafoe played, and he was nominated for the Oscar for his performance, which was an amazing performance. But the actor\'s always as good as the stories are. And so many important things, there is the light, there is the costumes, the makeup, there\'s the text, there\'s so many elements which the actor himself cannot control. But the script is the most important thing. First of all the story, and then you go from there. You know, it\'s like you stand in the kitchen, and say are we making a fish or do we grill a steak? And you go from there... Shadow Of The Vampire was an okay film. You never know. I made so many films I thought were great and they turned out horrible, and I made films I did not believe in at all, and Shadow of the Vampire was one of these films I did not believe in during the shooting. And then when I saw it I was surprised what they had made out of it. They edited for quite a long time. I like Willem. I did with Willem Manderlay, and I did with Willem My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done, last year, a David Lynch production. And he\'s a wonderful actor, a good actor and a wonderful person.      (2010, on Barb Wire) So I got a call, and they said, ""Would you be interested in making a movie with Pamela Anderson?"" I said, ""Of cou-u-urse! Any time!"" So the first day of shooting I knocked at her trailer-which was enormous, as big as her breasts. So I knock and I hear from inside: ""Hello? Come in!"" So I stepped in the trailer and she was at least 25 feet away from me. So I went there and took both hands around her waist, which was like a transvestite, so small, and I said, ""Wow! How amazing!"" And I kissed her. When I touched her, all the producers, they fly to the wall because they thought she was going to hit me, and thinking, ""How horrible! That foreign, German piece of shit is coming in my trailer!"" And she loved it. I stepped out of the trailer, and the assistant was there and I said, ""Send her 50 roses from me."" Then we became friends, and I went to the director and I said, ""I don\'t want too many directions on how to act with her. Can I just smell her in the film? Doesn\'t matter how far from me, let me just go like [sniffs deeply]."" I smell her from far or from close. That was for me the only direction I could think of, because I could never be stronger than the biggest sex symbol of America. So I had to think of something... We had a beautiful scene. When the director asked me to be in the film, I said, ""Okay, I\'m going to shave my hair!"" He said, ""Would you really do that?"" I said ""Yeah!"" I had so much hair, it\'s ridiculous. So I shaved my hair and the film started and I had a wig on, and she took two fingers and took my wig and said, ""Curly, I don\'t think so!"" And she swung my wig away. And that was our opening, which was amazing! There are certain people who I worked with, Pamela Anderson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, they are figures. And they know this. They don\'t pretend to be good actors.

'Feardotcom' was filmed in Luxembourg (apparently standing in for New
York, I think.) and hasn't been officially released yet. I saw it as
one of the featured films during the Luxembourg International Film
festival. (Cinenygma) - One of the executive producers, who introduced
the film, said it wasn't 100% finished yet, and that even the title
might change. However, since every second of the film was even more
tortuous than the depravities depicted on the screen, I believe no
amount of focus groups or editing could save this film. I'd say
'straight to video', but that would be a major waste of plastic and
cardboard. I suppose if they market it as a parody, they might salvage
the cost of, um, the catering during the film.<br><br>Stephen Dorff plays a hard-boiled detective who's haunted by that one
case that was never solved. You know he's haunted because he walks
around with a 3 day growth of beard. Which stays at the same length the
whole film, even though the film covers quite a few days (it was hard
tell, nothing was very coherent) And guess what! His old nemesis from
the unsolved case is killing again! Oh boy! And since we now have new
cases to solve, AND they're dying from what looks to be a virus, we
need to bring in the woman scientist and nominal love interest
(Natascha McElhone - who displayed quite amply in 'The Truman Show'
that she can't act. She must work cheap, or maybe they needed someone
to make Dorff look good.) We know she's a scientist because she wears
glasses. And just for grins we get Jeffrey Coombs as Dorff's partner,
whose main role appears to be running around spouting non-sequiturs.
Speaking of which, there was a writer listed for the film but I'd bet a
Ben Franklin that they were making up the dialog as they went along,
and probably for a different film. It's too bad 'Deep Space 9' went off
the air - it might have prevented Coombs from getting caught up in this
travesty. And there's Stephen Rea as the mad scientist, looking vaguely
like Geoffrey Rush mad scientist character in 'Mystery Men.' Now, I
could have sworn Rea could act, so maybe they are two of them?
Amazingly a director is also listed, but from what I can tell they
pretty much turned on the camera, came back later, took the film to the
editing room, forgot to turn on the lights and just started editing.
That would explain a lot.<br><br>And what of the plot? Ha! There isn't one! Well, OK, maybe a little
one. I think the deal was that the girl killed in the unsolved case
somehow inhabited the internet and is killing people if they log on to
the mad scientist's site, where HE tortures women until they beg him to
kill them - and all for $9.95! (but just for grins they (the
unfortunates who log into fear.com) only die after 48 hours, because, I
think, that's how long it took her to be killed) But I think you'd need
a broadband connection, because somehow when you login, this girl
living in the internet puts a hex on you, which involves you falling
off your chair and eventually trashing your apartment and nose bleeds,
and um, dying from the fright of your worst fear (like being cast in
this movie) and I really don't think that could happen with a dial up
connection. Um, anyway, she's going to keep on killing people unless
the mad scientist is caught. And her body is found too. I mean they
threw that bit in there about finding the body, but then when it was
found, it didn't count for anything! Now, doesn't that just bite. Damn
fickle internet ghosts.<br><br>**SPOILER**<br><br>Actually this whole film was a spoiler, at least it smelled spoiled to
me. Anyway - the final scene where Dorff and the McElhone rush into the
mad scientist's lair (located in an abandoned steel mill or nuclear
plant - the film couldn't make up it's mind what it was - it identified
it as both during different scenes in the film) and stop him only
seconds before he's going to kill his latest victim had me rolling in
the aisle with laughter. It was just like watching an old horror film
from the 30's or 40's. Maniacal laughter, bug-eyed expressions of
madness, flashing lights, tilted camera angles. So they manage to save
the girl, but then the mad scientist shoots Dorff, and then stabs
McElhone then Dorff grabs a keyboard and logs into feardot.com which
drives the mad scientist so mad - he dies from fear! Then Dorff dies,
and McElhone, who was in love with Dorff (oh, did I leave that part
out? - apparently they fell madly in love in some 30 second scene
earlier in the film - some real in-depth character development going on
here.) sort of cries over his body, but um, somehow she's no longer
stabbed! Maybe it was her Multi-vitamin.<br><br>**END OF SPOILER**<br><br>So -um, in conclusion - I can't imagine any changes to this film
possibly making it watchable. I'll be surprised if gets released at all
(though the executive producer said Warner Bros had picked it up for US
distribution, and Columbia-Tri-Star for the rest of the world. Let's
hope they come to their senses.) You have been warned. Go watch 'Donnie
Darko' instead!

I've seen my fair share of bad movies. But I can honestly say that this
is in my top 3 worst movies. Usually, when I see an extremely bad film,
it's so awful that it's funny - which makes it somewhat entertaining.
But this film went into another and far worse category. A film so awful
that I got a headache - not because the plot was so complex and
intelligent, but because the plot was so ridiculous and unrealistic. <br><br>It's simple: when you go in search of a killer, call for backup. Don't
go alone into an empty building. Have some common sense! Unfortunatelt,
all the characters in FeardotCom, seem to have been born without the
common sense gene. <br><br>I could suffer through dozens of cheesy horror flicks where the victim
getting chased by a killer conveniently trips and falls down while the
killer get increasingly closer. . . I could even suffer through poor
acting in a horror flick if the plot is entertaining and at least
scary. <br><br>But, when the plot of a film is neither logical nor entertaining you
get one movie: FeardotCom

I do not really remember how I came upon this movie, but I do know that
somewhere along the way it has made it's way into my DVD collection. I
do not know if I blindly bought it, was given it as a ""gift"", or if
someone lent it to me and I just forgot to return it, but whatever way,
it is in there now. I watched it quite some time ago, expecting it to
be decent enough, entertaining at least, because I really liked the
tagline and the premise seemed fun, though I have learned to stay away
from a lot of ""technology killing"" horrors over the past few years now,
and I remembered before I watched it again recently that I hated it the
first time I watched it, a lot, and it was very negatively reviewed as
well. Watching it again confirmed my feelings.<br><br>The film itself is just entirely ridiculous and absurd from beginning
to end with a horrible storyline and lame performances and ""thrills"".
There is zero to none interesting scenes that make the viewer feel
creeped out or enticed in any way, and the whole film is a joke within
itself. I especially hated the ludicrous characters and twists, and
also the way the story was executed in a poor manner, not being able to
stay with one main idea for too long that it is infuriatingly annoying
to watch the plot, what plot there is at least, unfold. The movie
resembles a little diddy of a film titled ""Ringu/The Ring"" an awful
lot, though both of those renditions are spectacular and this pales
entirely in comparison, and even though there are some nice settings in
this movie, that is really and truly the only plus side to it.<br><br>There are many noticeable errors and plot holes, the dialogue is, for
our inconvenience, not as laughable as one would hope, but corny enough
to get a few giggles now and then, especially some of the deliverances
from the female lead, and the climax/ending is not anywhere near
heartracing or interest sparking, just bland and hardly tolerable.
There are many useless scenes of violence that have no importance
whatsoever except to try and get a rise in the viewer, which was not
accomplished in my situation, and a lot of material is just thrown in
there randomly, which goes back to how I stated it is poorly executed
and extremely mediocre. My summary pretty much warns anyone and
everyone away from this movie, unless you are a masochist and want to
be put through this pain.

I would estimate that I've seen over a thousand movies in my lifetime.
FeardotCom may very well be the worst of those films. The acting is
bad, the dialogue is worse, and the editing is terrible. The film lacks
coherence, cohesiveness, and, in some parts, comprehensiveness. The
film manages to maintain its unwatchability for over an hour, but by
that point the viewer will probably have already logged onto
www.feardotcom.com in hopes of ending the misery. If I had been able to
give this movie less than a star, I would have done so in a heartbeat.
Do not make the mistake of renting this movie; there's a small chance
it may scare you, but the odds of that happening are not worth sitting
through 90 minutes of some of the worst examples of film-making.

SPOILER FREE COMMENT! (though I don't think that there's anything to
spoil here...) <br><br>I really don't know, how could I force myself not to turn this movie
off after the first 20 minutes or so. In the first 1-2 minutes, I was
hopeful, i thought, that it can't be a bad movie, because it has Udo
Kier in it! My god, how wrong I was...<br><br>When the movie reached the 20 minutes mark, I was so desperate, that
I've never been in my life. By then, it was pretty obvious, that this
is a bad movie. It wasn't like that, when a movie seems good at the
start but goes downhill later; no. It was bad from the beginning to the
end.<br><br>There is no story. There is no acting. There is no direction.
Character-development? Did you see any characters in this movie? Or can
I even write down the word ""movie"" regarding this cinematic torture? I
think, not. I won't. Moreover, I won't write anything more about this
awful piece of film-making (Hmm... where did I see film-making in this?
I really need to stop writing this comment, before I write some more
ridiculous stuff. ""Filmmaking"", holy jeez...).<br><br>IMDb's lowest rating is ""awful"". This word hardly represents the
suffering you go through watching FearDotCom. This is the only movie I
rated 1 on this site, and when the credits started rolling, I
immediately put this movie into the AAAC-category. What does AAAC mean? <br><br>AVOID AT ALL COST!!! <br><br>1/10

Ok, so my boyfriend and I were going to go see this while it was in the
theaters but we never quite made it (Perhaps it was a divine stroke of
luck). So we rented the DVD from a video store. We were delayed from seeing
it yet again (you'd think we would've taken the hint) and left the DVD disc
at my house. After getting down to watching the movie, I was excited and
ready to be scared. We'd watched The Ring a few nights ago and it easily
gave me nightmares. But despite our hopes that this movie would do the same
job, we were sorely let down.<br><br> The movie had a strong start even if it was confusing. A man is hit by a
subway train when he sees a little girl on the tracks. Why did he jump back
out in front of the train? Then you meet the male lead and his associate in
the police department. Why do they both sound like the stupidest cops you'll
ever see? The female lead knew more about policing than the both of them.
Most of the other actors sounded like they were reading off cue cards and
the plot quickly because unbeliveable (ah yes, I'll let my sick daughter
play in an old steel mill even if she's supposively afraid of sharp things
and on top of that, how did Terry know to listen to the half blind old lady
in the mill? and let's not forget, to get to the site, its ""feardotcom.com""
not ""fear.com."" the doctor got ripped off on his site) By this point in the
movie I begged my boyfriend to let it keep playing just to see if it saved
itself. It didn't. The ending was cliche', and the special effects when they
killed the doctor were the only positive things in the movie. The basic
story for FearDotCom was a creative one...but poorly executed (no pun
intended). Save yourself a rental and go see something else. You'll thank
yourself later.

About halfway through the movie, I was actually considering giving this a 4,
but the complete and utter lack of reasoning in this movie that made me give
it a 1 I will now try to sum up.<br><br>The ghost made a website that people can log (and start hallucinating from)
onto only 48 hours later they will be dead unless they find her body so she
can exact revenge on someone who killed her on another website that people
subscribe to, even though she kills other people in car crashes and train
accidents who had no involvement with her death.<br><br>Things I learned from FearDotCom:<br><br>-Ghosts are capable of creating websites.<br><br>-The internet is inherently evil.<br><br>-People who use the internet are freaks.<br><br>-People who use the internet are incapable of closing their
eyes.<br><br>-A bunch of weird images on a computer can drive someone crazy and make them
hallucinate.<br><br>-A bunch of weird images on a movie can drive someone so crazy that they
hallucinate so they think what they are watching makes one ounce of logical
sense.<br><br>Obviously the producers of this movie wanted the audience to be driven
insane by the film and have shut off our brains by the time the ""ending"" has
arrived. Sadly, I was still conscious at the end which didn't explain
anything and only dropped my score from a 4 to a 1.<br><br>And it's a very boring movie too. Did I mention this movie
sucks?

I admit, I wanted to see this movie.  I expected it to be decent, as it was
from the same people who made House On Haunted Hill.  What I didn't expect
was for it to be so bad.<br><br>1. What was up with the lighting?  Did they spend the entire budget on the
website graphics and not have enough left over for electricity?<br><br>2.  How many times can one movie reuse special effects from House On
Haunted
Hill?  The ""ghosts"" walking around and having a seizure?  The ""ghost"" at
the
end looked so much like the ""shadow"" from HOHH that I was waiting for Famke
Janssen to pop out of it looking for Geoffrey Rush.  The even ripped off
the
gory statues that could be found in the foyer to the basement in HOHH.<br><br>3.  How did the main characters fall in love after meeting for two seconds?
They had very little chemistry together.  Which is probably due to the fact
that Natascha McElhone CAN'T ACT!<br><br>4.  The website issue and Denise the ghost woman were never really tied
together that well either.  AND, while we're on the subject of little Miss
Ghost Denise, what mother would let her hemopheliac 8 year old walk 2 miles
down the street to play in an old abandoned steel mill?<br><br>With a running time of 98 minutes that felt like 3 hours, by the end of
feardotcom I had laughed so much that I really didn't care how it ended.  I
only wish that McElhone hadn't survived either, because the last part of
the
movie, the epilogue of her answering the phone and it being just static
made
no sense either.<br><br>Thank God they showed a preview for Ghost Ship!

If you even think about going to see the ""horror masterpiece"" Feardotcom,
I
urge you to take off your shoes, stay at home and stare at the wall. You
will be much more entertained. Trust me.<br><br>The directors and producers forgot about several things. First being a
decent script. The second, having quality actors. Third, estabishing mood
lighting for a 'scary movie' instead of having everything take place in a
dark room or two.<br><br>Part of the movie takes place via digital cameras. It worked for The Blair
Witch Project. It kinda worked for Halloween 8. It did not work here.<br><br>William Malone, the director, favored CGI over story telling. Too many of
the ""scares"" were laughable, too many of the scenes pointless.The only
saving grace for my $5.50 was the trailer for ""Ghost Ship"" before the
movie.<br><br>The lead actress, Natascha McElhone,looks like a cross between Crystal
Gayle

bad.<br><br>Stephen Dorff emotes like a wood board. Only one expression for fear,

After reading the description for this video and deciding to purchase
it two days ago, I felt that it might be a worthy horror film.
Unfortunately this movie was a major disappointment. This was
definitely a ""hack and slash"" film, but it was the plot and continuity
of the film that were cut to pieces. This movie had no redeeming
qualities... The plot was non-existent, the acting was poor, the
effects were poor... The worst part of all is that this movie was
actually released and that there are people that like it. No offense to
these folks, but when the best part of the movie is throwing it in the
trash, you really need to reconsider what you're watching. This could
have been a decent horror film, but all things considered, this movie
ranks a 1 on the rating scale and a 10 on the pain scale.<br><br>My suggestion is to watch a horror film such as 'The Ring' or John
Carpenter's 'The Thing.' Both are edge-of-your-seat thrillers that will
show you what horror is meant to be... ;)

through 90 minutes of some of the worst examples of film-making.

SPOILER FREE COMMENT! (though I don't think that there's anything to
spoil here...) <br><br>I really don't know, how could I force myself not to turn this movie
off after the first 20 minutes or so. In the first 1-2 minutes, I was
hopeful, i thought, that it can't be a bad movie, because it has Udo
Kier in it! My god, how wrong I was...<br><br>When the movie reached the 20 minutes mark, I was so desperate, that
I've never been in my life. By then, it was pretty obvious, that this
is a bad movie. It wasn't like that, when a movie seems good at the
start but goes downhill later; no. It was bad from the beginning to the
end.<br><br>There is no story. There is no acting. There is no direction.
Character-development? Did you see any characters in this movie? Or can
I even write down the word ""movie"" regarding this cinematic torture? I
think, not. I won't. Moreover, I won't write anything more about this
awful piece of film-making (Hmm... where did I see film-making in this?
I really need to stop writing this comment, before I write some more
ridiculous stuff. ""Filmmaking"", holy jeez...).<br><br>IMDb's lowest rating is ""awful"". This word hardly represents the
suffering you go through watching FearDotCom. This is the only movie I
rated 1 on this site, and when the credits started rolling, I
immediately put this movie into the AAAC-category. What does AAAC mean? <br><br>AVOID AT ALL COST!!! <br><br>1/10

Ok, so my boyfriend and I were going to go see this while it was in the
theaters but we never quite made it (Perhaps it was a divine stroke of
luck). So we rented the DVD from a video store. We were delayed from seeing
it yet again (you'd think we would've taken the hint) and left the DVD disc
at my house. After getting down to watching the movie, I was excited and
ready to be scared. We'd watched The Ring a few nights ago and it easily
gave me nightmares. But despite our hopes that this movie would do the same
job, we were sorely let down.<br><br> The movie had a strong start even if it was confusing. A man is hit by a
subway train when he sees a little girl on the tracks. Why did he jump back
out in front of the train? Then you meet the male lead and his associate in
the police department. Why do they both sound like the stupidest cops you'll
ever see? The female lead knew more about policing than the both of them.
Most of the other actors sounded like they were reading off cue cards and
the plot quickly because unbeliveable (ah yes, I'll let my sick daughter
play in an old steel mill even if she's supposively afraid of sharp things
and on top of that, how did Terry know to listen to the half blind old lady
in the mill? and let's not forget, to get to the site, its ""feardotcom.com""
not ""fear.com."" the doctor got ripped off on his site) By this point in the
movie I begged my boyfriend to let it keep playing just to see if it saved
itself. It didn't. The ending was cliche', and the special effects when they
killed the doctor were the only positive things in the movie. The basic
story for FearDotCom was a creative one...but poorly executed (no pun
intended). Save yourself a rental and go see something else. You'll thank
yourself later.

About halfway through the movie, I was actually considering giving this a 4,
but the complete and utter lack of reasoning in this movie that made me give
it a 1 I will now try to sum up.<br><br>The ghost made a website that people can log (and start hallucinating from)
onto only 48 hours later they will be dead unless they find her body so she
can exact revenge on someone who killed her on another website that people
subscribe to, even though she kills other people in car crashes and train
accidents who had no involvement with her death.<br><br>Things I learned from FearDotCom:<br><br>-Ghosts are capable of creating websites.<br><br>-The internet is inherently evil.<br><br>-People who use the internet are freaks.<br><br>-People who use the internet are incapable of closing their
eyes.<br><br>-A bunch of weird images on a computer can drive someone crazy and make them
hallucinate.<br><br>-A bunch of weird images on a movie can drive someone so crazy that they
hallucinate so they think what they are watching makes one ounce of logical
sense.<br><br>Obviously the producers of this movie wanted the audience to be driven
insane by the film and have shut off our brains by the time the ""ending"" has
arrived. Sadly, I was still conscious at the end which didn't explain
anything and only dropped my score from a 4 to a 1.<br><br>And it's a very boring movie too. Did I mention this movie
sucks?

I admit, I wanted to see this movie.  I expected it to be decent, as it was
from the same people who made House On Haunted Hill.  What I didn't expect
was for it to be so bad.<br><br>1. What was up with the lighting?  Did they spend the entire budget on the
website graphics and not have enough left over for electricity?<br><br>2.  How many times can one movie reuse special effects from House On
Haunted
Hill?  The ""ghosts"" walking around and having a seizure?  The ""ghost"" at
the
end looked so much like the ""shadow"" from HOHH that I was waiting for Famke
Janssen to pop out of it looking for Geoffrey Rush.  The even ripped off
the
gory statues that could be found in the foyer to the basement in HOHH.<br><br>3.  How did the main characters fall in love after meeting for two seconds?
They had very little chemistry together.  Which is probably due to the fact
that Natascha McElhone CAN'T ACT!<br><br>4.  The website issue and Denise the ghost woman were never really tied
together that well either.  AND, while we're on the subject of little Miss
Ghost Denise, what mother would let her hemopheliac 8 year old walk 2 miles
down the street to play in an old abandoned steel mill?<br><br>With a running time of 98 minutes that felt like 3 hours, by the end of
feardotcom I had laughed so much that I really didn't care how it ended.  I
only wish that McElhone hadn't survived either, because the last part of
the
movie, the epilogue of her answering the phone and it being just static
made
no sense either.<br><br>Thank God they showed a preview for Ghost Ship!

If you even think about going to see the ""horror masterpiece"" Feardotcom,
I
urge you to take off your shoes, stay at home and stare at the wall. You
will be much more entertained. Trust me.<br><br>The directors and producers forgot about several things. First being a
decent script. The second, having quality actors. Third, estabishing mood
lighting for a 'scary movie' instead of having everything take place in a
dark room or two.<br><br>Part of the movie takes place via digital cameras. It worked for The Blair
Witch Project. It kinda worked for Halloween 8. It did not work here.<br><br>William Malone, the director, favored CGI over story telling. Too many of
the ""scares"" were laughable, too many of the scenes pointless.The only
saving grace for my $5.50 was the trailer for ""Ghost Ship"" before the
movie.<br><br>The lead actress, Natascha McElhone,looks like a cross between Crystal
Gayle
and Meryl Streep, with the acting ablitiy of Tawny Kitaen. She's just that
bad.<br><br>Stephen Dorff emotes like a wood board. Only one expression for fear,
confusion, and insanity.<br><br>Please, I urge you to say home and stare at the wall. Save your money. You

After reading the description for this video and deciding to purchase
it two days ago, I felt that it might be a worthy horror film.
Unfortunately this movie was a major disappointment. This was
definitely a ""hack and slash"" film, but it was the plot and continuity
of the film that were cut to pieces. This movie had no redeeming
qualities... The plot was non-existent, the acting was poor, the
effects were poor... The worst part of all is that this movie was
actually released and that there are people that like it. No offense to
these folks, but when the best part of the movie is throwing it in the
trash, you really need to reconsider what you're watching. This could
have been a decent horror film, but all things considered, this movie
ranks a 1 on the rating scale and a 10 on the pain scale.<br><br>My suggestion is to watch a horror film such as 'The Ring' or John
Carpenter's 'The Thing.' Both are edge-of-your-seat thrillers that will
show you what horror is meant to be... ;)

                    A French foreign-exchange student comes to a small Texas high school, befriends a classmate, and practically takes over her life.
            ","

A French foreign exchange student, named Genevieve, comes to a small town in Texas to attend a local high school where she shacks up with the school's popular head cheerleader, Starla, and her parents. But Starla soon learns that this French girl is not only smart, attractive, and naive, but quite conniving when Geneviere, with no social life of her own, begins to take over Starla's, starting with stealing the affections her parents, her friends and Starla's boyfriend. When Starla is forced to quit the cheerleading squad after getting some bad grads, Genevieve moves in to take her place. When Starla figures out that Genevieve deliberately set it up by giving her bad tutoring to fail all those classes, she begins an all-out personal war against Genevieve to take back her social life. But Genevieve is anticipating exactly that type of response from Starla and soon turns everyone, including Starla's friends and family, against her by playing the poor victim and making it appear that ...

I remember seeing the trailer for this movie a few years ago and
wanting to see it. It was originally supposed to come out in the summer
of 2002, but ended up sitting on the shelf for a while. A few months
ago, I caught it on the ABC Family Channel under the title SHE GETS
WHAT SHE WANTS. While SLAP HER...SHE'S FRENCH is a much better title, I
can see why it was changed. I guess it's not very PC, but then again,
the movie itself isn't very PC, which is one of the reasons I liked it.
It wasn't afraid to be a bit edgy. In addition to being edgy, the film
is also quite over-the-top at times. While some may be bothered by the
over-the-top scenes, I enjoyed them. They fit in well with the tone of
the picture.<br><br>This is the the kind of movie MEAN GIRLS wanted to be. When one thinks
about it, it's somewhat unfair that MEAN GIRLS got a theatrical release
while this went straight-to-television since this is far superior. It's
far better than most teen comedies that have come out in the past few
years. **1/2

Many of the negative reviews of this film are obviously written by
francophiles who have had their feathers ruffled by the original title
and apparently haven't actually seen the movie. Slap her She's French
makes fun of generically American and more specifically Texan culture,
FAR more than the French. I was delighted(and surprised)to find this a
very well acted and cleverly written teen comedy that provided a
vehicle for showcasing the talents of a number of young actresses. The
film does stereotype and titillate but it is a teen comedy and they
tend to do that. Those who are offended by such things should consider
therapy to get over themselves or simply avoid this genre. Personally I
was too busy laughing to be bothered.

I don't think that this movie has aspirations to greatness, but it was
enjoyable enough, and has some very good performances.<br><br>Top of the list for me was Jane McGregor. She really gave her all in
playing Starla who was, after all, not a particularly sympathetic
character. She has a real flair for comedy - at the tender age of 19 -
and is very attractive as well. I will be looking out for Jane's work
in future.<br><br>I also enjoyed the minor role from the little brother, not too
overdone, and the mother with the ever present ""iced tea"".<br><br>Overall, a pleasant diversion, fairly lightweight, but with some good
work from the cast.

Yes it might not be the best movie ever made, but for mindless
entertainment, this is a good movie. It made me laugh to see a high
school princess's world throw into a frenzy (no, I am not a cynic and
don't hate all high school princesses). I kinda liked it, and it kept
me awake at work. I am not suggesting going out and buying it; far from
it. But if you get a chance to catch it on TV, and are in the mood for
mindless entertainment, watch it. It tries to capitalize on the genre
of movies like ""Mean Girls"", ""Man of the House"", and ""Bring It On"". I
know that I might be clashing with some of your beliefs about this
movie, but your comments made this out a lot worse than it was, which
is just a funny teenage movie.

going in but I like teen comedies. I was pleasantly surprised, it
didn't blow me away but it also didn't suck. It was just in the middle
somewhere with decent acting, a so-so plot and some genuinely funny
lines.<br><br>Slap Her, She's French AKA She Gets What She Wants is the story of Uber
Popular girl Starla Grady. She dreams of being the next Diane Sawyer,
and is doing everything she can to get known. She wins at everything,
head cheerleader, beauty contests, the popular boyfriend and sets all
the trends at school. In order to beat out the competition at a beauty
contest Starla announces to her town that her family will be graciously
hosting a foreign exchange student from France. When Genevieve Le
Plouff arrives she seems like the perfect opportunity for Starla to
impress everyone. Slowly with some very sly moves Genevieve begins to
move her way into Starla's life and her position in the social ladder.
Starla begins to realize that Genevieve is purposely overtaking her and
it's working. With the help of a former adversary Starla will discover
a disturbing secret about the supposed French foreign exchange student
and give it her all to overcome her.<br><br>Lead actress Jane McGregor who plays Starla does a great job at being
the bitchy ""Clueless"" type girl, obsessed with only herself. Throughout
the course of the film she manages to learn a little about being a
little nicer but overall she keeps her character true to herself. She's
spoiled and kind of an anti hero but fun anyways. Piper Perabo does a
decent job at playing the faux Foreign exchange student even at 27
years old!! She plays wicked pretty well but never really gets down and
dirty which you kind of expect her character to get. Most of the comedy
is either physical comedy or one liners surrounding sexual comments and
mistaken English which is still pretty funny. The humor doesn't get
really dirty like some teen comedies go with. It's not a bad movie and
you won't necessarily be disappointed with it but it's mostly
forgettable offbeat and very low key. 6/10

OK, I'll go out on the limb here by stating that I really liked this
movie, and was pleasantly surprised by it. This flick simply does what
it says on the cover: a comedy that is actually funny, rather than
gross or grotesque. There is a real story, real development, a real
turn-around, real acting; the plot is funny, as are the quotes and
dialogues (""Our love dried up like a three day-old croissant!"") and the
running gags (such as the students adopting ""Ouais!"" as their
interjection-du-jour in an attempt to emulate GeneviÃ¨ve, or Starla's
alcoholic mum's fixation on her ""special"" ice tea); in fact, and
especially considering the movie's provenience and target audience, the
humour is often astoundingly dark. This is all the more laudable as
both cast and production are sort of B-listish (by fame, not
performance).<br><br>My only brickbat would be that I thought that Starla's magic conversion
from teenage queen-bee to ""real person"" with concomitant change of
boyfriend was predictable, moralistic, unnecessary and naff.

Like most people I groaned when I saw the trailer and, ahem, the title for
this movie.  But I rented the DVD on a whim and hey, turns out this is
pretty darn funny after all.<br><br>It's not subtle, but it is good fun, which is more than can be said for
other teen comedies from 2002.  The two leading ladies are genuine stars of

People are entitled to their opinions, but I can't quite grasp how this
has ended up with a measely 4.8 stars. This movie is actually good!
I'll be honest, when I saw the trailer in the cinema (it was given
theatrical release in Britain, I'm not sure about anywhere else!) I
though 'Oh, here we go, another brainless American sex-comedy.' This
isn't completely removed from the truth, but my first thought was
certainly very unfair. This is actually quite a smart movie. The plot
in a nutshell is as follows - Starla, the popular head cheerleader, has
her 'perfect' life picked apart by the conniving exchange student that,
ironically, Starla became involved with for her own selfish reasons. As
you might expect, mayhem ensues. Contrary to the title, there is very
little mockery of the French - no, all the mocking is aimed squarely at
American culture, particularly that of the 'popular' high school
student. This culture is lambasted, parodied and ripped to shreds at
every turn with hilarious effect - the Beef Pageant full of grinning,
dancing cowgirls; Starla's refusal to see the usefulness of learning a
foreign language; Karl Fuller, the meat-munching quarterback (no pun
intended) with a head full of steak, rather than brains; and of course
Starla's dippy acolyte friends who loudly demand of Genevieve 'Do you
speak American?' The characters are all wonderful and played
surprisingly well, considering none of them are massive 'names'. Jane
McGregor does a wonderful job of Starla, making her likable despite her
flaws. It's a shame McGregor is not really given more of a chance in
mainstream Hollywood as she played this role very well indeed. Perabo
is fine as Genevieve, bringing across a smug innocence even if her
accent is a little bit 'Music Hall', shall we say. Starla's family are
great - Brandon Smith is good as Starla's wholesome pursuits-type
father, and Julie White is really funny as Mrs Grady who is rarely seen
without her Thermos flask of Long Island Iced Tea. Jesse James is
brilliant as Starla's precocious little brother Randolph, and Starla's
trashy gal-pals are also played to a tee. One thing you can say about
this film is that it never glamorizes the stuff it pokes fun at. An
obvious comparison here is Mean Girls that came out 18 months or so
later - another sharp pastiche of teen culture and the stuff that goes
with it - but come on, be honest. In the aftermath of that movie, how
many girls did you know who suddenly wanted to become 'lip gloss
chicks'? Apparently, at my school, particularly in the new Sixth Form
(thank God I'd left by then!) there was a sudden surge of 'clique'
behavior, as well as some stupid, misguided girls who insisted on
calling themselves 'The Plastics.' This is why I think Slap Her... is
superior to Mean Girls, though I'd be stomped for saying it out loud. I
can't imagine anyone wanting to mirror shallow, selfish, oblivious
Starla; big-mouthed, stupid Tanner; or two-faced, spiteful Ashley. This
movie was so good at skewering the object of its main mockery it has
rendered its target as completely unappealing. Slap her...is a
surprisingly smart, comedic gem with an agenda, and deserves far more
recognition that it gets.

I saw this movie back in 2002 when it came out, luckily I went to the
cheap theater. Imagine my surprise when I saw a preview on ABC for a
new movie, the ""Premiere,"" they were saying. I watched the preview and
the more times I saw it the more I insisted to family and friends that
I had seen this film. They pointed out it was an ""ABC Family Original,""
and this was the premiere, no way could I have seen it. Raunchy
cheerleader moves, flippy hair, French student, girly cat fight, lots
of posturing in front of mirrors, yeah I've seen this movie. However,
ABC decided to get a little more PC (guess we're on better terms with
France,) and they changed the title to ""She Gets What She Wants.""

I remember seeing the trailer for this movie a few years ago and
wanting to see it. It was originally supposed to come out in the summer
of 2002, but ended up sitting on the shelf for a while. A few months
ago, I caught it on the ABC Family Channel under the title SHE GETS
WHAT SHE WANTS. While SLAP HER...SHE'S FRENCH is a much better title, I
can see why it was changed. I guess it's not very PC, but then again,
the movie itself isn't very PC, which is one of the reasons I liked it.
It wasn't afraid to be a bit edgy. In addition to being edgy, the film
is also quite over-the-top at times. While some may be bothered by the
over-the-top scenes, I enjoyed them. They fit in well with the tone of
the picture.<br><br>This is the the kind of movie MEAN GIRLS wanted to be. When one thinks
about it, it's somewhat unfair that MEAN GIRLS got a theatrical release
while this went straight-to-television since this is far superior. It's
far better than most teen comedies that have come out in the past few
years. **1/2

Many of the negative reviews of this film are obviously written by
francophiles who have had their feathers ruffled by the original title
and apparently haven't actually seen the movie. Slap her She's French
makes fun of generically American and more specifically Texan culture,
FAR more than the French. I was delighted(and surprised)to find this a
very well acted and cleverly written teen comedy that provided a
vehicle for showcasing the talents of a number of young actresses. The
film does stereotype and titillate but it is a teen comedy and they
tend to do that. Those who are offended by such things should consider
therapy to get over themselves or simply avoid this genre. Personally I
was too busy laughing to be bothered.

I don't think that this movie has aspirations to greatness, but it was
enjoyable enough, and has some very good performances.<br><br>Top of the list for me was Jane McGregor. She really gave her all in
playing Starla who was, after all, not a particularly sympathetic
character. She has a real flair for comedy - at the tender age of 19 -
and is very attractive as well. I will be looking out for Jane's work
in future.<br><br>I also enjoyed the minor role from the little brother, not too
overdone, and the mother with the ever present ""iced tea"".<br><br>Overall, a pleasant diversion, fairly lightweight, but with some good
work from the cast.

Yes it might not be the best movie ever made, but for mindless
entertainment, this is a good movie. It made me laugh to see a high
school princess's world throw into a frenzy (no, I am not a cynic and
don't hate all high school princesses). I kinda liked it, and it kept
me awake at work. I am not suggesting going out and buying it; far from
it. But if you get a chance to catch it on TV, and are in the mood for
mindless entertainment, watch it. It tries to capitalize on the genre
of movies like ""Mean Girls"", ""Man of the House"", and ""Bring It On"". I
know that I might be clashing with some of your beliefs about this
movie, but your comments made this out a lot worse than it was, which
is just a funny teenage movie.

When I first saw the trailer to this movie on some other action DVD, I
thought, ""You must be kidding me. This has got to be the worst
straight-to-video HK-action rip-off ever made."" But after watching the first
few minutes of it on cable, I knew the trailer was all wrong. They'd focused
on all the wrong elements. I found ""Love and a Bullet"" to be something of a
black ""Snatch""-type movie (no jokes, now), very tongue-in-cheek and
enjoyably self-referential. The final battle, as silly as it was, was easier

Picture this: a light-hearted action movie about a cold-blooded killer
that
does not hold back on the violence.  Well that pretty much describes Love
and a bullet.  Ironically, whyat makes the the movie light-hearted is the
honest and probably realistic reactions to many of the little speeches as
well as certain actions that the main character has.  A key example being
when a fellow hitman gives him a speeck about ""the life"" and the main
character simply says that after thinking about it for awhile he has no
clue
as to what his associate was talking about.  Also, there are many points
where this movie will fall into the typical hollywood syndrome of making
the
character overyl pathetic with the rush of emotion but it doesnt, instead,
it makes him even more of a badass.  Another unique aspect is that the
majority of the movie is the main character reflecting on how he became a
a
hitman, eventually going into into his confusion over his presetn
situation
and comparing it to another similar event in which he fall s on love with
a
fellow hitman (or hitwoman to be more accurate).
As for the action scenes, three movies came to mind: The Way of the Gun,
Eqilibrium, and Legend of Drunken Master.  The final martial arts bout at
the end clearly shows its Legend of drunkne master unfluence with the
villian fighting mainly on one foot and at oppne time balancing himself on
one foot in a kick stance.  Also, you kinda see a rugh draft of
Equilibrium's gun-kata although Love and a Bulllet's obviously has
break-dancing as a basis for it.  As for way of the gun, i only though of
that becuase there is an instance where a baddy is hiding behind a corner
and his foot is visible by the hero resulting in the baddy's foot being
shot.<br><br>

Rapper Treach (lead singer for Naughty by Nature) plays Malik Bishop, a
stone cold hit man in this violent action movie. Treach gives us a
running narrative on his profession that is sometimes comical,
sometimes profane, but always badass. Handsome, with a bald head and
smooth, ripped physique, covered in gang tattoos, Treach definitely
looks the part. Joining him is an almost all-black caste of enforcers,
thugs and hit men.<br><br>Charles Guardino plays Damien, a white mob boss that specializes in
recruiting young black street muscle and turning them into trained
assassins. We see Treach starting out with a amateur crew and murdering
other brothers with abandon. He coldly slays a black pimp for being
late to meeting. In another early scene he shows he doesn't need a gun
to get the job done by silently strangling a sleeping thug with a white
handkerchief. Impressed by his body count, Damien soon offers him a job
with his organization.<br><br>Treach enters a world where he becomes one of six highly trained black
killers. Along with them being impressive physical specimens, they each
have their own trademark kill techniques. Putting that black muscle on
display, we see them shirtless, or in martial arts gear, working out,
lifting weights and practicing their lethal artistry. We watch as
training leaves them exhausted, buff bodies gleaming with sweat, ready
to do the boss's bidding. But nobody is under any illusions about the
power structure. Damien surrounds himself with bodyguards -- a cadre of
white bodybuilders -- leaving no doubt about how far he trusts his
black employees. As the six assassins admit among themselves after
completing hits ordered by Damien, the world belongs to white men --
they are just there to ""take out the trash."" <br><br>We see some exciting hits, including one where Treach and Buddy, his
best friend on the hit squad, invade a house where a federal witness is
being guarded by marshals. The black killers expertly eliminate each of
the six white lawmen before taking out the witness. Back at
headquarters, Buddy demands more money for his work on hits like these
and a furious Damien marks him for death, sending some of his white
bodyguards to do the deed. In some furious action, involving snapped
necks, close quarter martial arts and expert gunplay, Buddy easily offs
them one by one. Though we don't see who fires the fatal shot, Buddy is
finally slain, with the suspicion that one of the six black killers
took the contract to ice a ""brother.""<br><br>That lesson isn't lost on Treach and he begins to lay plans to leave
the organization -- especially after falling in love with the beautiful
black hit woman Hylene. In a series of graphic sex scenes (including a
full frontal view of Treach's impressive manhood) the romance gets red
hot and it's only a matter of time before Damien lets Treach know that
love isn't healthy in his line of work. Hylene disappears and, at the
same time, Damien orders Treach to snuff Cynda (Damien's black
girlfriend whom he suspects of cheating) installing Treach in a
sniper's nest across the street from her apartment. Even while he's
aiming the rifle at her head, we can see Treach is developing feelings
for her as he watches Damien slap her around. In a sick mind game with
Treach, Damien won't give the final order to kill her, preferring to
taunt Treach by letting him watch while he abuses her -- sometimes even
winking at him from the window. Treach slowly loses it -- day after
day, often stripped to just his boxers, his muscular black torso slick
with sweat -- all the time with his crosshairs on Cynda's lovely face
and Damien's leering smirk right there.<br><br>Having enough of his twisted game Damien calls off the hit, but Treach
has other plans. Knowing that Cynda's life will never improve, he fires
the fatal bullet to free her forever. Damien goes insane and orders his
men to take out Treach and the final battle is on. First his remaining
white musclemen are dispatched but they are no match for Treach's black
fury. Their deaths only infuriate Damien all the more and he turns to
Treach's former ""brothers"" to carry out the hit. In an orgy of
black-on-black violence, Treach faces the best in the business --- and
ices them, one by one. With guns blazing, kicks and fists flying and
some incredible acrobatic fighting moves, each killer meets his end. In
one particularly brutal fight, Treach drives an iron spike clean
through the shaved head of one of his former buddies. Leaving a pile of
black corpses, Treach goes looking for the white man responsible for it
all and, in a hail of bullets, takes Damien's life.<br><br>There is a surprise waiting for Treach at the end of this movie and,
badass killer that he is, you don't begrudge him a little happiness.
Treach makes this movie -- all black muscle and attitude -- and
elevates it beyond just another gangsta outing. The fights are awesome,
the intrigue is cool, the sex is hot and the hits are cleverly staged
-- like Wesley Snipes once famously said in another action movie,
""always bet on black.""

Ben Ramsey and Kantz co-directed ""Love and a Bullet,"" a stylish
romantic action film with an urban twist, in 2002. The film's most
essential component is Malik Bishop (Treach, lead rapper for rap group
Naughty by Nature), a young professional hit-man in Los Angeles who
engages in a would-be forbidden romance with his employer's main
squeeze. The drama in the plot comes from the fact that Bishop's latest
assignment forces him to question his profession for the first time and
reflect on the violent path that his life has taken him. Anyone looking
for a deep rumination or moral dilemmas on the life of a hit-man better
look elsewhere, say ""The Professional"" (1994). But Treach makes an
interesting and charismatic lead character because he lets us get to
know him, like him, and sympathize with the choices he's made and how
he's learning to live with the consequences of those decisions. And
plus he's a just an all-around bad-ass who must ultimately learn to
fend for himself in the film's blood-soaked, action-packed climax. The
movie is also pretty funny, too, albeit in a darkly comic fashion. One
sequence that will have you laughing out loud is when Bishop and his
mentor Buddy (Sam Scarber) lay siege to a house where a federal witness
is being held up and they not only succeed in slaying the witness, but
also the six federal agents protecting him. All the while, Buddy is
complaining about why the job is so messed up because they didn't have
time to plan it properly. Other darkly humorous instances abound, but
that is by far the funniest in the whole movie. Not a perfect film by
any standard, but it does make for a quick 87-minute trip with your
brain locked squarely in the ""off"" position.<br><br>7/10

that for a film put together for half-a-million in 2002, this really

Love and a Bullet is a confused movie.  At times it seems like a comedy
with
the use of the MF word more times in a sentence than any other word.  But
other times with its blood and violence it want to be a film trying to
shock.  All the while filled with philosophy that doesn't make sense to
anyone and they note it.  As love story starts to form, you feel small
moments.  You feel for Bishop on thanksgiving but then it becomes a comedy
of errors again.  This movie could have been better if it decided what it
was before it decided who should die.

if

When I first saw the trailer to this movie on some other action DVD, I
thought, ""You must be kidding me. This has got to be the worst
straight-to-video HK-action rip-off ever made."" But after watching the first
few minutes of it on cable, I knew the trailer was all wrong. They'd focused
on all the wrong elements. I found ""Love and a Bullet"" to be something of a
black ""Snatch""-type movie (no jokes, now), very tongue-in-cheek and
enjoyably self-referential. The final battle, as silly as it was, was easier
to swallow after the movie's setup. After all, it's not a straight
gangsta-action movie; it's more of a black comedy. In both senses of the

                    The love story who transformed Juana, Queen of Spain, into Juana ""The mad"". A story of passions, lies and jealousy with a politic fight behind.
            ","

Juana is married off by her pious parents, the Catholic kings Ferndinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castille, to ally Spain, united by their marriage, to the Burgundian and other Habsburg heritage of archduke Maximilian's son Philip. When they meet, it's love at first sight, for her all-consuming, for him one of many happy bed partnerships as she later discovers. Deaths in her family soon make Juana Isabella's heir, but Ferdinand suggests she inherited her grandmother's madness and supports Philip's ambition to rule instead, which becomes the stakes of political maneuvering in the Cortes (nobility-dominated parliament). Combined with Philip's incurable infidelity, which includes a Moorish whore-princess, multiple drama is inevitable, and worse follows.                Written by

He practiced many sports in his life, boxing, gymnastics, tennis etc. He also worked in a Cyrcus. In the early years of his youth he discovered a great passion for the cinema, he knew the most important Italian actors and his idle Burt Lancaster and decided to start acting. In the beginning, he worked as stunt-man, and in small roles in big productions: in ""Bem Hur"" by William Wyler he works uncredited. Then the director, Duccio Tessari, gave him the first role as protagonist in the film ""Arrivano i Titani"". Luchino Visconti wants him for the role of a general in ""Il gattopardo"" (but the scenes with Gemma will be mostly cut). This was followed by important roles in ""Angelica"", by the French director Bernard Borderie, where Gemma has a leading role; and the first spaghetti western films, where he worked under the name of Montgomery Wood in the first titles. ""Una pistola per Ringo"", ""Il ritorno di Ringo"" and ""Un dollaro bucato"" are among his greatest successes. Then he played his most important roles in ""Il deserto dei Tartari"" by Valerio Zurlini and ""Il prefetto di ferro"" by Pasquale Squitieri. He won important prizes: Best actor at the Festival of Karlovy Vary, Best actor at the MontrÃ©al film festival, and the Grolla d\'Oro in San Vincent Festival. In 1986 he became Cavaliere della Repubblica italiana.In the last years Gemma worked mostly for Italian television, and he discovered another great passion, sculpture.

big-budgeted soap opera, with below-average, lazy or over-keen acting.
Liotti looks positively bored and Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala in the title

seems to be trying too hard, switching back and fourth from
two-dimensional horny-looking to spoilt teenage hysterics all the way

such a fascinating and complex historic era deserved a far superior

<br><br>The movie should be seen chiefly for its main actress, the beautiful and
talented Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala.  She does the absolute best with what the
script gives her.  <br><br>This should be an entertaining and engrossing film, especially for those
interested in Renaissance Europe, but it may be taking just too many
liberties with the historical facts.  It is highly doubtful that the real
Juana became ""mad"" chiefly out of love for an unfaithful husband, who in
this movie is not shown to be particularly interesting anyway. And if the
real Juana was anywhere near as beautiful as the actress who plays her, I
suppose the real Philip would not have been such a mean husband to her. <br><br>Aside from her husband, her father King Fernando of AragÃ³n and most of the
Castilian nobles are not depicted too favorably either. <br><br>Still, this movie is a good movie if you like costume drama, especially one
with a southern European more than an English background.<br><br>

I haven't enjoyed many films from Spain, but ""Juana La Loca"" (curiously
translated by the distributors as ""Mad Love"" instead of the more appropriate
""Joan The Mad"") now tops my list of Spanish language films.
It may not be an accurate portrayal of historical events (it's pretty safe
to say many liberties were taken in that regard), but it's still worth
seeing. Think of it as a play loosely based on historical persons as opposed
to a bio-pic presentation of their lives.<br><br>This is a big, handsome costume drama that evokes Renaissance Spain with
gusto, although there's a certain movieness to the look of things: almost
everyone is abnormally good looking and everyone's clothes are remarkably
clean (Philip, Juana's betrothed, sports a physique that smacks of modern
day gyms; it's doubtful that a monarch who doesn't lift a finger would be so
chiseled).  By contrast, ""Shakespeare In Love"" captured some of the
grubbiness of life during the Renaissance.<br><br>The soundtrack is also a bit heavy-handed, with music that occasionally gets
a bit obvious.<br><br>But overall, this movie attacks its subject matter with relish and
intellect.  Instead of obligatory sword fights and battle sequences, ""Juana
La Loca"" opts for dialogue that oozes with machinations and intrigue, and a
pace that keeps things moving along and the viewer interested.<br><br>I give it 7 on a scale of 10.

True story of ""the mad queen of Castile"" focuses on the innocent
daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella contracted into marriage with the
infamous Hapsburg heir of the Holy Roman Empire. Juana becomes so
enamored of her young libertine husband that her jealously makes her
emotionally unstable. Between the faithlessness of her husband and the
treachery of her unscrupulous father King Ferdinand she is declared mad
and forced into incarceration for most of her life. For a clearer
understanding of the events leading to this, read Lawrence Schoonover's
intriguing biographical novel ""The Prisoner of Tordesillas."" How ironic
that Juana's younger sister Caterina (Katherine of Aragon) was also
betrayed by a ruthless philandering husband (Henry VIII of England) and
incarcerated unto death.

What starts out as a sumptuous setting, with intricate period pieces and
soft light cinematography, is quickly tainted by a very poor script. True,
Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala does give an envigorating rendering of this
misfortunate queen, but after the first scene, it's all the same
shrillness,
over and over again.
Even though the movie takes place over 10 years, the roles don't mature,
either outwardly or inwardly, and the result are wooden characterizations
that don't give any depth (or generate interest, for that matter) to the
roles.
The result is an inane, one-dimensional film that could have easily
resembled similar period pieces such as La reine Margot or Elizabeth.
Instead, it wallows in its own misery.

There is no question that director Vicente Aranda has taken considerable
liberty with generally accepted history, but despite this and a few flaws
within the context of certain scenes, what we have is an excellent story,
and one very well recounted and acted.<br><br>It will come as absolutely no surprise for those who have seen this film to
know that Pilar Lopez de Ayala (as Juana I) and Rosana Pastor (Elvira, Head
of QueenÂ´s Household) are nominated in the lead and supporting categories
of
the Spanish Goya Film Awards, and, despite having been ignored by the
Golden
Globes, this film should be in contention for Oscar Consideration as
SpainÂ´s
representation for the ""Best Foreign Film"" of 2001.  Frankly, the
performances just mentioned were so stunning, especially Pilar Lopez de
Ayala, that I would consider her among nominees for Best Actress at the
Oscars, not only given the absolutely pathetic list the Golden Globes
presented in the Drama category, but simply because Pilar Lopez de Ayala
DESERVES IT, much as did Fernanda Montenegro in the Brazilian masterpiece
""Central Do Brazil"" just a few years back.<br><br>For the historians among the viewing public, my recommendation is to simply
look the other way on the bit of revisionism on display, given that far
greater crimes have been committed by Hollywood as regards same. The story
is excellent, the costumes &amp; design, art direction, cinematography, and
above all film editing are simply tops -- and film editing has been a GREAT
problem in US films in recent times.  Go and see it and I DO MEAN the
original version!  Rating = 4 stars (of five).

Vicente Aranda and his collaborators took liberties when they decided
to base their film on the tragic figure of Juana, a Spanish princess,
the daughter of the Catholic Kings of Spain. Leave it to Mr. Aranda's
feverish imagination, and he will have the viewer thinking this young
woman was a nymphomaniac of epic proportions. Historically this film is
incorrect as it's derailed by the sexual context Mr. Aranda gave the
movie.<br><br>When Juana is sent to Flandes to marry Phillip, little prepared the
young and sheltered woman to find a man who was, above all, a womanizer
and a libertine, who took his pleasure wherever he could find. He
captivates Juana with his good looks and bed manners. In fact,
Phillip's nickname was ""the handsome"", something that comes across in
the way this vain man acts throughout his life.<br><br>Pilar Lopez Ayala, who plays the leading role, shows some passionate
moments in the way she portraits the tragic Juana. Danielle Liotti, is
seen as Phillip. Eloy Azorin appears as Alvaro and Giuliano Gemma is
DeVeyre, Phillip's right hand man.

<br><br>The movie should be seen chiefly for its main actress, the beautiful and
talented Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala.  She does the absolute best with what the
script gives her.  <br><br>This should be an entertaining and engrossing film, especially for those
interested in Renaissance Europe, but it may be taking just too many
liberties with the historical facts.  It is highly doubtful that the real
Juana became ""mad"" chiefly out of love for an unfaithful husband, who in
this movie is not shown to be particularly interesting anyway. And if the
real Juana was anywhere near as beautiful as the actress who plays her, I
suppose the real Philip would not have been such a mean husband to her. <br><br>Aside from her husband, her father King Fernando of AragÃ³n and most of the
Castilian nobles are not depicted too favorably either. <br><br>Still, this movie is a good movie if you like costume drama, especially one
with a southern European more than an English background.<br><br>

I haven't enjoyed many films from Spain, but ""Juana La Loca"" (curiously
translated by the distributors as ""Mad Love"" instead of the more appropriate
""Joan The Mad"") now tops my list of Spanish language films.
It may not be an accurate portrayal of historical events (it's pretty safe
to say many liberties were taken in that regard), but it's still worth
seeing. Think of it as a play loosely based on historical persons as opposed
to a bio-pic presentation of their lives.<br><br>This is a big, handsome costume drama that evokes Renaissance Spain with
gusto, although there's a certain movieness to the look of things: almost
everyone is abnormally good looking and everyone's clothes are remarkably
clean (Philip, Juana's betrothed, sports a physique that smacks of modern
day gyms; it's doubtful that a monarch who doesn't lift a finger would be so
chiseled).  By contrast, ""Shakespeare In Love"" captured some of the
grubbiness of life during the Renaissance.<br><br>The soundtrack is also a bit heavy-handed, with music that occasionally gets
a bit obvious.<br><br>But overall, this movie attacks its subject matter with relish and
intellect.  Instead of obligatory sword fights and battle sequences, ""Juana
La Loca"" opts for dialogue that oozes with machinations and intrigue, and a
pace that keeps things moving along and the viewer interested.<br><br>I give it 7 on a scale of 10.

True story of ""the mad queen of Castile"" focuses on the innocent
daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella contracted into marriage with the
infamous Hapsburg heir of the Holy Roman Empire. Juana becomes so
enamored of her young libertine husband that her jealously makes her
emotionally unstable. Between the faithlessness of her husband and the
treachery of her unscrupulous father King Ferdinand she is declared mad
and forced into incarceration for most of her life. For a clearer
understanding of the events leading to this, read Lawrence Schoonover's
intriguing biographical novel ""The Prisoner of Tordesillas."" How ironic
that Juana's younger sister Caterina (Katherine of Aragon) was also
betrayed by a ruthless philandering husband (Henry VIII of England) and
incarcerated unto death.

What starts out as a sumptuous setting, with intricate period pieces and
soft light cinematography, is quickly tainted by a very poor script. True,
Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala does give an envigorating rendering of this
misfortunate queen, but after the first scene, it's all the same
shrillness,
over and over again.
Even though the movie takes place over 10 years, the roles don't mature,
either outwardly or inwardly, and the result are wooden characterizations
that don't give any depth (or generate interest, for that matter) to the
roles.
The result is an inane, one-dimensional film that could have easily
resembled similar period pieces such as La reine Margot or Elizabeth.
Instead, it wallows in its own misery.

There is no question that director Vicente Aranda has taken considerable
liberty with generally accepted history, but despite this and a few flaws
within the context of certain scenes, what we have is an excellent story,
and one very well recounted and acted.<br><br>It will come as absolutely no surprise for those who have seen this film to
know that Pilar Lopez de Ayala (as Juana I) and Rosana Pastor (Elvira, Head
of QueenÂ´s Household) are nominated in the lead and supporting categories
of
the Spanish Goya Film Awards, and, despite having been ignored by the
Golden
Globes, this film should be in contention for Oscar Consideration as
SpainÂ´s
representation for the ""Best Foreign Film"" of 2001.  Frankly, the
performances just mentioned were so stunning, especially Pilar Lopez de
Ayala, that I would consider her among nominees for Best Actress at the
Oscars, not only given the absolutely pathetic list the Golden Globes
presented in the Drama category, but simply because Pilar Lopez de Ayala
DESERVES IT, much as did Fernanda Montenegro in the Brazilian masterpiece
""Central Do Brazil"" just a few years back.<br><br>For the historians among the viewing public, my recommendation is to simply
look the other way on the bit of revisionism on display, given that far
greater crimes have been committed by Hollywood as regards same. The story
is excellent, the costumes &amp; design, art direction, cinematography, and
above all film editing are simply tops -- and film editing has been a GREAT
problem in US films in recent times.  Go and see it and I DO MEAN the
original version!  Rating = 4 stars (of five).

Vicente Aranda and his collaborators took liberties when they decided
to base their film on the tragic figure of Juana, a Spanish princess,
the daughter of the Catholic Kings of Spain. Leave it to Mr. Aranda's
feverish imagination, and he will have the viewer thinking this young
woman was a nymphomaniac of epic proportions. Historically this film is
incorrect as it's derailed by the sexual context Mr. Aranda gave the
movie.<br><br>When Juana is sent to Flandes to marry Phillip, little prepared the
young and sheltered woman to find a man who was, above all, a womanizer
and a libertine, who took his pleasure wherever he could find. He
captivates Juana with his good looks and bed manners. In fact,
Phillip's nickname was ""the handsome"", something that comes across in
the way this vain man acts throughout his life.<br><br>Pilar Lopez Ayala, who plays the leading role, shows some passionate
moments in the way she portraits the tragic Juana. Danielle Liotti, is
seen as Phillip. Eloy Azorin appears as Alvaro and Giuliano Gemma is
DeVeyre, Phillip's right hand man.

A famous left-wing satirical comedy about two ex-convicts, one of whom escaped jail and then worked his way up from salesman to factory owner, where he oversees a highly mechanized operation where the workers are reduced to mere automatons. Fearful of being exposed over his past, at first by his friend and later by another gangster, the owner chooses to give his factory to the workers, then escapes with his friend to the freedom of the open road.

However - and against all expectations - he never again found a role that lived up to this wonderful first role. As a matter of fact, Henri Marchand did only thirty-five more films in three decades, mostly in bit parts, most of the time uncredited. To make matters worse, his appearances were scant in the late thirties and the late forties. He was even downright absent from the screens between 1939 and 1946. Even while he was rather active in the early thirties, he was in six shorts which left little or no imprint on movie history. Why on earth didn\'t his career bloom? No one could say. And this is all the stranger as this comic actor was among the best in his league. He sometimes escaped this curse though and could occasionally shine in more fleshed-out than usual roles such as those of Passepoil, the funny sidekick in RenÃ© Sti\'s \'Le Bossu\' (1934) or of Germain in Christian-Jaque\'s \'Monsieur Personne\' (1936). The fifties were a little bit hard on him, as he was cast in several good films, oddly enough very often having him wear a cassock (notably in RenÃ© Clair\'s brilliant \'Les belles de nuit\' in 1952). However, the French cinema would have been more inspired to let such a talented thespian express his full potential.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Guy Bellinger              if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nRaymond Cordy ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 6 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(1)  Overview (3)Date of Birth9\xa0December1898,\xa0Vitry-sur-Seine, Val-de-Marne, France Date of Death23\xa0April1956,\xa0Paris, France Birth NameVictor Raymond CordiouxMini Bio (1)          Raymond Cordy was born on December 9, 1898 in Vitry-sur-Seine, Val-de-Marne, France as Victor Raymond Cordioux.

Sobering indeed that this innovative and quite unique early French ""talkie""
has garnered but four reviews. This is akin to the Cistine Chapel going six
months without visitors! <br><br>As any student of early film would have discovered, the premise of ""A Nous
La Liberte"" was undoubtedly ""lifted"" and used by Chaplin in his revered
MODERN TIMES. Others have mentioned this aspect.<br><br>The film is a satirical comment, almost a control experiment from one
viewpoint, focusing on the ideology of big business, and in regard
particularly to newly gestated industrial technology, just how the
individual is viewed as little more than a means to an end. A resource to be
used and no more. Clair poses the question, is the worker..the LITTLE man -
any more or less a free-thinking and needful entity than the embittered
prisoner serving out his time?<br><br>The film follows the fortunes of two ex-cons. One makes it to the top of the
industrialised ant-hill, the other makes it to the nearest sheltered
alleyway or park bench. Whilst Clair experiments freely here with music and
song, the Metropolis-like buildings lend a sombre note to the proceedings at
hand.<br><br>Stylistically dated perhaps now, and the humor betrays its thirties origins,
nevertheless at its core the observations made still hold true. This remains
a critically important cinematic benchmark not just in terms of early French
cinema but also in terms of a director's extraordinary vision so many years
ago.

Emile and Louis are two jailed friends who dream of freedom and plan to
escape. Louis is successful and becomes a phonograph factory tycoon,
after Emile finally breaks out he seeks work at Louis' factory. Tho
initially the harshness of industrialisation keeps them poles apart,
they both come to realise that friendship and being honest to oneself
is far more rewarding than love or any sort of financial gain.<br><br>Ã nous la libertÃ© {orginaly titled LibertÃ© chÃ©rie} is a truly biting
musical satire written and directed by the considerably talented RenÃ©
Clair. Filmed without a script, with Clair giving his actors free
licence to improvise, the picture focuses on the dehumanisation of
workers at an industrial plant. Shifting as it does from prison to this
monstrosity place of work, the viewer is forced to wonder just exactly
which is the prison of the picture? For workers trundle in to work,
punching in to a clock and sitting at a conveyor belt for hours on end,
they are merely robots for this corporate machine, life is indeed
desperately dull.<br><br>Clair pulls no punches in portraying everyone who doesn't work on the
shop floor as greedy capitalist schemers, one sequence literally see
the elite grasping for Francs strewn by the mounting storm. This wind
of change also releases Emile and Louis from their respective
constraints, and it's thru this change that we the viewer are rewarded
with a truly uplifting ending that closes the film magnificently. The
picture was a flop on its initial release, managing to offend parties
from various corners of the globe, but now in this day and age the film
has come to be hailed as something of a French masterpiece, coming some
five years before Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times {Clair's camp even
wanted to sue Chaplin for plagiarism, but Clair actually took it as a
compliment}, this clearly is the template movie for industrial
indictment. At times devilishly funny, at others poignantly sad, Ã nous

digest at least once. 9/10

Clair's Ã nous la libertÃ© is a wonderful satire of modern mass production,

I was lucky enough to see ""A Nous La Liberte"" along with it's sister film
(in my mind, anyway) ""Le Million"" at an early age at the Museum of Modern
Art.  I have never gotten over them.  They are both miracles of studio
production with even many of the exteriors built in studio.  Both films
were
designed by the great Lazare Meerson and evoke the magical Paris of the
20's.  Both films make wonderful, inventive use of music and song, though
neither one is exactly a Musical in the modern sense. ""A Nous La Liberte""
is
also interesting for having been Chaplin's inspiration for much of ""Modern

I saw this on a double-bill with Clair's silent classic 'Paris Qui Dort',
and was initially dismayed that the feathery magic of that film was replaced
by clunking ironies, heavy compositions, and shrill, caterwauling 'music'. 
'A Nous la liberte' is in many ways a forerunner to 'Modern Times', with
about as much political subtlety - the factory assembly line disrupted by an
inept worker would be 'borrowed' by Chaplin, although, instructively, the
sequence is much funnier in the Hollywood film, perhaps because the little
tramp is such a recognised, beloved figure, and the rather non-descript
Louis is not; or perhaps because Chaplin was such a master at pantomime, and
enlivened the mechanical scene with a vibrant display of physical
virtuosity; more probably, it is because Chaplin developed the scene,
showing not only the effect of human error on the most perfect of
technological systems, but also the dehumanising, mechanistic effect of
emergent modern capitalism on its workers.<br><br>Clair sees life for the worker under capitalism as identical with the life
of a convict in prison - both  systems seek to stamp out or rigidly order
humanity, turn people into socially acceptable machines.  With humanity so
thoroughly contained, it is not surprising that it should be a fundamental
human emotion - love - that causes anarchic chaos in this system. <br><br>Clair also links capitalism with criminality - the Big Boss in the film, the
man who engenders the new technocratic society, who unites workers and the
wealthy, past (his own, his friend, his blackmailers), present and future
(the new machines), is an escaped convict.  Despite the rigid heaviness of
the buildings and machines, and the system they uphold, the status quo is
ultimately transitory and fragile.  It's easy to climb the social ladder,
but just as easy to fall, as Emile shows with remarkably good grace.  No
such system - and capitalism claims to be natural - can ever offer stability
or genuine security for the exploiters who need it most: capitalism carries
within itself the seeds of its own destruction.  Clair is also canny or
prescient in linking the new capitalism with emerging fascism throughout
Europe - Emile's factory is ordered on crypto-military lines, with uniforms,
symbols and leader's iconography.<br><br>If Clair's politics are heavy-handed, his visual sensibility is not, and
this film transcends itself when it looses its political shackles and gives
into subversive whimsy, a rondelay of chases, fist-fights, drunken fracas,
Bunuellian iconoclasm.  Clair may not have been as profound a director as
Renoir or Vigo, but neither had his eye, or his way with orchestrating
movement, of creating chaos from order, and vice versa.  The climactic
surreal opening ceremony is obvious politically, but a visual stunner, with
even nature undermining the narcissistic parades of power, in a way that
anticipates Fellini and Kusturica.  <br><br>The spare, oppressive sets are a delight, from the 'Metropolis'-like
factory, to the unwitting mirror-home of the Big Boss.  The end, in its
rueful freedom, is pure Renoir.  The inspired and inventive use of sound
doesn't obscure the fact that much of this movie is beautifully filmed
silent cinema.

This early talkie is an unexpected joy to watch and an artful piece of
transitional cinema. It's difficult to believe that Charlie Chaplin
claimed he never saw RenÃ© Clair's fanciful 1931 musical comedy since it
predates many of the same leitmotifs that came up in ""Modern Times""
five years later, including pointed jabs at corporate greed interlaced
with Keystone Cops-style slapstick. In fact, Clair seems completely
inspired by Chaplin in the way he carefully orchestrates the chase
scenes and the robotic assembly line in this film, so much so that
Chaplin borrowed back the visual cues in ""Modern Times"".<br><br>Clair sets up his story as an elaborate parable centered on two
convicts, best friends Ãmile and Louis, who make toy horses in the
prison assembly line. In a long-planned attempt to escape, Ãmile
escapes thanks to a generous leg-up from Louis, who is caught and
returned back to their cell. Years pass, and Ãmile becomes a successful
industrialist in charge of a phonograph manufacturing business.
Meanwhile, Louis serves out his term and upon release, ironically finds
himself working in the assembly line of Ãmile's factory. After some
hesitation, Louis and Ãmile reunite and join forces with a rapid-fire
series of chaotic complications leading the two friends to realize that
a life away from work may be their true fate.<br><br>The film master does not belabor his sociopolitical statements about
materialism, but it is intriguing in hindsight to appreciate the film's
prescience in showing France disconnected from the encroaching Nazi
menace. Moreover, the film boasts startling visual elements thanks to
Lazare Meerson's unmistakably Expressionist art direction. Henri
Marchand and Raymond Cordy make a fine comedy team as Ãmile and Louis,
though what really shines is the timeless spirit that Clair imbues this
film. The 2002 Criterion Collection DVD includes two deleted scenes, a
brief 1998 interview with Clair's widow, and a twenty-minute short,
""Entr'acte"", that Clair made with French artists Francis Picabia and
Erik Satie. Speaking of Chaplin, in an audio essay, film historian
David Robinson describes the plagiarism suit that the film's producers
brought against Charlie Chaplin when ""Modern Times"" was released.

Made a full 8 years before Gone with the Wind and Wizard of Oz, ""LA
LIBERTÃ Ã NOUS"" does not come across as remote at all even today.
Whenever reference is made to this film, too much attention is
invariably given to the plagiarism alleged against Charles Chaplin.
There is in fact much more in ""Freedom for us"" than the assembly line
syndrome. For example, there is a little bit of a Jean Valjean in the
escaped convict turned tycoon Louis, except that instead of a Javert
hot on his pursuit, he has old buddy Emile left behind in the escape
(reluctantly) coming into his life again after subsequent release.
Emile's own episode has just a little bit of a Cyrano flavour, a
passionate love destined to be unfruitful. In addition to obvious
social satire, the movie itself takes the form of a light musical or
operetta at one time, and farcical Three Stooges madcap at another, and
winds up with the happy wanderers on the road again. In addition to the
two hugely lovable characters, the movie also offers some beautifully
framed shots utilising the lines and angles of buildings and
structures, and then adds life by fluid movements of human objects. An
all time classic.

Rene Clair's first film was the bizarre surrealist short ENTR'ACTE,
which had music (and a cameo) by composer Erik Satie. Also showing up
briefly in that film were two of Satie's young protÃ©gÃ©s, Darius Milhaud
and George Auric.<br><br>When Clair made the talkie A NOUS LA LIBERTE, he hired Auric to do a
completely original score, which was not common at the time, and a lot
of the scenes were shot to recordings of the Auric music. This was only
Auric's 2nd film (after Cocteau's BLOOD OF A POET) but he already shows
the mastery that would lead to well over a hundred further scores.<br><br>Clair and his Oscar-nominated designer fill the screen with wonderful
art deco visuals, and there's a sympathetic cast cemented by the two
central characters, Louis and Emile. There are some wonderful physical
comedy bits in the film (mostly in the factory), as well as the social
satire which I didn't find particularly heavy-handed (although that

This film is feral, anarchic energy, imbued with Clair's keen
intelligence and siphoned through crowd-pleasing Chaplin-y slapstick. I
am constantly reminded of Jean Vigo's timeless ""Conduit Zero"" and
""L'Atalante"" as I guffaw to ""A Nous La Liberte""- this one, through the
course of a lean, sinewy 83 minutes, deconstructs the wholly arbitrary
norms and myths that constitute our mechanized, capitalistic
civilization before illustrating just how easily these protocol are
upset and subverted. I have learned that Rene Clair had previously lent
his hand to the surrealists in the silent era, and that does not
surprise me in the least, for this film is, for all its cynical
realism, is Surrealist in agenda, a thorough exploration of Liberty.<br><br>The premise is simple- two convicts escape from prison and pursue
vastly disparate avenues outside penitentiary walls. One becomes an
unscrupulous opportunist and erects a financial empire, the (rather
effete) other is more smitten with a flighty factory girl than money.
By a dialectical process the two eventually renounce chimeras like
wealth and marriage, opting for a life of Deleuze/Guattari-esquire
nomadism, true freedom unrestrained by social expectation. Clair is
rarely subtle with his jibes- the factory workers are represented as
wholly expendable vessels of labor, weighed and assigned with serial
numbers. Their lives are mechanized to the point of eating slop from a
conveyor belt. <br><br>The Paris that Clair evokes is not a romanticised, perfumed city of
profusion and resplendence, but a graven concrete sarcophagus,
populated with automatons of all varieties. The sole glimpses we get of
organic flora are of wretched-looking daffodils, offered to an
unappreciative object of affection. Most biting are Clair's sketches of
the bourgeoisie, whose cultivated tastes revolve around
rumor-mongering, rococo decor and totally maudlin and cloying music.
Everywhere carnality peers deviously beneath the gaping crevices,
seething and sizzling beneath the Victorian prudishness- look at the
rakish dilettante who woos the tycoon's wife, and the virile factory
worker who commands the secretary's amorous attentions.<br><br>Through the course of the film, Clair's intent is in drawing parallels
between life in the penitentiary with dehumanizing industrial life and
stuffy bourgeois society, illuminating the worrying commonalities that
all three share. The conclusive insight, then, is truly surrealist- man
constructs his own prisons, circumscribing the possibilities of
existence with norms that he then perpetuates with bad faith. When this
epiphany strikes our phonograph magnate, he becomes privy to the sheer
tentativeness of these stifling dogmas, and engages in a journey
towards freedom, culminating in his renunciation of wealth and
reputation.<br><br>The latter half of the film is a STINGING lash against cant and
cupidity, and the film reaches a summit in one of the most uproarious
and singularly BRILLIANT sections in French film- a fierce gust of wind
disrupts an octagenarian's garrulous, grandiloquent (and nauseatingly
vacuous) speech, blowing away the elaborate ornamentation adorning the
speaker's podium and scattering a profusion of overhead banknotes
across the compound. The gathered industrialists resist temptation for
a few moments before a madcap scramble for cash ensues, the bumbling
old speechmaker struggling to recite his script in the resultant mania,
the sole bastion of 'order' in this wild debacle. This is Clair's
consummate statement- beneath the ostentation and contrived niceties,
we can barely obscure our animalistic greed. The wind blows beneath
surfaces and reveals mercenary ardor.<br><br>A political film that you can show to your kids, as well as a
consummate, meticulous masterpiece on par with any Keaton, Chaplin or
Tati. Like those artists and Friedrich Nietzsche, Clair knows all about
the subversive power of laughter. We must take his approach to life, to
nurture the capacity to laugh at all the things we take so gravely, our
environs and even ourselves. This is the wellspring of ecstasy and
freedom in life. I wonder if Luis Bunuel was a fan...

This is a little gem of a film that doesn't date nearly as much as you
would think, considering it come from the early thirties. The masterful
hand of director Rene Clair overcomes an insubstantial plot and imbues
the film with some fantastic visuals, humorous satire and some good
clean knockabout fun. Two prisoners escape from custody and one reaches
the top of the ladder while the other clings onto the bottom rung.
Clair makes his feeling about capitalism clear by showing how the
worker under the capitalist is as much a prisoner as the people locked
in the jail. But any political overtones are not so much that they
interrupt with the comic narrative and the film merrily continues with
it's chases, bottom-kicking and all manner of good-natured silliness.
Highly recommended.

Sobering indeed that this innovative and quite unique early French ""talkie""
has garnered but four reviews. This is akin to the Cistine Chapel going six
months without visitors! <br><br>As any student of early film would have discovered, the premise of ""A Nous
La Liberte"" was undoubtedly ""lifted"" and used by Chaplin in his revered
MODERN TIMES. Others have mentioned this aspect.<br><br>The film is a satirical comment, almost a control experiment from one
viewpoint, focusing on the ideology of big business, and in regard
particularly to newly gestated industrial technology, just how the
individual is viewed as little more than a means to an end. A resource to be
used and no more. Clair poses the question, is the worker..the LITTLE man -
any more or less a free-thinking and needful entity than the embittered
prisoner serving out his time?<br><br>The film follows the fortunes of two ex-cons. One makes it to the top of the
industrialised ant-hill, the other makes it to the nearest sheltered
alleyway or park bench. Whilst Clair experiments freely here with music and
song, the Metropolis-like buildings lend a sombre note to the proceedings at
hand.<br><br>Stylistically dated perhaps now, and the humor betrays its thirties origins,
nevertheless at its core the observations made still hold true. This remains
a critically important cinematic benchmark not just in terms of early French
cinema but also in terms of a director's extraordinary vision so many years
ago.

Emile and Louis are two jailed friends who dream of freedom and plan to
escape. Louis is successful and becomes a phonograph factory tycoon,
after Emile finally breaks out he seeks work at Louis' factory. Tho
initially the harshness of industrialisation keeps them poles apart,
they both come to realise that friendship and being honest to oneself
is far more rewarding than love or any sort of financial gain.<br><br>Ã nous la libertÃ© {orginaly titled LibertÃ© chÃ©rie} is a truly biting
musical satire written and directed by the considerably talented RenÃ©
Clair. Filmed without a script, with Clair giving his actors free
licence to improvise, the picture focuses on the dehumanisation of
workers at an industrial plant. Shifting as it does from prison to this
monstrosity place of work, the viewer is forced to wonder just exactly
which is the prison of the picture? For workers trundle in to work,
punching in to a clock and sitting at a conveyor belt for hours on end,
they are merely robots for this corporate machine, life is indeed
desperately dull.<br><br>Clair pulls no punches in portraying everyone who doesn't work on the
shop floor as greedy capitalist schemers, one sequence literally see
the elite grasping for Francs strewn by the mounting storm. This wind
of change also releases Emile and Louis from their respective
constraints, and it's thru this change that we the viewer are rewarded
with a truly uplifting ending that closes the film magnificently. The
picture was a flop on its initial release, managing to offend parties
from various corners of the globe, but now in this day and age the film
has come to be hailed as something of a French masterpiece, coming some
five years before Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times {Clair's camp even
wanted to sue Chaplin for plagiarism, but Clair actually took it as a
compliment}, this clearly is the template movie for industrial
indictment. At times devilishly funny, at others poignantly sad, Ã nous
la libertÃ© is a cinematic gem that all serious film lovers should
digest at least once. 9/10

Clair's Ã nous la libertÃ© is a wonderful satire of modern mass production,
magnificently shot, directed, decently acted and with impressive sets. The
satirical content is stressed but not too on-your-face. The main reaction
to
the film is delight.<br><br>Some of the sequences were an obvious inspiration to Chaplin, whose
masterpiece Modern Times resembles this film quite a lot both in the way
it
looks as well as thematically.<br><br>The picture and sound quality, at least in the version shown on Finnish
TV,
are superb which is surprising considering the age of the film.<br><br>The music is good and well used, except the songs which are slightly
irritating. Still, this is a great and pleasing film with a very amusing
scene in the end, taking place at the opening of a new factory.

I was lucky enough to see ""A Nous La Liberte"" along with it's sister film
(in my mind, anyway) ""Le Million"" at an early age at the Museum of Modern
Art.  I have never gotten over them.  They are both miracles of studio
production with even many of the exteriors built in studio.  Both films
were
designed by the great Lazare Meerson and evoke the magical Paris of the
20's.  Both films make wonderful, inventive use of music and song, though
neither one is exactly a Musical in the modern sense. ""A Nous La Liberte""
is
also interesting for having been Chaplin's inspiration for much of ""Modern
Times.""

I saw this on a double-bill with Clair's silent classic 'Paris Qui Dort',
and was initially dismayed that the feathery magic of that film was replaced
by clunking ironies, heavy compositions, and shrill, caterwauling 'music'. 
'A Nous la liberte' is in many ways a forerunner to 'Modern Times', with
about as much political subtlety - the factory assembly line disrupted by an
inept worker would be 'borrowed' by Chaplin, although, instructively, the
sequence is much funnier in the Hollywood film, perhaps because the little
tramp is such a recognised, beloved figure, and the rather non-descript
Louis is not; or perhaps because Chaplin was such a master at pantomime, and
enlivened the mechanical scene with a vibrant display of physical
virtuosity; more probably, it is because Chaplin developed the scene,
showing not only the effect of human error on the most perfect of
technological systems, but also the dehumanising, mechanistic effect of
emergent modern capitalism on its workers.<br><br>Clair sees life for the worker under capitalism as identical with the life
of a convict in prison - both  systems seek to stamp out or rigidly order
humanity, turn people into socially acceptable machines.  With humanity so
thoroughly contained, it is not surprising that it should be a fundamental
human emotion - love - that causes anarchic chaos in this system. <br><br>Clair also links capitalism with criminality - the Big Boss in the film, the
man who engenders the new technocratic society, who unites workers and the
wealthy, past (his own, his friend, his blackmailers), present and future
(the new machines), is an escaped convict.  Despite the rigid heaviness of
the buildings and machines, and the system they uphold, the status quo is
ultimately transitory and fragile.  It's easy to climb the social ladder,
but just as easy to fall, as Emile shows with remarkably good grace.  No
such system - and capitalism claims to be natural - can ever offer stability
or genuine security for the exploiters who need it most: capitalism carries
within itself the seeds of its own destruction.  Clair is also canny or
prescient in linking the new capitalism with emerging fascism throughout
Europe - Emile's factory is ordered on crypto-military lines, with uniforms,
symbols and leader's iconography.<br><br>If Clair's politics are heavy-handed, his visual sensibility is not, and
this film transcends itself when it looses its political shackles and gives
into subversive whimsy, a rondelay of chases, fist-fights, drunken fracas,
Bunuellian iconoclasm.  Clair may not have been as profound a director as
Renoir or Vigo, but neither had his eye, or his way with orchestrating
movement, of creating chaos from order, and vice versa.  The climactic
surreal opening ceremony is obvious politically, but a visual stunner, with
even nature undermining the narcissistic parades of power, in a way that
anticipates Fellini and Kusturica.  <br><br>The spare, oppressive sets are a delight, from the 'Metropolis'-like
factory, to the unwitting mirror-home of the Big Boss.  The end, in its
rueful freedom, is pure Renoir.  The inspired and inventive use of sound
doesn't obscure the fact that much of this movie is beautifully filmed
silent cinema.

This early talkie is an unexpected joy to watch and an artful piece of
transitional cinema. It's difficult to believe that Charlie Chaplin
claimed he never saw RenÃ© Clair's fanciful 1931 musical comedy since it
predates many of the same leitmotifs that came up in ""Modern Times""
five years later, including pointed jabs at corporate greed interlaced
with Keystone Cops-style slapstick. In fact, Clair seems completely
inspired by Chaplin in the way he carefully orchestrates the chase
scenes and the robotic assembly line in this film, so much so that
Chaplin borrowed back the visual cues in ""Modern Times"".<br><br>Clair sets up his story as an elaborate parable centered on two
convicts, best friends Ãmile and Louis, who make toy horses in the
prison assembly line. In a long-planned attempt to escape, Ãmile
escapes thanks to a generous leg-up from Louis, who is caught and
returned back to their cell. Years pass, and Ãmile becomes a successful
industrialist in charge of a phonograph manufacturing business.
Meanwhile, Louis serves out his term and upon release, ironically finds
himself working in the assembly line of Ãmile's factory. After some
hesitation, Louis and Ãmile reunite and join forces with a rapid-fire
series of chaotic complications leading the two friends to realize that
a life away from work may be their true fate.<br><br>The film master does not belabor his sociopolitical statements about
materialism, but it is intriguing in hindsight to appreciate the film's
prescience in showing France disconnected from the encroaching Nazi
menace. Moreover, the film boasts startling visual elements thanks to
Lazare Meerson's unmistakably Expressionist art direction. Henri
Marchand and Raymond Cordy make a fine comedy team as Ãmile and Louis,
though what really shines is the timeless spirit that Clair imbues this
film. The 2002 Criterion Collection DVD includes two deleted scenes, a
brief 1998 interview with Clair's widow, and a twenty-minute short,
""Entr'acte"", that Clair made with French artists Francis Picabia and
Erik Satie. Speaking of Chaplin, in an audio essay, film historian
David Robinson describes the plagiarism suit that the film's producers
brought against Charlie Chaplin when ""Modern Times"" was released.

Made a full 8 years before Gone with the Wind and Wizard of Oz, ""LA
LIBERTÃ Ã NOUS"" does not come across as remote at all even today.
Whenever reference is made to this film, too much attention is
invariably given to the plagiarism alleged against Charles Chaplin.
There is in fact much more in ""Freedom for us"" than the assembly line
syndrome. For example, there is a little bit of a Jean Valjean in the
escaped convict turned tycoon Louis, except that instead of a Javert
hot on his pursuit, he has old buddy Emile left behind in the escape
(reluctantly) coming into his life again after subsequent release.
Emile's own episode has just a little bit of a Cyrano flavour, a
passionate love destined to be unfruitful. In addition to obvious
social satire, the movie itself takes the form of a light musical or
operetta at one time, and farcical Three Stooges madcap at another, and
winds up with the happy wanderers on the road again. In addition to the
two hugely lovable characters, the movie also offers some beautifully
framed shots utilising the lines and angles of buildings and
structures, and then adds life by fluid movements of human objects. An
all time classic.

Rene Clair's first film was the bizarre surrealist short ENTR'ACTE,
which had music (and a cameo) by composer Erik Satie. Also showing up
briefly in that film were two of Satie's young protÃ©gÃ©s, Darius Milhaud
and George Auric.<br><br>When Clair made the talkie A NOUS LA LIBERTE, he hired Auric to do a
completely original score, which was not common at the time, and a lot
of the scenes were shot to recordings of the Auric music. This was only
Auric's 2nd film (after Cocteau's BLOOD OF A POET) but he already shows
the mastery that would lead to well over a hundred further scores.<br><br>Clair and his Oscar-nominated designer fill the screen with wonderful
art deco visuals, and there's a sympathetic cast cemented by the two
central characters, Louis and Emile. There are some wonderful physical
comedy bits in the film (mostly in the factory), as well as the social
satire which I didn't find particularly heavy-handed (although that
adjective has been used by others). The fine balance of music, visuals,
and comedy makes this a winner.

Wary of fame and repelled by formulaic Hollywood fare, he has built a successful career playing underdogs and odd men out--all the while avoiding the media spotlight. John was born in Evanston, Illinois, to an Irish-American family. With the exception of mom Nancy (nÃ©e Carolan), a former math teacher, the Cusack clan is all show business: father Dick Cusack was an actor and filmmaker, and John\'s siblings Joan Cusack, Ann Cusack, Bill Cusack and Susie Cusack are all thespians by trade. Like his brother and sisters, John became a member of Chicago\'s Piven Theatre Workshop while he was still in elementary school. By age 12, he already had several stage productions, commercial voice overs and industrial films under his belt. He made his feature film debut at 17, acting alongside Rob Lowe and Andrew McCarthy in the romantic comedy Class (1983). His next role, as a member of Anthony Michael Hall\'s geek brigade in Sixteen Candles (1984), put him on track to becoming a teen-flick fixture. Cusack remained on the periphery of the Brat Pack, sidestepping the meteoric rise and fall of most of his contemporaries, but he stayed busy with leads in films like The Sure Thing (1985) and Better Off Dead... (1985). Young Cusack is probably best remembered for what could be considered his last adolescent role: the stereo-blaring romantic Lloyd Dobler in Say Anything... (1989). A year later, he hit theaters as a grown-up, playing a bush-league con man caught between his manipulative mother and headstrong girlfriend in The Grifters (1990).The next few years were relatively quiet for the actor, but he filled in the gaps with off-screen projects. He directed and produced several shows for the Chicago-based theater group The New Criminals, which he founded in 1988 (modeling it after Tim Robbins\' Actors\' Gang in Los Angeles) to promote political and avant-garde stage work. Four years later, Cusack\'s high school friends Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis joined him in starting a sister company for film, New Crime Productions. New Crime\'s first feature was the sharply written comedy Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), which touched off a career renaissance for Cusack. In addition to co-scripting, he starred as a world-weary hit man who goes home for his ten-year high school reunion and tries to rekindle a romance with the girl he stood up on prom night (Minnie Driver). In an instance of life imitating art, Cusack actually did go home for his ten-year reunion (to honor a bet about the film\'s financing) and ended up in a real-life romance with Driver. Cusack\'s next appearance was as a federal agent (or, as he described it, ""the first post-Heston, non-biblical action star in sandals"") in Con Air (1997), a movie he chose because he felt it was time to make smart business decisions. He followed that with Clint Eastwood\'s Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997), in which he played a Yankee reporter entangled in a Savannah murder case.Cusack has always favored offbeat material, so it was no surprise when he turned up in the fiercely original Being John Malkovich (1999). Long-haired, bearded and bespectacled, he was almost unrecognizable in the role of a frustrated puppeteer who stumbles across a portal into the brain of actor John Malkovich. The convincing performance won him a Best Actor nomination at the Independent Spirit Awards. In 2000, Cusack was back to his clean-shaven self in High Fidelity (2000), another New Crime production. He worked with Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis to adapt Nick Hornby\'s popular novel (relocating the story to their native Chicago), then starred as the sarcastic record store owner who revisits his ""Top 5"" breakups to find out why he\'s so unlucky in love. The real Cusack has been romantically linked with several celebs, including Driver, Alison Eastwood, Claire Forlani and Neve Campbell. He\'s also something of a family man, acting frequently opposite sister Joan Cusack and pulling other Cusacks into his films on a regular basis. He seems pleased with the spate of projects on his horizon, but admits that he still hasn\'t reached his ultimate goal: to be involved in a ""great piece of art"".- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       IMDb Editors          Trade Mark (4)        Dark, unruly hair        Distinctive, clipped way of speaking        Offbeat, quirky characters        Tall but often hunched frameTrivia (47)      Brother of Joan Cusack, Ann Cusack, Susie Cusack and Bill Cusack.

Some kind of reference to his favorite bands (usually The Clash, The Ramones or The Specials) makes at least one appearance in most of his films. Most of the time, he wears a T-shirt of one of the bands (Say Anything... (1989), High Fidelity (2000), Must Love Dogs (2005), etc), but sometimes (Grosse Pointe Blank (1997)) he works in a poster of one of the bands.

I\'m not into the celebrity culture aspect of being an artist. To me it represents extinction. The more people know about you, the less they want to try to figure out what you have to say in your movies, and the less credibility you have. To me it seems: Go do your thing, then get out. That\'s the best way to do it. (January 14, 2004)      Nope, no sex scandals yet. But I am open to offers! (January 14, 2004)      I won\'t call myself a child actor because that sounds psychotic.      I\'m aware of the affection those characters inspired. I feel close to Lloyd in Say Anything... (1989). He was like a super-interesting version of me. Only I\'m not as good as him. Whatever part of me is romantic and optimistic, I reached into that to play Lloyd. Of course, now it\'s all gone. Now I\'m just bitter.      [2007] I\'ve made 10 good films. The ones that suck I tend to blank out. It\'s like I never even made them. Well, there aren\'t 40 that are great, put it that way. But that\'s fine. Ten is a good batting average.      You think about the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who have died and all the soldiers who have come back wounded and maimed. You read the paper and four more soldiers last week died and mercenaries have killed 27 people in Baghdad, mercenaries who are getting money from our tax dollars that should be going to protect the troops, and I\'m depressed about the Cubs game. There\'s a disconnect there. My point in all seriousness is that it\'s such an abstraction, and this government has asked us to sacrifice nothing for this. The troops are sacrificing everything. It just seems like an obscenity.      [1998, on his career and life] I feel very blessed, very fortunate, very happy. I love my work, I love my friends, I love my family. There was a period when I didn\'t work for about two years when I was about 25, 26, and I couldn\'t imagine what I would do with my life and that was scary. But now I have other things I love. I\'m a pretty good kick boxer; I\'m a pretty good writer; there are things I could fall back on. And you know how it is--the minute you realize that your options are unlimited, things just start falling into place all around you.      [on why he lives in Los Angeles] I kept saying that I\'d never live in L.A., and I didn\'t think I would. But that\'s where the work is, and I ended up making a lot of friends there, and my old friends moved out to Los Angeles too. And also, I think when you\'re famous, its hard to live in a small town. Not that Chicago is a \'small\' town, but when I\'m there, which I am it lot because I love it and I still have an apartment there, people stare at me. It\'s like I\'m more famous in Chicago. In L.A. and New York, nobody gives a fuck; in a big city, you can quietly do your thing.      [on if he prefers Chicago or Los Angeles] Chicago\'s a great city - definitely my favorite. But I\'m more at home in L.A. because so many of my old friends are here now. I mean, I feel at home in both. What\'s hard in Chicago is that I\'m more conspicuous when I\'m there. It\'s harder to coast around.Martian Child (2007) was just a movie the studio [New Line Cinema] offered me and it was the best job I could get at the time. It was about a relationship between a guy and another kid, and I thought that was good. It was a sweet movie. They offered it to me and that was the extent of that. Grace Is Gone (2007) was something I REALLY wanted to do.      [on giving interviews] I don\'t like doing them. If it was up to me, I\'d just put the movies out there. Or maybe I\'d do a couple - I\'d think of some smart things to say so people think, ""Oh, he\'s cool."" It doesn\'t seem polite to try to be in the limelight more. I don\'t even know if I was invited in to begin with. I\'m well aware that I might have worn out my welcome already.      If I feel they\'re playing with the tiger too much, I\'m like: don\'t go there. Don\'t get into it. That stuff only goes one way. If people are constantly reading about you, and you\'re overexposed, they\'ve got no reason to go see your movies. Also, it\'s not pleasant or nice to have your privacy invaded.      [on if acting has become more of a distraction] Uh, I don\'t think so. Acting can be pretty challenging. I can\'t say making a romantic comedy is challenging, but to do anything well, you have to put yourself into it. But no, if I\'m doing some commercial movie just to keep my name in the public eye, then it\'s just a job. You don\'t have to sweat it too hard.      [on actors being \'tortured\' people] I probably believed in it a bit when I was younger. Actors are weird enough as it is. We don\'t need to act tortured. I\'m probably tortured enough.      [on if he enjoys acting] Sure. Depends on the film. I like to take risks. With acting, you wanna see if you can get into trouble without knowing how you\'re gonna get out of it. It\'s like the exact opposite of war, where you need an exit strategy. When you\'re acting, you should get all the way into trouble with no exit strategy, and have the cameras rolling.      [on doing 2012 (2009)] It\'s sort of the way the business is. If you do one type of movie it makes it a lot easier to do other kinds of movie that you want to do. It\'s just reality. But it\'s nice to get that call. ""It\'s Sony\'s big release of the year, you\'ve got the lead role."" I thought, ""Why not?"".      The movies have got more corporate. They\'re making fewer movies in general, and those they are making are all $200m-$300m tent-pole releases that eat up all the oxygen.      [at the Maine political delegation breakfast on July 26, 2004, seeing Al Franken in the audience] I\'m not going to try and be funny. (Franken replied, ""I\'m not going to try and act."")      Sometimes I\'m think I\'m in control, but more and more I realize that it\'s just a complete farce. It used to be that if you did a big, big movie then you could leverage it and make some smaller, cooler ones. And I got away with that for a few years. But now they just want you to put on tights. If you don\'t put on the tights they just want to get rid of you. And I\'m not putting on the tights. So you know...      L.A. is a town full of so many desert crazies, snake-oil salesmen, carnival barkers and fake spiritualists that it\'s impossible to spot a real one.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nJames Spader ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 53 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(2)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(24)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(19)\xa0|Salary\xa0(2)  Overview (4)Date of Birth7\xa0February1960,\xa0Boston, Massachusetts, USA Birth NameJames Todd SpaderNicknameJimmy    Height5\'\xa010""\xa0(1.78\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          James Todd Spader was born on February 7, 1960 in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of teachers Jean (Fraser) and Stoddard Greenwood ""Todd"" Spader.

Kelley television series The Practice (1997) and its spin-off Boston Legal (2004).He won 3 prime time Emmy Awards in the Best Actor, Drama category for playing the same character Alan Shore in two different television series \'The Practice\' and \'Boston Legal\' out of the 4 nominations he received for the same between the years 2004-2008.

Loves cooking and is an excellent chef.      Has very poor eyesight, and cannot wear contact lenses.

First performer to win Leading Drama Actor Emmy Awards for portraying the same character (Alan Shore) on two different series (The Practice (1997) and Boston Legal (2004)).

Good friends with actors Christian Clemenson, Robert Downey Jr., Eric Stoltz and Jason Alexander.

His father died two weeks before he began production on Critical Care (1997).      Has a photographic memory. He can look at a script and he remembers what the pages look like. As he films a scene, he ""reads"" the page. The only reason he screws up a line is if very similar words (e.g. it and is) are written fairly close together.

Spader even dined occasionally with John Jr. at his mother Jacqueline Kennedy\'s Upper East Side apartment in New York.Personal Quotes (19)      If I don\'t need the money, I don\'t work. I don\'t mind going to somebody and saying, ""Okay, this is how much money I need to pay my bills for the next six months. If you pay me that, I\'ll do the film."".      (Why did he accept the lead in Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)?): I took the film because I was interested in doing that part. Looking at work as stepping stones is something I don\'t have any time or energy for. It seems a shame to look at your work as some sort of means to an end, because the end is death, you know? The means is the flesh and blood, so you\'d better enjoy it. F--- the end.      If I don\'t need the money, I don\'t work. I\'m going to spend time with my family and friends, and I\'m going to travel and read and listen to music and try to learn a little bit more about how to be a human being, as opposed to learning how to be somebody else.      Studio people are afraid of Crash (1996). It makes a statement about whoever releases the film. Miramax took a lot of flak for releasing Kids (1995). The same will happen for whoever releases Crash (1996).      I have my own artistic sensibilities and Crash (1996) complements them. It is a provocative, challenging, disturbing film made for adults. It\'s not a skeleton in the closet for me.      (on his sadomasochistic scenes in the movie Secretary (2002)): I did something in that scene that I\'d never done in a film before but that\'s been the case with so many of my movies.      You just want to work. I like playing character roles and I do not mind being a real son-of-a-bitch, or embarrassing myself. But as you go along you begin to realize that the work has a criterion and as your choices get broader you start cutting out the things that are not worth the time. On the whole I have been lucky; I do not look back with a huge amount of distaste for the work I have done.      Acting is a great way to make a living, especially when I consider what my alternatives were and probably still are. I mean, you are only making movies. It is a lot less pressure than being a surgeon; although it seemed like the only other thing that I was qualified for was manual labour.      Sometimes with people their work is the most important thing to them, and sometimes the work enables you to do other things that are more important to you. I probably am closer to that.      [2005] I\'ve had a lazy career, sometimes one film a year, sometimes none. I\'m walking around in the street and doing this other thing, living, that I\'m much more interested in. I just do some acting on the side.      I played cops and robbers and pirates and all the rest when I was a kid, but I didn\'t want to grow up and be an actor and play cops and robbers and pirates. I wanted to grow up and be that, be cops and robbers and pirates.      I grew up a Red Sox fan. I grew up going to Fenway Park and the Museum of Fine Arts and the Science Museum and Symphony Hall and going to the Common, walking around. My whole family at different times lived and worked in Boston.      [1990] You know, when you choose to make your living as an actor, it\'s all fine and good to look at it as some kind of artistic endeavor. At its best, it is that. But the fact is, most of the actors out there don\'t earn $3 million a picture and can\'t afford to take two years off between films and look for the right thing. Most of us are tradesmen. Acting for me, is a passion, but it\'s also a job, and I\'ve always approached it as such. I have a certain manual-laborist view of acting. There\'s no shame in taking a film because you need some money. No shame in taking a film because you have always wanted to visit China. I was thinking about this last night as I was driving home. I started to go back through the different films I\'ve done, and the television movies I\'ve done and I started to think about why I chose them at that time. And I realized, every single film I\'ve ever done I\'ve taken because of the money. Every single one. I\'m not ashamed to say that.      [1990] I had real trouble, actually, for a long time, getting people to hire me. My anxiety used to manifest itself in strange ways. I\'d go in to read for some innocent, vulnerable character, and the feedback would be, ""Well, we met Jimmy... and he scared us."".      [1995] I\'m not eager at all to present my life out there for public consumption. I like to do one or two films a year and then do what is absolutely obligatory in terms of promoting them. My life outside of films is vital to me.      [on doing Stargate (1994)] I didn\'t have a great knowledge of this genre. The only demand I was putting on the picture was that my paycheck came in and that I had fun making it. It seemed like it would be rather light-hearted. And it was. I\'m not a big fan of films that take themselves seriously.      [on his menial jobs before acting] I drove a truck for a while for a meat packing plant. I shoveled manure at the Clarmont Riding Academy in New York. Mopped floors for a while. I uploaded railroad cars and trailers at a warehouse. I wasn\'t really qualified for anything else.      When you\'re a kid running around playing make-believe, everything is changing from moment to moment - and a TV show is like that too. That\'s what I got into the business for! I like to know just enough to do the job.      I\'ve always loved antiheroes. Those were the characters I was drawn to growing up, and if I\'m equipped to play a hero at all, it\'s certainly an antihero!Salary (2)Stargate\xa0(1994)      $1,000,000       Secretary\xa0(2002)      $400,000 + gross points          if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nImogen Stubbs ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 11 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(2)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(7)  Overview (2)Date of Birth20\xa0February1961,\xa0Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Tyne and Wear, England, UK Height5\'\xa06""\xa0(1.68\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Imogen Stubbs was born in Northumberland, lived briefly in Portsmouth, where her father was a naval officer, and then moved with her parents to London, where they inhabited an elderly river barge on the Thames.

He is of Russian Jewish and Latvian Jewish descent. Growing up, he began singing in synagogue choirs at the age of 13-14 and still continues to use his fantastic voice in musicals and in recordings. Attending Juilliard, he became good friends with actor Kelsey Grammer and upon hearing that Cheers (1982) was auditioning for the role of Dr. Frasier Crane he immediately put Grammer\'s name forward for the role. Rumours persist about Patinkin\'s sudden departure from Criminal Minds (2005). He simply failed to show up one day for a table read. He has contacted the entire cast to explain what is referred to as ""personal reasons"" for leaving. It seems that although Patinkin was prepared for the show to include violence the actual level of violence portrayed was unacceptable to the actor. He left to do more light hearted work.

I try to say something about the human condition whenever I can when I\'m lucky.      I\'m just an actor. I am nothing special. An actor is only as good as what they have on the page in front of them, and anyone who tells you differently is full of shit.      The biggest public mistake I ever made was that I chose to do Criminal Minds (2005) in the first place.      [re quitting Criminal Minds (2005)] It wasn\'t the right fit. I made a choice I didn\'t want to make. I pushed myself, thinking I needed more fame, more economic security. One of the greatest gifts that Homeland (2011) has given me is it\'s affirming on a daily basis. I\'m always with the script, walking around with this stuff 24/7, so my head\'s in a good place. The role is about listening, and when you don\'t listen to yourself, you get in trouble. I wasn\'t listening to myself in Heartburn (1986) [from which he was fired]. I listened to [my agent and] the culture at large saying, \'You\'ve got to be in a movie, this is going to make you,\' and it wasn\'t who I was. Yes, I did Yentl (1983) and Dick Tracy (1990), but I felt, and I still feel a little bit today that I\'m really not successful, because I didn\'t become a movie star. The irony is half of those movie stars are all trying to be in television shows like this.      I struggled with letting in other people\'s opinions. During Chicago Hope (1994), I never let directors talk to me, because I was so spoiled. I started off with people like Milos Forman, Sidney Lumet, James Lapine, unbelievably gifted people. So there I was saying, \'Don\'t talk to me, I don\'t want your opinion.\' I behaved abominably. I don\'t care if my work was good or if I got an award for it. I\'m not proud of how I was then, and it pained me.      [re his father, physically impaired in an accident] If you\'d say, \'What was your father\'s greatest pain?\' it\'s that he couldn\'t play catch with me because he couldn\'t control his right hand. He was worried that he would throw the ball too hard and too fast and he\'d hurt me. I remember when my aunts and uncles would say, \'You don\'t know your father,\' meaning before the brain accident. My little kid-ness was going, \'What do you mean I didn\'t know my father?\' He was a great man. He taught himself how to walk again, to write with his left hand. My father was a hero.      [re his role as Saul in Homeland (2011)] When were you afraid? Why? Did you pray? Shake? Sweat? The way I like to work is to attach personal experiences to what I\'m doing, so it helps tremendously if I can write my own play under what the writer has written. Saul\'s heart is in his head. He dreams for the greater good of the world. Saul is now 60 years old, as I am, and he has had a full life in his business, as I have, and he doesn\'t know how long he gets to be around, as I don\'t. He recognizes the gift of youth personified by his child in this piece, who is Carrie. He believes that both the savantlike and intellectual qualities of Carrie\'s nature are the greatest single hope for humanity. He believes so deeply in her possibilities.      [on working with F. Murray Abraham in Homeland (2011)] Murray loves what he does - I think he loves it more than breathing. He has a \'quiet\' about him that draws you to him and commands your attention. He\'s a thrill to work with, meaning he almost does it all for you, you just need to show up and be in the room with him.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['Peter Burton', '""""']","[[<bound method Tag.get_text of <p>

True Colors is an intelligently plotted drama that never insults your

amazing knack to manipulate people.  James Spader is also excellent as Tim
Gerrity, who becomes Burton's best friend.  Not a moment of this movie is
wasted, nor a single line of dialog.  We see Burton advance his political
career by hook and by crook.  We see Gerrity's idealism tested.  And we see
how Burton's choices cost him in the end.<br><br>The plot would not work if Cusack weren't so convincing.  His Burton is so
good at talking people into things, he can even talk himself into doing
things he knows are wrong, dangerous, or both.  While Cusack is at the

uses manipulation and ruthlessness on his way to a congressional seat. This

the finale is pretty tacked on.<br><br>The movie aspires to be a movie like ""Patriot Games"" or ""Citizen Kane.""
But everything is routine and predictable and there are precious few
new touches to this tired formula. If screenwriter Kevin Wade could've
given the script a bit more depth and discovery into these characters
and done a little more with the formula, this could have really been
something special. The cast does what it can, but inevitably, a good
cast can only take a movie so far. Still, it's worth seeing just for

During the summer of 1992, when I was just a young lad of 19, my
friend's mother rented TRUE COLORS, and, while I was over, she told me that
she already saw the movie and that I should watch it because she thought I
would like it. TRUE COLORS changed my life.  After watching the movie I got
pumped up to go to law school and I am now attending NEW YORK LAW
SCHOOL.
The movie has intelligent characters, a deep plot, and a powerful
message.  This movie is not like the tripe that Hollywood is pumping out on
a daily basis today, but it is more like the classic filmnoir movies of the
1940's.  This movie demonstrates that the lust for power, if unchecked,
corrupts.
That following Christmas my friend's family gave me TRUE COLORS as a
Christmas gift.  I still have it and watch it maybe around twice every few
months to remind myself why I am in law school. 
Other movies that I recommend include:  THE
FIRM, FALLING DOWN, SCARFACE, and 8mm.  <br><br>

For cinema in general, even if a story is derivative or clichÃ©d, good
writing can sometimes bolster an average or even sub-par story. Take
director Herbert Ross's ""True Colors"" staring 2 young and talented
actors of that 1991 year, John Cusack and James Spader. You can sniff
out the storyline from a mile away. It lacked surprise and is utterly
predictable. Even so, it doesn't matter because despite this, the
filmmakers and actors keep it interesting with good lead and supporting
performances, and fairly good dialog and acting. Top punchline in
dialog was the saying about ""morning dew"" - if you see the movie you'll
know. Still, there is some cheese on sound in the stodgy old 90s era
Jazz background, and the 80s materialism and hairdos. Overall though I
liked Spader and especially Cusack who were a great pairing and full of
energy. Good Movie - 7/10 Recommended.

I found this movie very entertaining because the character played by John
Cusack is somewhat of a tragic hero. Are his actions planned or
instinctive?
I just wonder whether the title refers to his character or to the one
played
by Jame Spader. Overall, the movie has a good message and always holds the
viewers attention.

Peter Burton (John Cusack) and Tim Garrity (James Spader) are waiting
for Peter's congressional election results. The movie flashes back to
University of Virginia Law School where the two best friend first met
in a fender bender. Tim is from a rich family and plans to pursue a
career in justice. His girlfriend Diana (Imogen Stubbs), the daughter
of Senator Stiles (Richard Widmark), breaks up with him. Peter is
ambitious and amoral social climber coming from a poor background. He
had an affair with Diana and even marries her. Despite that, Tim stays
as Peter's best man. Peter's rise in politics involve mob-connected
John Palmieri (Mandy Patinkin) putting him in direct conflict with Tim
who joined the Justice Department.<br><br>These are two of the best actors of their age. They do their utmost but
the story unfolds with a series of plot points. Concentrating on Peter
Burton could have made this an interesting dark movie. This has the
feel of a Brat Pack movie trying to do politics although the guys bring
it. This film is unable to build tension and lacks the intensity that
it deserves.

It's odd how some movies really resonate with you as individual but do
not necessarily have mass appeal. I think this is a sleeper, not many
people have seen it. This is one of my favourites &amp; a movie I go back
to from time to time. It's a real journey, picking Spader &amp; Cusack's
characters up as they commence college like &amp; following them for the
next 10 years or so into there respective careers &amp; personal lives.<br><br>While both are high achievers; Spader comes from a successful wealthy
family &amp; Cusack from a modest working class back ground. Consequently
there attitudes &amp; what drives them is completely different. I found
exploring both characters fascinating as there relationship is put
under enormous strain.<br><br>It's set from 1984 onwards so if you enjoy being nostalgic over that
capitalistic age, &amp; enjoyed the brat pack movies, this will help. Also
an excellent score by Michael Lang called fanfare. Hope you enjoyed it
like it did.

is too thin. There isn't enough entry.<br><br>The movie... skims too much of the surface. And Spader's big plan and
the finale is pretty tacked on.<br><br>The movie aspires to be a movie like ""Patriot Games"" or ""Citizen Kane.""
But everything is routine and predictable and there are precious few
new touches to this tired formula. If screenwriter Kevin Wade could've
given the script a bit more depth and discovery into these characters
and done a little more with the formula, this could have really been
something special. The cast does what it can, but inevitably, a good
cast can only take a movie so far. Still, it's worth seeing just for
Cusack turn towards the dark side and Spader as a yuppie with heart.<br><br>Oh, well...<br><br>--Filled With Personal Politics, Dane Youssef

During the summer of 1992, when I was just a young lad of 19, my
friend's mother rented TRUE COLORS, and, while I was over, she told me that
she already saw the movie and that I should watch it because she thought I
would like it. TRUE COLORS changed my life.  After watching the movie I got
pumped up to go to law school and I am now attending NEW YORK LAW
SCHOOL.
The movie has intelligent characters, a deep plot, and a powerful
message.  This movie is not like the tripe that Hollywood is pumping out on
a daily basis today, but it is more like the classic filmnoir movies of the
1940's.  This movie demonstrates that the lust for power, if unchecked,
corrupts.
That following Christmas my friend's family gave me TRUE COLORS as a
Christmas gift.  I still have it and watch it maybe around twice every few
months to remind myself why I am in law school. 
Other movies that I recommend include:  THE
FIRM, FALLING DOWN, SCARFACE, and 8mm.  <br><br>

For cinema in general, even if a story is derivative or clichÃ©d, good
writing can sometimes bolster an average or even sub-par story. Take
director Herbert Ross's ""True Colors"" staring 2 young and talented
actors of that 1991 year, John Cusack and James Spader. You can sniff
out the storyline from a mile away. It lacked surprise and is utterly
predictable. Even so, it doesn't matter because despite this, the
filmmakers and actors keep it interesting with good lead and supporting
performances, and fairly good dialog and acting. Top punchline in
dialog was the saying about ""morning dew"" - if you see the movie you'll
know. Still, there is some cheese on sound in the stodgy old 90s era
Jazz background, and the 80s materialism and hairdos. Overall though I
liked Spader and especially Cusack who were a great pairing and full of
energy. Good Movie - 7/10 Recommended.

I found this movie very entertaining because the character played by John
Cusack is somewhat of a tragic hero. Are his actions planned or
instinctive?
I just wonder whether the title refers to his character or to the one
played
by Jame Spader. Overall, the movie has a good message and always holds the
viewers attention.

Peter Burton (John Cusack) and Tim Garrity (James Spader) are waiting
for Peter's congressional election results. The movie flashes back to
University of Virginia Law School where the two best friend first met
in a fender bender. Tim is from a rich family and plans to pursue a
career in justice. His girlfriend Diana (Imogen Stubbs), the daughter
of Senator Stiles (Richard Widmark), breaks up with him. Peter is
ambitious and amoral social climber coming from a poor background. He
had an affair with Diana and even marries her. Despite that, Tim stays
as Peter's best man. Peter's rise in politics involve mob-connected
John Palmieri (Mandy Patinkin) putting him in direct conflict with Tim
who joined the Justice Department.<br><br>These are two of the best actors of their age. They do their utmost but
the story unfolds with a series of plot points. Concentrating on Peter
Burton could have made this an interesting dark movie. This has the
feel of a Brat Pack movie trying to do politics although the guys bring
it. This film is unable to build tension and lacks the intensity that
it deserves.

It's odd how some movies really resonate with you as individual but do
not necessarily have mass appeal. I think this is a sleeper, not many
people have seen it. This is one of my favourites &amp; a movie I go back
to from time to time. It's a real journey, picking Spader &amp; Cusack's
characters up as they commence college like &amp; following them for the
next 10 years or so into there respective careers &amp; personal lives.<br><br>While both are high achievers; Spader comes from a successful wealthy
family &amp; Cusack from a modest working class back ground. Consequently
there attitudes &amp; what drives them is completely different. I found
exploring both characters fascinating as there relationship is put
under enormous strain.<br><br>It's set from 1984 onwards so if you enjoy being nostalgic over that
capitalistic age, &amp; enjoyed the brat pack movies, this will help. Also
an excellent score by Michael Lang called fanfare. Hope you enjoyed it
like it did.

As a result he ended up moving around to live with various family members. He dreamed of playing pro baseball. In high school he formed a group called the St. Lunatics. The group consisted of him and some of his friends (Kyjuan, Murphy Lee, Slo Down, City Spud, and Ali) from high school. Nelly began listening to artists like Rakim, LL Cool J, Run-DMC, OutKast, Goodie Mob, and Jay-Z. He became convinced that his gift for rap could be parlayed into a career. He has his own style of rap which he likes to describe as a jazz form of hip-hop. The first song that Nelly and the St. Lunatics made was Gimmie What You Got. The song ""Gimmie What You Got"" sold 7,000 units regionally and dominated airwaves, rising to the number one spot on St. Louis\' number one hip-hop station. After that song the St. Lunatics encouraged Nelly to go solo and he did.

Her father was Dominican and her mother is Puerto Rican. She was raised in Queens, New York. When she was 10 years old, she and her family moved to the Dominican Republic where they would live for the next seven years. While living in the Dominican Republic, Zoe discovered a keen interest in performance dance and began her training at the prestigious ECOS Espacio de Danza Dance Academy where she learned ballet as well as other dance forms. Not only did her training provide an excellent outlet for the enthusiastic and energetic youngster, it would also prove to be a fortunate precursor for the start of her professional acting career. At age 17, Zoe and her family moved back to the United States where her love for dance followed and an interest in theater performance became stronger.She began performing with the Faces theater troupe which put on plays geared to provide positive messages for teens with themes dealing with issues such as substance abuse and sex. These performances not only gave her valuable experience but also a source of great pride knowing that she was making a difference in the lives of young people like herself. While performing with the Faces troupe and also the New York Youth Theater, Zoe was recruited for a talent agency and her dance training years before coupled with her acting experience greatly helped her land her first big screen role as Eva Rodriguez, the talented and headstrong ballet dancer in the film Center Stage (2000). Since her professional career began several years ago, Zoe\'s talent and determination has allowed her to be involved in blockbuster films and act with major actors, actresses and industry insiders at a pace that very few young professionals have experienced.Zoe has not only held her own in major motion picture productions but gained the respect and praise from industry insiders such as Jerry Bruckheimer and Steven Spielberg and actors/actresses such as Tom Hanks, Bernie Mac, Keira Knightley, Ashton Kutcher, Kirsten Dunst and Orlando Bloom. According to many of her co-stars, producers and directors, the sky is no limit for this young star who has incredible range, intense concentration, and a steely determination to be involved with projects that challenge her professionally with wide-ranging subject matters and characters. Just to ask practically anyone who she has worked for or with about her, glowing comments abound and earned friendships and respect are readily revealed.

Her favorite teen movie growing up was Some Kind of Wonderful.Personal Quotes (13)      When I go to the D.R., the press in Santo Domingo always asks, ""Â¿QuÃ© te consideras, dominicana o americana?"" (What do you consider yourself, Dominican or American?) I don\'t understand it, and it\'s the same people asking the same question. So I say, time and time again, ""Yo soy una mujer negra."" (""I am a black woman."") [They go] ""Oh, no, tÃº eres trigueÃ±ita."" (""Oh no, you are \'dark skinned\'"") I\'m like, ""No! Let\'s get it straight, yo soy una mujer negra."" (""I am a black woman."")      I am actually! I\'m very proud to say I am a geek. But I\'m kind of a cool geek. I grew up in a very sci-fi home so I\'ve seen a lot of sci-fi movies, from Dune (1984) to Alien (1979), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), *batteries not included (1987)... All these films I go crazy for. But never ""Star Trek"".      I tend to be very picky, so I look for the perfect man! So if Spock and Kirk can mix, they\'d become my perfect man. That\'s the kind of guy I\'d go for. I don\'t only go for muscles, I don\'t only go for brains. You just need to have a little bit of a bad boy and a geek and then you\'ve got the perfect guy.      [on auditioning for Avatar (2009)] I was still living in New York at the time, and I heard that James Cameron was getting ready to shoot a movie. At first, I thought it was going to be that Japanese franchise that he owns; I read for that and it disappeared. Then, like a month later, they want to put me back on tape... the script excerpts used for auditions were about this girl from a tribe in the jungle and I was like, this is weird. But I put myself on tape again and, a month later, around July 2006, they called me and told me that in a week, I was going to L.A. to meet James Cameron. I remember being very nervous, but he was just such a polite and approachable person. It felt like a meeting where we were getting to know each other, as opposed to an audition, where I have to put my act on.      [on the current landscape of quality roles for actresses] They\'re out there - people just aren\'t investing in them. We can sit here forever discussing it, because it has a chicken vs. the egg quality. Bottom line, producers are business people. Hollywood is a moneymaking machine. At the end of the day, they have to produce numbers that will help them keep their jobs and companies alive. But we as consumers have a lot more power than we think. Women need to demand better roles and get audiences to see their films. Because if a film doesn\'t make $150 million, producers and studios aren\'t going to bankroll a similar film next time. If there were more filmmakers that were female, trust me, it would be all about women.      [on James Cameron creating strong female characters] I don\'t know if its something that he\'s been consciously aware of, to be honest. What do know is that he\'s been impacted by interesting women all his life, because you can tell he\'s in tune with his feminine side. I\'ve learned this about men who write good roles for women - there\'s a very beautiful sentimentality to them. Their exteriors are sugarcoated with this manly presence, but deep on the inside, there\'s also this [fragility]. During the shortness of my career, I\'ve managed to work with Steven Spielberg, J.J. Abrams, and now Jim - all directors who are known for having strong female protagonists. They don\'t feel diminished by it as men; they can tap into the complexities of how woman really are.      ... I will say is that my Avatar (2009) character, Neytiri, has been the most challenging of my entire career - physically, mentally and spiritually. It\'s the first time I played a non-human, I had to learn a different language, and it was hard to part with her at the end. No matter how intense other characters have been, I\'ve only been in their skins for at most four months - never a year and a half.      I love sex. I love skin. I don\'t believe the body is something to hide. I think in American society we\'re messing up our kids by taking away the education on, and awareness of, our sexuality and replacing it with violence, guns and video games - and we\'re breeding little criminals.      [on her dislike of making Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)] I didn\'t like the experience of working on Pirates and I feel that it is my job to be completely honest. To me, that\'s what a Hollywood movie felt like. If that\'s what I have to witness, and have to go through, to do a Hollywood movie, I\'d rather do something else. It was just too massive. You really felt the immensity of it. Just not my taste.      [on expanding her career to become a film director] It is more satisfying. You are more of a participant in the conception. I like having control. I think I have the capability. I am a storyteller and an artist and I love what I do. So I want to be part of it more and not just show up and say my lines.      When you are shooting a film like Blood Ties (2013), when the budget is not as big and you are shooting in a city like New York, which is a very expensive city, all the budget goes into the movie and you just make compromises. You are happy to do so because you are collaborating with amazing people. It is a good day at the office. The office might be smaller but it is good.

This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It explains how
hard life can be when u hit the big time and also talks about what
would happen if a fan was in a situation when he had to kill his idol?
Nelly was amazing in this movie, proving that he can rap but he is an
amazing actor as well. I think this movie was also a very touching
story(especially at the end of the movie). To tell u the truth I was
crying, I not going to lie. Also ladies, if u wanna see a bunch of hot
guyz then this is the best movie for u. It of course has Nelly in it
and a bunch of other hot playaz. There is something for the men too.
There is a woman in the movie , Cheryl, acted by Zoe Saldana. She looks
good for all them men.lol.Well if u want to see a hot movie that is a
drama, action, and a love story, this is the movie for u to see.

OMG, I LOVED this movie!!!!! I happen to catch it on VH1 last night and I
stayed up until 1:30am to make sure I saw the end of it. At first I was
somewhat skeptical about how good it would be, but as the movie went on,
it
just got better and better and I knew that I had to watch the whole thing.
I
plan on finding it on DVD soon so that I can let all my friends see it. I
don't want to give away the plot to people who hasn't seen it, but I will
say that this is a wonderful, well-acted, never boring movie. I loved the
actor who plated Erik, he has talent and I hope to see him in more movies.
So if you can, please see this movie. But beware there is a lot of
violence,
but not so much that you can't enjoy it.

Finally a thriller with a twist after twist. 
Rap and hip-hop provide more than background music, they're central to the

Smart script and excellent thriller overall.
'Nelly' is certainly more than a rapper. He's is star on the big screen
too.

To me Snipes has one of the best plots I've seen in a movie. The action
never stops and you can never once guess what will happen next. There
is always another twist. Dean Winters is a great evil villain and he
really makes you hate him. Zoe Saldana is gorgeous as always and a very
good actress. Seeing Nelly in it was interesting but he played a part
anyone could of played so I'm pretty impartial to his performance. Not
bad but not amazing. This is a movie that never gets talked about or
anything, and I'm surprised. It's one of my favorites and I recommend
it to anyone who likes thrillers, gangster movies, crime dramas, and
even rap movies.

                    Vincent Lamarca, whose father was executed for a 1950s kidnapping of a child, grew up to become a police officer, only to see his own son become a murderer.
            ","

New York City homicide detective Vincent LaMarca has forged a long and distinguished career in law enforcement, making a name for himself as a man intensely committed to his work. But on his latest case, the stakes are higher for Vincent--the suspect he's investigating is his own son. He and Joey have been painfully estranged ever since Vincent divorced his wife and left the decaying boardwalks of Long Beach, Long Island for the anonymity of Manhattan and a successful career with the NYPD. He lives his life in solitude, keeping his girlfriend at arm's length; the closest relationship he maintains is with his partner, Reg--and Vincent makes sure that stops at the precinct door. As long as Vincent lives in the protection of the present, he doesn't have to deal with the pain of his past--or his sorrow over his broken relationship with Joey. But this murder investigation is drawing Vincent home to Long Beach, the self-proclaimed City by the Sea, where the past has been waiting for him to ...                Written by

In 1999, the couple renewed marriage vows at their Ulster County farm in New York\'s Catskill Mountains, but later that year De Niro filed for divorce. Their fallout continued into 2001 as a potential custody battle over their son, Elliott, heated up. However, the divorce was never finalized and they managed to smooth over their troubles. Their second child was born in December 2011 via surrogate.      When he was a child, he was an avid reader of playwrights.      Growing up in the Little Italy section of New York City, his nickname was ""Bobby Milk"" because he was so thin and as pale as milk.      Turned down the role of Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988). Was considered for the role of Josh Baskin in Penny Marshall\'s Big (1988). Was offered but turned down the role of Sal the pizza shop owner in Do the Right Thing (1989).      Son of painter Virginia Admiral and abstract expressionist Robert De Niro Sr.. Despite being raised Presbyterian, Virginia was an atheist for most of Robert\'s childhood. Robert Sr was raised Catholic but was not religious in any way. After De Niro was born, his father Robert Sr came out as a homosexual and eventually divorced Robert\'s mother.      He formed his own production company, Tribeca Film Center (1989).      In his 1980 Oscar acceptance speech, he thanked Joey LaMotta (brother of Jake LaMotta), who was at the time suing United Artists for the portrayal of him in Raging Bull (1980).      After being caught up in a Paris prostitution ring investigation, he, denying any involvement, vowed never to return to France again (1998).      Although he is sometimes referred to as an Italian-American actor, De Niro is actually one quarter Italian in ancestry. His father was of half Italian and half Irish descent. His mother was of Dutch, English, German, French and Irish ancestry on her own father\'s side, and of German ancestry on her own mother\'s side. Robert was quite close to his Italian paternal grandfather, whom he visited frequently in Syracuse, New York when he was young. De Niro has stated that he identifies ""more with [his] Italian side"". He was inducted into the Italian-American Hall of Fame in 2002.      He is the second actor to receive an Academy Award for portraying Vito Corleone. He and Marlon Brando are the only two actors to receive an Academy Award for playing the same character.      He first discovered his love for acting at age 10 when he portrayed the Cowardly Lion in a local production of ""The Wizard of Oz"". He dropped out of high school to join a gang.      Formerly held the World Record for Most Weight Gained for a Movie, in gaining over 60 pounds for his role in Raging Bull (1980). But seven years later, Vincent D\'Onofrio eclipsed him in gaining 70 pounds for his role in Full Metal Jacket (1987).      Three movies (at least) that De Niro has appeared in have the song ""Gimme Shelter"" by The Rolling Stones noticeably featured in the soundtrack: Goodfellas (1990), Casino (1995) and The Fan (1996).      Ranked #78 in Premiere magazine\'s 2002 annual Power 100 List.      In 1993, he was tapped to star as Enzo Ferrari in the film ""Ferrari"", which was budgeted at $65 million (U.S.) and had Michael Mann attached as director. The project fell through.      He organized the first Tribeca Film Festival in May 2002. He intended to revitalize the Lower Manhattan area after the September 11 attacks.      Has said that Meryl Streep is his favorite actress to work with.      He was voted as the best actor of all time at FilmFour.com (2002).      In 1984, British pop group Bananarama had a song dedicated to him called ""Robert De Niro\'s Waiting"". De Niro heard about this and arranged to meet the three girls, but they got so nervous, while waiting for him, that they got drunk before he even arrived.      Diagnosed with prostate cancer, and expected to make a full recovery. [October 2003]      Spent four months learning to speak the Sicilian dialect in order to play Vito Corleone in The Godfather: Part II (1974). Nearly all the dialogue that his character spoke in the movie was in Sicilian.      According to a profile in Vanity Fair\'s annual Hollywood issue, is the first actor to do a method interpretation of a cartoon character as Fearless Leader in The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle (2000).      He started the whole ""awards show ribbon"" tradition by wearing a green ribbon on his lapel at the 1981 Academy Awards. The ribbon was in rememberance of several African-American children who were victims of a serial killer in Atlanta, Georgia in 1980-1981. The ribbon was given to him by a fan in the bleachers as he arrived; the victims\' families had been wearing them for months.      Was in Ossining, New York (home of the infamous Sing Sing penitentiary) to shoot three different movies: Analyze This (1999), Analyze That (2002) and Hide and Seek (2005).      In the Egyptian film El Medina (1999), the main actor Ali has a duck that he named De Niro after his favorite actor.      Was voted the No. #2 greatest movie star of all time in a Channel 4 (UK) poll, narrowly being beaten by Al Pacino.      This was tricky to make him look huge as Frankenstein\'s monster in Mary Shelley\'s Frankenstein (1994) , considering that Kenneth Branagh, who played Dr. Frankenstein, is of similar height. Many of the tricks used to make humans, wizards and elves dwarf the hobbits later on for the Lord of the Rings trilogy were also employed to make De Niro appear much bigger than his co-stars, including using very large men as body doubles for shots where only the hands and feet are seen.      He was voted the 34th Greatest Movie Star of all time by Entertainment Weekly.      Singer PJ Harvey refers to De Niro in a song, ""Reeling"", from her album ""4-Track Demos"".Finley Quaye mentions him in the song ""Sunday Shining"", in the line ""I\'m a hero like Robert De Niro"".      Was unable to accept his first Academy Award in 1975 due to filming commitments to Bernardo Bertolucci\'s Novecento (1976).      Was good friends with comedian John Belushi, who died of a drug overdose on March 5, 1982. In fact, De Niro and Robin Williams were the last stars to see Belushi alive, albeit on separate visits to Bungalow #3 of L.A.\'s Chateau Marmont hotel that fateful day. De Niro visited Belushi at 3:00 am on the morning of his death, but, according to eyewitnesses, left minutes later after seeing that Belushi was sick. Less than an hour earlier, Belushi had been visited by Robin Williams, who also left straight away.      Ranked #1 in Empire (UK) magazine\'s ""The Greatest Living Actor (Gods Among Us)"" list. [October 2004]      At age 17, after leaving the movies with a friend, he unexpectedly stated that he was going to be a film actor. No one believed him until he dropped out of his senior year of high school and joined Stella Adler\'s acting school.      His boyhood idols among actors included Montgomery Clift, Robert Mitchum and Marlon Brando. He preferred the darker, more character-driven work of these men to the older stars of Hollywood, for whom their public persona as a star was more important than their immersion into the character.      Rarely does interviews and is known as one of the most ultra-private celebrities. He was the subject of a late 1990s interview (and cover photo) for Esquire magazine. Most of the article focused on how guarded he is with his personal life, what few details are known about him, what rumors are speculated while only a minority of the article dealt with the actual interview itself. The writer noted that while the interview was ultimately agreed upon, he was given a substantial list of off-limit subjects not to ask De Niro about. They included: politics, religion, his family, his reported interest in fine wines, and so on.      When they met shortly before making Mean Streets (1973) De Niro and Harvey Keitel became fast friends. De Niro was from Greenwich Village in Manhattan and was taught by Stella Adler and Keitel was from the Brighton Beach area of Brooklyn and was mainly mentored by Lee Strasberg. But the two guarded actors bonded and remain close to this day.      He and Martin Scorsese were brought up blocks apart in the Greenwich Village area of Manhattan, but never formally met when they were young. When introduced at a party in 1972, the two came to realize that they had seen each other many times but had never spoken.      Limo drivers in Los Angeles joke about his less than generous tips by referring to him as ""No Dinero"".      Very good friends with Joe Pesci.

Was offered the role of Dick Tracy in Dick Tracy (1990), which went to Warren Beatty.      Turned down the role of Tony D\'Amato in Any Given Sunday (1999), which went to Al Pacino.      Passed up the opportunity to play Frank Costello in The Departed (2006) to work on his second directorial feature The Good Shepherd (2006).      After Once Upon a Time in America (1984), director Sergio Leone planning to cast De Niro in a film he was working on about the siege of Leningrad in World War II, but that project never came about due to Leone\'s death in 1989.      For the role of Max Cady in Cape Fear (1991), he paid a dentist $5,000 to make his teeth look suitably bad. After filming, he paid $20,000 to have them fixed. For this film, he was tattooed with vegetable dyes, which faded after a few months.      Accidentally broke a rib of Joe Pesci in a sparring scene in Raging Bull (1980). This shot appears in the film: De Niro hits Pesci in the side, Pesci groans, and there is a quick cut to another angle.      Mentioned in \'Weird Al\' Yankovic\'s song, ""Frank\'s 2000 TV"".      Owns residences on the east and west sides of Manhattan as well as near Marbletown, New York.

He based the movement of his character Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver (1976) on that of a crab. He thought the character was indirect and tended to shift from side to side.      He visited Michael Jackson on the set of filming the ""Smooth Criminal"" segment for Moonwalker (1988). Also visiting the set was Gregory Peck, and Bruce Willis.      Was cited as one of the most promising movie personalities of 1973 in John Willis\' 1974 Film Annual ""Screen World"" book.      One of the five winners of the 2009 Kennedy Center Honors.

[January 2011]      Unlike Marlon Brando, who preceded him as Don Vito Corleone, he actually has Italian ancestry in his background. He and Brando both have Dutch ancestry.      He was originally cast in the role of Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York (2002), but pulled out when he discovered this would mean spending six months in Europe and was replaced by Daniel Day-Lewis.      Was considered for the role of Harry Line in Home Alone (1990), which went to his good friend Joe Pesci.      Is an only child.      Is mentioned in Billy Bragg\'s 1991 song ""Sexuality"".      President of the jury at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.      The longest he has gone without an Oscar nomination is 21 years, between Cape Fear (1991) and Silver Linings Playbook (2012).

Of those, The Godfather: Part II (1974) and The Deer Hunter (1978) are winners in the category.The Godfather (1972) predicts both of his Oscar-winning roles. In a scene with Vito Corleone, a poster advertising a Jake LaMotta fight can be seen.      He and his close friend GÃ©rard Depardieu have both received Oscar nominations for playing a role that had already earned an Oscar for another actor. DeNiro won his first Oscar for playing Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather: Part II (1974), a role previously played by Marlon Brando. Depardieu was nominated for Cyrano de Bergerac (1990), a role that previously won an Oscar for JosÃ© Ferrer.      Read the book Raging Bull (1980) while filming The Godfather: Part II (1974). His roles in both films would win him an Academy Award.      Has played characters that are Vietnam veterans on five occasions: Taxi Driver (1976), The Deer Hunter (1978), Jacknife (1989), Meet the Parents trilogy, and Grudge Match (2013).      Was considered for the role of Howard Payne in Speed (1994), which went to Dennis Hopper instead.      Before Martin Scorsese was hired to direct Taxi Driver (1976), others considered for the role of Travis Bickle were Jeff Bridges, Jack Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman, Warren Beatty, Burt Reynolds, Ryan O\'Neal, Peter Fonda, Al Pacino, Jon Voight, Robert Blake, David Carradine, Richard Dreyfuss, Christopher Walken, Alain Delon, James Caan, Roy Scheider, Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen, Elliott Gould, Alan Alda, Neil Diamond, George Hamilton, Charles Grodin and Kris Kristofferson.      In the 1950s, Robert lived with his mother in the top floor apartment at 219 West 14th Street in Manhattan\'s ""Little Spain"".      He was offered the roles of Captain Robert Stout and Staff Sergeant Eddie Dohun in A Bridge Too Far (1977) but turned both down. Elliott Gould and James Caan were cast respectively.      Walked out of a Radio Times interview after saying the journalist was asking him questions with a ""negative inference"".      He gained 60 pounds for a single scene playing an older Jake La Motta in Raging Bull (1980).      There is a ""De Niro Men\'s Clothing Shop"" in Chengdu, China.      Turned down the role of Hopper in A Bug\'s Life (1998), which went to Kevin Spacey.      Was considered for the role of Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man 2 (2004), which went to Alfred Molina.      Has worked with eight directors who have won an Oscar for Best Director: Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Bernardo Bertolucci, Elia Kazan, Michael Cimino, Ron Howard, Barry Levinson and Alfonso CuarÃ³n.      Was offered the role of Mitch Leary in In the Line of Fire (1993), but had to turn down due to scheduling conflicts with A Bronx Tale (1993). The role went to John Malkovich.      Longtime friend/fan and confidant of Whoopi Goldberg.      Prefers making movies to acting on stage.      He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\'s highest civilian award, by President Barack Obama, in a live televised ceremony held in the East Room of the White House, on November 22, 2016, along with twenty other recipients, the the largest, and final Medal of Freedom ceremony of Obama\'s presidency. At this ceremony, the twenty-one recipients, in alphabetical order, included: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Elouise Cobell (posthumous award given to her son), Ellen DeGeneres, Robert De Niro, Richard Garwin, Bill Gates, Melinda Gates, Frank Gehry, Margaret Hamilton (as Margaret H. Hamilton), Tom Hanks, Rear Admiral Grace Hopper (posthumous award given to her niece), Michael Jordan, Maya Lin, Lorne Michaels, Newton Minow, Eduardo Padron (as Eduardo PadrÃ³n), Robert Redford, Diana Ross, Vin Scully, Bruce Springsteen and Cicely Tyson.      He was the one who first made Martin Scorsese aware of Leonardo DiCaprio. He had worked with DiCaprio on This Boy\'s Life (1993) and had been very impressed by his talent and spoke about him to his friend and frequent collaborator. Scorsese and DiCaprio would later work together on many films.      De Niro revealed in March 2016, that his son Elliot is autistic.      In an interview with Total Film magazine in 2007, he praised Eddie Redmayne, whom he directed and starred with in The Good Shepherd (2006), when asked about younger actors whom he liked.Personal Quotes (55)      The talent is in the choices.      It\'s important not to indicate. People don\'t try to show their feelings, they try to hide them.      I don\'t like to watch my own movies - I fall asleep in my own movies.      Don\'t talk it [shooting a scene] away, do it!      Some people say that drama is easy, and comedy is hard. Not true. I\'ve been making comedies the last couple of years, and it\'s nice. When you make a drama, you spend all day beating a guy to death with a hammer, or what have you. Or you have to take a bite out of somebody\'s face. On the other hand, with a comedy, you yell at Billy Crystal for an hour, and you go home.      [interview in Chicago Sun Times, 1/8/98] I think Hollywood has a class system. The actors are like the inmates, but the truth is they\'re running the asylum. You\'ve got to look at the whole studio structure. There\'s these guys. We call them suits. They have the power to okay a film. They\'re like your parents, going, ""We have the money"". But at the same time they say to us actors, ""We love you. We can\'t do without you"". You know, I\'ve been around a long time. I\'ve seen the suits run the asylum. I think I can do it as good or even better. Let me try it. That\'s why I have TriBeCa.      I go to Paris, I go to London, I go to Rome, and I always say, ""There\'s no place like New York. It\'s the most exciting city in the world now. That\'s the way it is. That\'s it.""      I\'ve never been one of those actors who has touted myself as a fascinating human being. I had to decide early on wether I was to be an actor or a personality.      [on acting] The whole thing is for younger people who are sexy and youthful.      [on the mobster characters he often plays] The characters that I play are real. They are real so they have as much right to be portrayed as any other characters. There are other characters I have played, other than those ones that have been called stereotypes or whatever. So.      People treat me with a bit too much reverence. Look at Dustin Hoffman. I always envy the way he can speak and be smart and funny and so on. I just can\'t do that.      [about Al Pacino] Al, over the years we\'ve taken roles from one another. People have tried to compare us to one another, to pit us against one another and to tear us apart personally. I\'ve never seen the comparison frankly. I\'m clearly much taller, more the leading-man type. Honestly, you just may be the finest actor of our generation - with the possible exception of me.      One of the things about acting is it allows you to live other people\'s lives without having to pay the price.      I am part Italian, I\'m not all Italian. I\'m part Dutch, I\'m part French, I\'m part German, I\'m part Irish. But my name is Italian and I probably identify more with my Italian side than with my other parts.      If there is a God he has a lot to answer for.      You\'ll have time to rest when you\'re dead.      After my first movies, I gave interviews. Then I thought, ""What\'s so important about where I went to school, and hobbies? . . . what does any of that have to do with acting, with my own head?""      There is a mixture of anarchy and discipline in the way I work.      [in 2004] I love Italy and I have a deep tie with my Italian roots. I stand for [John Kerry]. I hope he will arrive at the White House. We need a different government to represent America. The change of presidency would be a clear and international sign to say that we are approaching again to the rest of the world. I don\'t want any prize that can influence this election. I stand for Kerry.      (on Taxi Driver (1976)\'s infamous line) You have no idea that, years later, people in cars will recognize you on the street and shout, ""You talkin\' to me?"" I don\'t remember the original script, but I don\'t think the line was in it. We improvised. For some reason it touched a nerve. That happens.      Some people say, ""New York\'s a great place to visit, but I wouldn\'t want to live there"". I say that about other places.      It\'s true: I spent lunchtime in a grave during the filming of Bloody Mama (1970). When you\'re younger, you feel that\'s what you need to do to help you stay in character. When you get older, you become more confident and less intense about it -- and you can achieve the same effect. You might even be able to achieve more if you take your mind off it, because you\'re relaxed. That\'s the key to it all. When you\'re relaxed and confident, you get good stuff.      Movies are hard work. The public doesn\'t see that. The critics don\'t see it. But they\'re a lot of work. A lot of work. When I\'m directing a great dramatic scene, part of me is saying, ""Thank God I don\'t have to do that"". Because I know how fucking hard it is to act. It\'s the middle of the night. It\'s freezing. You gotta do this scene. You gotta get it up to get to that point. And yet, as a director, you\'ve got to get the actors to that point. It\'s hard either way.      When I was a teenager, I went to the Dramatic Workshop at the New School. The school had a lot of actors under the GI Bill -- \'Rod Steiger\', Harry Belafonte, the generation ahead of me. I went in there and the director said to me, ""Vy do you vant to be an acteh?"" I didn\'t know how to answer, so I didn\'t say anything. And he said, ""To express yourself!"" And I said, ""Yeah, yeah, that\'s it. That\'s right.""      [on witnessing the terrorist attack on New York on 9/11/2001] I left a meeting right after they hit the World Trade Center. I went to my apartment, which looks south, and I watched it out my window. I could see the line of fire across the North Tower. I had my binoculars and a video camera--though I didn\'t want to video it. I saw a few people jump. Then I saw the South Tower go. It was so unreal, I had to confirm it by immediately looking at the television screen. CNN was on. That was the only way to make it real. Like my son said: ""It was like watching the moon fall"".      The hardest thing about being famous is that people are always nice to you. You\'re in a conversation and everybody\'s agreeing with what you\'re saying -- even if you say something totally crazy. You need people who can tell you what you don\'t want to hear.      I didn\'t have a problem with rejection, because when you go into an audition, you\'re rejected already. There are hundreds of other actors. You\'re behind the eight ball when you go in there. At this point in my career, I don\'t have to deal with audition rejections. So I get my rejection from other things. My children can make me feel rejected. They can humble you pretty quick.      Money makes your life easier. If you\'re lucky to have it, you\'re lucky.      I only go to Los Angeles when I am paid for it.      Nobody has moved me from my seat yet. But, just in case, I\'ve bought my own restaurants.      [on What Just Happened (2008)] This is as close as it gets to what it can be like to be in the middle of this stuff. The fear factor is always there--everything from losing tens of millions of dollars on a film that doesn\'t work to not being able to get a good table in a top restaurant because your last movie flopped.      It is good to have a few other interests [restaurants, hotels, the TriBeca Film Festival]. But my main interest has always been movies - making them, directing them, being involved. I have never lost the passion for that.      I like New York because I can still walk the streets and sit down in a bar or restaurant and observe people. If you can\'t properly observe, as an actor, you\'re finished. The impression sometimes given is that I can\'t leave my own home without being recognised or bothered in the street. That\'s just not true. I can go out, at leisure, meet people for lunch or take my kids to the park. I don\'t think I am glamorous enough for Hollywood.      I have lived in Los Angeles, working in Hollywood, countless times, doing movies. I am not against the place. I was not a young actor kicking around, living by the seat of my pants, desperate for work. I went by invitation, and my experiences have been good ones. But I have never chosen to live there full-time.      I\'ve always done comedies. There were comic elements in Mean Streets (1973) and even Taxi Driver (1976). And I did The King of Comedy (1982). I\'ve always had what I consider to be a good sense of humour. There is this image that has been built up - invented, more like - and there\'s me, living the life. I do not consider myself some sort of acting legend, just an actor doing his best with the material that is there at the time.      You can look into my background all you like, but I have never had problems with authority on film sets. Even if I disagree with a director, I work through it. I am also not one for regrets. I don\'t regret any film I\'ve made, because there was a reason for making it at the time. If it hasn\'t worked out, then don\'t spend time worrying about why and how. Just move on to the next project.      Difficult? Me? I don\'t think I am difficult compared to other people. It is hard to make a movie at the best of times, so you don\'t want to give people a hard time. People all have their own agendas. But it is not worth acting out something from your own history to make a point on a film set. If you have a problem with, say, your father or some other father figure, why give the director a tough time?      [on Martin Scorsese] I wish I had that knowledge of movies that he has. He\'s like an encyclopedia. I could call him up and ask him about a certain movie, and he would know about it. He\'s seen everything, it\'s great.      (on the lengths he will go to disappear into a part) You don\'t just play a part. You\'ve got to earn the right to play them.      [on Martin Scorsese] I really hope I get to do another movie with him again.      [re Angelina Jolie and Helen Mirren] She [Jolie] is my dream co-star and I love to work with her. It depends on the project [as to who would be] at the top of my list... wonderful actresses.      I always wanted to direct. Directing is a lot more of a commitment though, a lot more time. I like directors who do very few takes, they know what they want. As for me, I know when I have a shot, but I might want back up, and one other take. You never know. If it\'s about capturing a moment, you\'re never going to be able to go back and repeat it, you go with it. It\'s a tricky thing. I go through all the footage, and look at everything.      Some things you learn from just being in movies, so I see what\'s getting done, how it\'s getting done. I know what making a film is going to take, how much time. I almost don\'t even think about it. If I\'m in a movie, I can sense if something is not quite right, if the rhythm is off.      I know it\'s important to give everybody as much freedom as you can so that they don\'t feel there are any limitations. With any mistake they could make, everything is fine. And then they\'re not afraid to try things or trust you when you say, ""Look, let\'s try and go in this direction."" That\'s very important with actors - and all other creative elements.      [on being cast in The Deer Hunter (1978)] I talked with the millworkers, drank and ate with them, played pool. I tried to become as close to being a steelworker as possible, and I would have worked a shift at the mill but they wouldn\'t let me.      I just can\'t fake acting. I know movies are an illusion, and maybe the first rule is to fake it, but not for me. I\'m too curious. I want to deal with all the facts of the character, thin or fat.      [on release of restored version of The King of Comedy (1982) in 2013] I was a big fan of the script and was very excited to do it with Marty [Scorsese] and happy that we finally made it. The fact that it\'s been restored (hard to believe that so many years have passed) is even all the better, and I can\'t wait to see it on our closing night.      The first time I went to Vegas, I was 17. I had a friend who was a dealer in a casino. It was real desert, still like the Wild West. Apparently, there\'s a nightclub scene now. Back then, you gambled and then, at 4am, you went to the lounges to see Sinatra sing.      When you\'re directing, you think of everything ... The few times I\'ve directed, if someone comes up with something you missed, you\'re glad to hear that.      I\'m hoping that if things work out with digital technology, they can finally make us look younger and I can go on for another 40 years.      [on the death of his Flawless (1999) co-star Philip Seymour Hoffman] I\'m very, very saddened by the passing of Phil. He was a wonderful actor. This is one of those times where you say, \'This just shouldn\'t be. He was so young and gifted and had so much going, so much to live for.\' My family and I send our deepest condolences to his family.      [on theatre] I like movies. I mean, I\'d do a play if I could find a great play, a modern play, a new play. But you can do more with film. I like the illusion. In like that you can create something and do it over and then put it together like a big puzzle. With a play, the most you can do is videotape it once and then put it in the archive at the Lincoln Center. Films last. You put it on the screen and it\'s there forever, a little piece of history.      [on the cast reunion for the 25th anniversary of Goodfellas (1990)] We sometimes run into each other. What happens is, you see each other 10 or 15 years later, and it is as if the time has not passed. Because we got to know each other so well at an emotional or spiritual level; and it never goes away.      [referring to Donald J. Trump] I mean he\'s so blatantly stupid. He\'s a punk, he\'s a dog, he\'s a pig, he\'s a con, he\'s a mutt who doesn\'t know what he\'s talking about, he doesn\'t do his homework, doesn\'t care, thinks he\'s gaming his society, doesn\'t pay his taxes, he\'s an idiot. Colin Powell said it best, he\'s a national disaster. He\'s an embarrassment to this country. It makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool, this bozo has wound up where he has. He talks how he wants to punch people in the face, well I\'d like to punch him in the face. This is somebody we want for president? I don\'t think so. What I care about is the direction of this country, and what I\'m very, very worried about is that it might go in the wrong direction with someone like Donald J. Trump.      [on Donald J. Trump] I said that because he said that about somebody, that he would like to punch them in the face. How dare he say that to the crowd? How dare he say the things he does? Of course I want to punch him in the face. It was only a symbolic thing, anyway. It wasn\'t like I was going to go find him and punch him in the face. But he\'s got to hear it. He\'s got to hear that, you know, that\'s how he makes people feel. It\'s not good to feel that way. It\'s not good to start that stuff up, but at the same time sometimes when people are bullies like that, that\'s what you have to do to shut them up.

She was adopted by Canadian-born parents Noreen Eloise (Nickleson), a nurse from Ontario, and Vernon Weir McDormand, a minister from Nova Scotia, who raised her in the suburbs of Pittsburgh. She earned her B.A. in Theater from Bethany College in 1979 and her MFA from Yale in 1982. Her career after graduation began onstage, and she has retained her association with the theater throughout her career. She soon obtained prominent roles in movies as well, first starring in Blood Simple. (1984), in which she worked with filmmaker Joel Coen, whom she married that year. She frequently collaborated with Coen and his brother Ethan Coen in their films.McDormand\'s skilled and versatile acting has been recognized by both the critics and the Academy and, in addition to many critics\' awards, she has been nominated for an Academy Award four times - for Mississippi Burning (1988), Fargo (1996) (for which she won the Best Actress Award), Almost Famous (2000) and North Country (2005). Keenly intelligent and possessed of a sharp wit, McDormand is the antithesis of the Hollywood starlet - rather than making every role about Frances McDormand, Frances McDormand dissolves into the characters she plays. Accordingly, she has expressed some reservations about the iconic recognition she has gained from her touching and amusing portrayal of Police Chief Marge Gunderson, the quintessential Minnesota Scandinavian, in Fargo (1996).McDormand and Coen adopted a son, Pedro, who was born in Paraguay, in 1994. They live in Manhattan, New York.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Larry-115          Spouse (1) Joel Coen (1 April\xa01984            - present)\xa0(1 child)          Trivia (21)      Has one son, Pedro McDormand Coen, adopted from Paraguay in 1994.

On playing \'mothers\': ""Those roles weren\'t just mothers in a story about a male protagonist. First they were specific, three-dimensional people.""      On ""women\'s pictures"": ""Most women\'s pictures are as boring and as formulaic as men\'s pictures. In place of a car chase or a battle scene, what you get is an extreme closeup of a woman breaking down. I cry too, maybe three times a week, but it\'s not in closeup. It\'s a wide shot. It\'s in the context of a very large and very mean world.""      I\'m a character actress, plain and simple...Who can worry about a career? Have a life. Movie stars have careers - actors work, and then they don\'t work, and then they work again.      With most people when there\'s a pain in their life there\'s mental scar tissue that forms over the pain and helps you go on living. An actor\'s scar tissue really never covers over things the same way, not if you\'re going to be sensitive. With good technique, an actor can do that and walk through life without going insane.      You have to get away from the theater or from the set and live life. If you work constantly from job to job, you\'re living in a fantasy world and you have nothing else to offer than fantasy.      I don\'t like award shows. At our house we call this time of year \'the convention\'. It\'s too bad we haven\'t figured out how to stop it. But I think it will come around because of the Internet - I think it will naturally go away. We\'ll have other ways to gather; it\'s not going to be this stuff. The shoes hurt too much.      I\'ve got a rubber face. It has always served me very well and really helps, especially as I get older, because I still have all my road map intact, and I can use it at will.      [on plastic surgery] I have not mutated myself in any way. Joel (Coen, her director husband) and I have this conversation a lot.

His mother, Betsy Franco, is Jewish, and his father, Douglas Eugene ""Doug"" Franco, was of Portuguese and Swedish descent, and ran a Silicon Valley business. James\'s mother, a writer, has occasionally acted.Growing up with his two younger brothers, Dave Franco, also an actor, and Tom Franco, James graduated from Palo Alto High School in 1996 and went on to attend UCLA, majoring in English. To overcome his shyness, he got into acting while studying there, which, much to his parents\' dismay, he left after only one year. After fifteen months of intensive study at Robert Carnegie\'s Playhouse West, James began actively pursuing his dream of finding work as an actor in Hollywood. In that short time, he landed himself a starring role on Freaks and Geeks (1999). The show, however, was not a hit to its viewers at the time, and was canceled after its first year. Now, it has become a cult-hit. Prior to joining Freaks and Geeks (1999), Franco starred in the TV miniseries To Serve and Protect (1999). After that, he had a starring role in Whatever It Takes (2000).Although he\'d been working steadily, it wasn\'t until the TNT made-for-television movie, James Dean (2001) that James rose to fan-magazine fame and got to show off his talent. Since then, he has been working non-stop. After losing the lead role to Tobey Maguire, James settled for the part of ""Harry Osborne"", Spider-Man\'s best friend in the summer 2002 major hit Spider-Man (2002). He returned to the Osborne role for the next two films in the trilogy.Next was Deuces Wild (2002) and City by the Sea (2002), in which Robert De Niro personally had him cast, after viewing his performance in James Dean (2001). He was recently seen in David Gordon Green\'s Pineapple Express (2008) opposite Seth Rogen, in George C. Wolfe\'s Nights in Rodanthe (2008), starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane and in Paul Haggis\' In the Valley of Elah (2007), starring Tommy Lee Jones. Also starring opposite Sean Penn in Gus Van Sant\'s Milk (2008) in which his performance earned him an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor.

James appeared in two movies that premiered on the same day, Deuces Wild (2002) and Spider-Man (2002), both opening on May 3rd. The success of the two films was highly varied as Spider-Man film has to date amassed a box office gross some 67 times greater than that of Deuces.

James\'s mother is from an Ashkenazi Jewish family (from Russia, Germany, Poland, and Lithuania).

Franco told interviewer Terry Gross that when he was in junior high school, he was arrested for shoplifting cologne from a department store and reselling it with his friends at the school. He noted to Gross the irony that, in 2008, he shot an advertising campaign in which he became the face of Gucci cologne.      While a guest on her NPR program ""Fresh Air"", Franco told interviewer Terry Gross that when he went back to UCLA to finish his undergraduate degree in creative writing, he was worried that his classmates and professors might think of him as ""sliding by"" because of his acting career, so he took a lot of extra courses to make sure they knew he was serious. He told Gross that the cap on the number of units that a student is allowed to take in a quarter was 19, but in his last quarter he took 62 units - which as far as he knows is a record for a single student.      In 2009, he reunited with his Deuces Wild (2002) co-star, Ronnie Marmo, on General Hospital (1963).      Franco\'s creative writing professors have included such major figures as Amy Hempel, Mona Simpson, Jonathan Lethem, Gary Shteyngart and Michael Cunningham.

He is continuing further degree studies while also teaching a graduate class that takes students through the process of making a feature-length film. (2011).

His favorite film of 2015 was Mustang (2015). [Indiewiere, Nov.19 2015].      In October 2015, James Franco had a Bar Mitzvah, the Jewish coming-of-age ceremony traditionally celebrated at age 13. A rabbi, of the Reform Jewish denomination, presided over the ceremony, in which Franco, wearing a traditional prayer shawl and yarmulke, read from the Torah in Hebrew. Franco was 37 at the time of his Bar Mitzvah; though they are most often celebrated at 13, a Bar Mitzvah may be observed any time after 13, as well. The Bar Mitzvah was orchestrated by Franco\'s friend, Seth Rogen, as a fundraiser for Rogen\'s Alzheimer\'s research charity, ""Hilarity for Charity"".      Originally, James Franco was set to play the role of ""Arthur"" in Inception (2010); however, due to scheduling conflicts, James was forced to drop out of the film and the director of the film, Christopher Nolan, later gave the role to Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

I\'ve actually been painting longer than I\'ve been acting. A movie is a collaborative effort, and with painting you just have yourself.""      [About finding time to relax] ""Never. It\'s an impossibility. I don\'t even like to sleep. I feel as if there\'s too much to do.""      [About what he looks for in a girl] ""Just someone I can relate to artistically and who can also be understanding and supportive of the demands of my lifestyle.""      When I was a child, I wanted to be an actor, but I had really bad buck teeth. I didn\'t want to get braces, but my mom said I couldn\'t be an actor if I didn\'t get the braces. So, I got the braces.      I worked at a McDonald\'s drive-through. I could always tell when girls were interested: They\'d drive around again and say, ""I forgot something.""      Acting is an art form and you want to take roles that are challenged and it\'s more of a challenge I think to play dark characters. Not that I want to always play those, but it is a challenge and challenges are rewarding and fun.      You know, directors kind of want different things. Some of them think that if they just are always talking to you and keeping your spirits up and everything that it helps you, and then some leave you alone and give you your space.      [on playing gay characters] - It\'s funny because the way that kind of stuff is talked about on blogs is so black-and-white. It\'s all cut-and-dry identity politics. \'Is he straight or is he gay?\' Or, \'This is your third gay movie - come out already!\' And all based on, gay or straight, based on the idea that your object of affection decides your sexuality.There are lots of other reasons to be interested in gay characters than wanting myself to go out and have sex with guys. And there are also lots of other aspects about these characters that I\'m interested in, in addition to their sexuality. So, in some ways it\'s coincidental, in other ways it\'s not. I mean, I\'ve played a gay man who\'s living in the \'60s and \'70s, a gay man who we depicted in the \'50s, and one being in the \'20s. And those were all periods when to be gay, at least being gay in public, was much more difficult. Part of what I\'m interested in is how these people who were living anti-normative lifestyles contended with opposition. Or, you know what, maybe I\'m just gay.      [on using the videos trapped hiker Aron Ralston had made, in order to portray him in 127 Hours (2010)] He\'s not an actor giving a Shakespeare death soliloquy. He didn\'t want to lose himself because that would make it harder for his mother to watch. I knew that if I captured that, somehow, it would feel very authentic and powerful.      [on accepting a position as a dramatics teacher at New York University] I\'ve been very fortunate. I had to work hard but had opportunities to do everything that I wanted. That\'s one of the reasons I\'m teaching. I\'m trying to give back to other people. That\'s what I guess I want to do now - continue to be creative in a way that I can give back.      [Observation while making a documentary about the porn industry] When I was young, I got a video camera and my girlfriend and I decided to film ourselves and watched it back and said, \'Yeah, well, let\'s never watch that again\'. Those performers in pornos, they are great performers. They\'re not just doing it. They\'re selling it to an audience.      [2011, on being a troubled youth] I was arrested for a lot of petty crimes. It added up. I was a ward of the court and was put on probation. Finally, I\'d had enough chances, but they gave me one final chance, and, fortunately, I didn\'t get into any trouble after that. Otherwise, I guess it could have been like Lindsay Lohan, when she\'s on probation and then she\'s accused of stealing a necklace, and it\'s a kind of small thing that becomes a big thing. It\'s like probation doesn\'t end.      (2011, on his earliest jobs) When I was 13 or 14 my dad got me a job working the counter at a coffee shop. It sucked. I read books when the place was empty and got let go when the assistant manager told the boss he\'d found $2 in one of the aprons and said I was trying to steal. It turns out he had taken, like, $10,000. Later, when I wanted a car and my parents said they\'d match whatever I could pay, I got a job driving carts at the Palo Alto Golf Course. I would read stuff like Naked Lunch in the cart, and they let me go when they caught me reading the sequel to A Separate Peace. Another summer I got a job with a friend on his father\'s construction crew, but we just got high every day...I was (also) given an internship at Lockheed Martin. But that experience showed me I never wanted to work in that environment.      (2011, on the failure of Your Highness (2011)) I didn\'t write that movie. I was just doing my job. I think I\'m fine in it. They knew there were problems with that movie a year ago. Just because it comes out after the Oscars, it\'s like ""Oh, here\'s backlash"". Well, you have the year\'s best actress Oscar winner in it, so wouldn\'t that boost ticket sales? And people want to blame me for that? It\'s just ridiculous. There\'s this feeling about me like, ""He\'s doing too many things. Let\'s get him"".      [2011, on hosting the Oscars] It\'s hard to talk about because it\'s like assigning blame - not a fun thing to do. For three or four weeks, we shot the promos and the little film that played in the opening. In the last week, when we really started focusing on the script for the live show and did a run-through, I said to the producer, ""I don\'t know why you hired me, because you haven\'t given me anything. I just don\'t think this stuff\'s going to be good"". After the show, everybody was so happy, and Bruce Cohen, the show\'s producer, hugged me and said, ""Steven Spielberg just told me it was the best Oscars ever!"" As far as having low energy or seeming as though I wasn\'t into it or was too cool for it, I thought, Okay, Anne Hathaway is going the enthusiastic route. I\'ve been trained as an actor to respond to circumstances, to the people I\'m working with, and not to force anything. So I thought I would be the straight man and she could be the other, and that\'s how I was trying to do those lines. I felt kind of trapped in that material. I felt, \'This is not my boat. I\'m just a passenger, but I\'m going down and there\'s no way out\'.      (2011, on being a workaholic) I don\'t know, but the first short film I ever directed, years before I even went to film school at NYU, is about a boy who is introduced to the concept of his own mortality when his goldfish dies. He says to his parents, ""I don\'t want to die,"" and though they say he shouldn\'t worry because there\'s plenty of time, they don\'t really comfort him. So he thinks, I have to do everything now. He gets a neighbor girl to marry him, gets a job, starts a family. Although I\'ve changed and relaxed a bit, my behavior shows I\'ve thought along those lines for quite a while.      [on the show Girls (2012)] I am fine watching a show about women dealing with men. I watched Steel Magnolias (1989) when I was in junior high school and I can get off on female bonding. Done right. It\'s more interesting than male bonding. I\'m also aware that I may just be giving myself too much credit: for all I know, but for the grace of Judd Apatow, I could be just like those struggling male idiots I see on the show.      [on the moment that his successful film career failed to meet his artistic expectations] I remember getting ready to do the third \'Spiderman\', just thinking, I don\'t know if I can take it again. If I can take all the work that doesn\'t seem to have a payoff that is equal to the effort.As soon as I started branching out and pursuing my other interests I could say, \'OK... it\'s a place where more earnest kinds of exploration can happen.\'      There\'s this public persona that\'s \'James Franco\' that\'s half my creation but half of it isn\'t. Half of it\'s what other people write about me or how they perceive me. [His art is] a way of using... an image that other people have created and re-presenting it.      [on his comedic Bar Mitzvah, as he received the Hasty Pudding 2009 Man of the Year award] ...actually really touching. I\'m Jewish, my mother\'s Jewish, but I wasn\'t raised Jewish. I guess I wasn\'t a man until tonight.      [on directing himself as an actor] I\'ve done it many times before - it\'s something I\'ve grown used to. As a director you\'re viewing everything from above or the outside. You just want to make sure all the pieces are working well together. I\'ve acted in enough films that I can feel it from the inside, like okay, this is right... I actually don\'t like to do it. I enjoy directing other actors more. I enjoy the collaboration between directors and actors so much that - if I can get away with not being in a movie that I\'m directing - I will.      [on Marlon Brando] Brando\'s performances revolutionized American acting precisely because he didn\'t seem to be ""performing,"" in the sense that he wasn\'t putting something on as much as he was being. Off-screen he defied the studio system\'s control over his image, allowing his weight to fluctuate, choosing roles that were considered beneath him and turning down the Oscar for best actor in 1973. These were acts of rebellion against an industry that practically forces an actor to identify with his persona while at the same time repeatedly wresting it from him.      [on 4 luni, 3 saptamÃ¢ni si 2 zile (2007), one of his 5 favourite films] Again, a very simple approach, but there\'s so much power in that film. You\'re not quite sure what\'s happening from the beginning, but you\'re just kind of thrown into it. All you know is that these women have this mysterious meeting, and it takes you from there. The film gives you a great sense of what it was really like to live in Romania in the 1980s.[2009]Salary (3)The Company\xa0(2003)      $2,000,000       Oz the Great and Powerful\xa0(2013)      $7,000,000       The Interview\xa0(2014)      $6,500,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nEliza Dushku ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 92 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(2)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(72)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(13)  Overview (4)Date of Birth30\xa0December1980,\xa0Boston, Massachusetts, USA Birth NameElizabeth Patricia DushkuNicknameDuck Shoot    Height5\'\xa05""\xa0(1.65\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Eliza Dushku was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Judith (Rasmussen), a political science professor, and Philip R.

This is a very good movie. I do not understand why so many of the
comments here are negative. The plot is great with no holes. The
characters are well developed and the acting is top notch. Maybe the
lack of computer animation or computer generated special effects or car
chases or machine guns blazing away turned some of you off. If you like
dramas that are heavy on acting and character development, you will
like this movie. The filming locations are very fascinating too. I am
not sure where the boardwalk scenes are filmed (Asbury NJ or Yonkers
NY) but it looks just like a formerly popular beach front local, that
is now a ghost town. Very underrated by the IMDb voters.

This is a somewhat run-of-the-mill modern-day crime movie elevated by
the presence of actor Robert De Niro. He plays a policeman who is a
father to his druggie son, who is accused of murder. <br><br>""Vincent LaMarca"" (De Niro) is torn between the guilt of being an
absentee father to his kid (""Joey,"" played by James Franco) but still
loving him enough to help him and yet still be a good, honest cop.<br><br>This is a gritty film, a bid sordid in spots. The locale is a grimy
Atlantici City-type on-the- skids town by the ocean. It isn't pretty.
As tough as the story can be, it's still interesting and recommended as
a decent crime film. Actually, it's much more of a drama than an
action-crime film....but I liked it. It's an interesting character
study, as well.

""City by the Sea"" is all about De Niro as a New York homicide detective who
views the world as black and white and has trouble dealing with the grays of
interpersonal relationships. Adrift between a broken home history, an
ex-wife, a companion and bed mate (McDormand), and a adult son junkie
(Franco), the aging cop protag finds that forging needed reconciliations is
more difficult than busting the scumbags on his beat.  A solid three star
drama, ""City by the Sea"" is a must see for De Niro fans and a good watch for
anyone into gritty dramas. (B+)

City By the Sea is definately the most depressing movie I have ever seen.
It's amazing to see how much troubles one man has to endure all at once. I
wasn't expecting much from this film but I was surprised at the strength
that this movie has. It takes your emotions on a roller-coaster ride. Robert
DeNiro has an amazing screen presence and his performance is very well done
and is very convincing. It was great to see DeNiro in a role like this after
seeing him in somewhat demeaning roles like that in 'Analyze This'. DeNiro
is truly a powerful actor and this movie reassures that. James Franco is
equally convincing as Robert DeNiro's junkie son. Some parts of the movie
are so morbid that it is discouraging, but the overall excellence of City By
the Sea is well worth it. At first the characters seem a little
one-dimensional, but as the plot progresses all that changes. This is a very
well done movie with great acting, directing and cinematography. Powerful
and moving.<br><br>****

2002's 'City By the Sea' was a film that slipped by me when it first
came out. I was living overseas and missed it completely. Having
finally had a chance to watch it, I think it is the best film that
Robert DeNiro has been in since 'Ronin' and up to 2006, his last great
dramatic performance. He stars in 'City By the Sea' as the absentee
father of James Franco. DeNiro is a decorated homicide cop who, while
investigating a murder, finds uncomfortable evidence that concretely
links his son to the murder. The film becomes a redemptive tale as
DeNiro's character tries to make up for the damage of the lost years
and save his son from a series of rapidly expanding catastrophes.<br><br>'City By the Sea' borrows from the noir tradition with a gritty locale,
seedy characters and two male leads who have unlocked a series of
events that are bigger than they are. DeNiro and Franco are both
excellent here. Franco is tremendous for the entire film as a junkie
who is trying (perhaps not very hard) to escape from his current life
for one mixed of fantasy and memory. His final scenes with De Niro are
powerful.<br><br>The DeNiro performance? I think that he played it perfectly. His
character in the film tends to be very restrained and controlled. He
analyzes and then makes his move. Part of this has to do with the
background of the character. He hides his past because he's trying to
protect his own vulnerabilities. By the time we reach the climactic
scene towards the end of the film with his son, the restraint and
control are gone. He is trying to save his son and the impassioned
speech he gives is some of the best work I've seen him do. 'City By the
Sea' is more of a redemptive drama than a crime drama and I think that
the way the film was packaged and marketed may have confused that. In
the climactic scene with Franco, you see the culmination of a great
performance by a great actor. I was more impressed by the emotion and
power of that scene than I was by anything else I've watched in quite a
while.<br><br>'City By the Sea' is slow, but worth the journey. Very good acting all
around and you might very well be a James Franco fan after seeing this
if you weren't before.

I'm really not a fan of cop/crime dramas.<br><br>I watched this on a recommendation without any clue about its content, and I
have to say I quite enjoyed it.<br><br>De Niro is Vincent laMarca, a detective of many years on the force. His wife
is estranged and he hasn't seen his son Joey in 15 years but finds himself
pursuing the boy when Joey is wanted in connection with the murder of a drug
dealer. Joey is in a bad way, being a drug addict himself and father of a
son he can't support, so perenially finds himself in conflict with his
mother who reluctantly tolerates his junkie nature and internally with
himself.<br><br>Frances McDormand plays Michelle, Vincent's current relationship, though the
depth of the relationship seems rather superficial given the 2 live in the
same apartment block but seperate appartments.
She wants to know more about Vincent when she decides she doesn't know him
at all, but his past is murky with a complex and dark family
history.<br><br>Add to this, his son, Joey's own son with Gina who essentially loses faith
in both Joey and her own ability to be a mother, and you have a rather
subtle and dark drama with a lot of complexities.<br><br>It is worth noting that all the performances are as excellent as you would
expect, particularly the breath-taking de Niro, in one of his best roles for
years. This is the type of character he was born to play and he's so
convincing as Vincent.<br><br>As a crime story and cop drama it's one for fans especially, but if you know
good cinema you will appreciate it too.<br><br>

The problem with this movie is that it has real substance, real integrity.
Men won't like it because it's much too serious, and the bodycount is
relatively low.  Women won't like it because the message is for men.<br><br>But let there be no mistake about this picture.  It is first class
storytelling with a first rate group of actors.  And the result is a
terrific picture that is hardly predictable (no matter what other reviewers
might opine).<br><br>City By The Sea is a dark, unrelenting look into a dysfunctional family.  It

""City by the Sea"" starring Robert DeNiro and Frances McDormand (Fargo &amp;
Almost Famous) is an exciting and heartfelt melodrama.  Director Michael
Caton-Jones proves himself with one of his greatest efforts to date,
bouncing back from his previous disappointing and misdirected film ""The
Jackal.""  Caton-Jones displays a style all his own with stunning atmospheric
poignancy.  The city by the sea, to which the film refers to is Long Island,
N.Y., a wonderfully lonely and dilapidated city to where junkie Jimmy Nova,
(DeNiro's son) calls home.<br><br>DeNiro plays a well-respected cop with a terribly troubled past that seems
to constantly haunt him.  His ex-wife, played by Patti Lupone, struggles to
get over the violence of their past relationship while his son, played by
James Franco, is headed down the same path as DeNiro's father once was, that
of an (alleged?) murderer.  Jimmy Nova, as he's known around town mixes with
the wrong crowd, as do most junkies, and one night finds himself struggling
for his life, and before he knows it, stabbing and killing a high profile
drug dealer.  This relatively small act of self-defense cascades a sequence
of irreversible events, which never seem to let up until the end.  DeNiro,
of course, is assigned to the case and unknowingly hunts down his own son
who he hasn't seen or heard from in several years.  Both father and son have
moved on with their lives since their seperation, but still harbor intense
emotional feelings for each other that seem to slowly emerge further and
further into the film.  To top it all off the two men are involved in
complex relationships of their own which naturally complicates things
further.<br><br> DeNiro's relationship with Frances McDormand seems quite convenient at
times, but nonetheless shows the tenderness and compassion of both
characters, while Franco's relationship feels more like a fling with

tracks. Fourteen years later, De Niro's handsome son James Franco (as
Joey LaMarca) has become a gaunt Long Beach junkie, with a neglected

(without giving anything away) note that Franco's opening ""killing"" is
hardly a crime. Wouldn't the film's theme have worked better if this

This is a very good movie. I do not understand why so many of the
comments here are negative. The plot is great with no holes. The
characters are well developed and the acting is top notch. Maybe the
lack of computer animation or computer generated special effects or car
chases or machine guns blazing away turned some of you off. If you like
dramas that are heavy on acting and character development, you will
like this movie. The filming locations are very fascinating too. I am
not sure where the boardwalk scenes are filmed (Asbury NJ or Yonkers
NY) but it looks just like a formerly popular beach front local, that
is now a ghost town. Very underrated by the IMDb voters.

This is a somewhat run-of-the-mill modern-day crime movie elevated by
the presence of actor Robert De Niro. He plays a policeman who is a
father to his druggie son, who is accused of murder. <br><br>""Vincent LaMarca"" (De Niro) is torn between the guilt of being an
absentee father to his kid (""Joey,"" played by James Franco) but still
loving him enough to help him and yet still be a good, honest cop.<br><br>This is a gritty film, a bid sordid in spots. The locale is a grimy
Atlantici City-type on-the- skids town by the ocean. It isn't pretty.
As tough as the story can be, it's still interesting and recommended as
a decent crime film. Actually, it's much more of a drama than an
action-crime film....but I liked it. It's an interesting character
study, as well.

""City by the Sea"" is all about De Niro as a New York homicide detective who
views the world as black and white and has trouble dealing with the grays of
interpersonal relationships. Adrift between a broken home history, an
ex-wife, a companion and bed mate (McDormand), and a adult son junkie
(Franco), the aging cop protag finds that forging needed reconciliations is
more difficult than busting the scumbags on his beat.  A solid three star
drama, ""City by the Sea"" is a must see for De Niro fans and a good watch for
anyone into gritty dramas. (B+)

City By the Sea is definately the most depressing movie I have ever seen.
It's amazing to see how much troubles one man has to endure all at once. I
wasn't expecting much from this film but I was surprised at the strength
that this movie has. It takes your emotions on a roller-coaster ride. Robert
DeNiro has an amazing screen presence and his performance is very well done
and is very convincing. It was great to see DeNiro in a role like this after
seeing him in somewhat demeaning roles like that in 'Analyze This'. DeNiro
is truly a powerful actor and this movie reassures that. James Franco is
equally convincing as Robert DeNiro's junkie son. Some parts of the movie
are so morbid that it is discouraging, but the overall excellence of City By
the Sea is well worth it. At first the characters seem a little
one-dimensional, but as the plot progresses all that changes. This is a very
well done movie with great acting, directing and cinematography. Powerful
and moving.<br><br>****

2002's 'City By the Sea' was a film that slipped by me when it first
came out. I was living overseas and missed it completely. Having
finally had a chance to watch it, I think it is the best film that
Robert DeNiro has been in since 'Ronin' and up to 2006, his last great
dramatic performance. He stars in 'City By the Sea' as the absentee
father of James Franco. DeNiro is a decorated homicide cop who, while
investigating a murder, finds uncomfortable evidence that concretely
links his son to the murder. The film becomes a redemptive tale as
DeNiro's character tries to make up for the damage of the lost years
and save his son from a series of rapidly expanding catastrophes.<br><br>'City By the Sea' borrows from the noir tradition with a gritty locale,
seedy characters and two male leads who have unlocked a series of
events that are bigger than they are. DeNiro and Franco are both
excellent here. Franco is tremendous for the entire film as a junkie
who is trying (perhaps not very hard) to escape from his current life
for one mixed of fantasy and memory. His final scenes with De Niro are
powerful.<br><br>The DeNiro performance? I think that he played it perfectly. His
character in the film tends to be very restrained and controlled. He
analyzes and then makes his move. Part of this has to do with the
background of the character. He hides his past because he's trying to
protect his own vulnerabilities. By the time we reach the climactic
scene towards the end of the film with his son, the restraint and
control are gone. He is trying to save his son and the impassioned
speech he gives is some of the best work I've seen him do. 'City By the
Sea' is more of a redemptive drama than a crime drama and I think that
the way the film was packaged and marketed may have confused that. In
the climactic scene with Franco, you see the culmination of a great
performance by a great actor. I was more impressed by the emotion and
power of that scene than I was by anything else I've watched in quite a
while.<br><br>'City By the Sea' is slow, but worth the journey. Very good acting all
around and you might very well be a James Franco fan after seeing this
if you weren't before.

I'm really not a fan of cop/crime dramas.<br><br>I watched this on a recommendation without any clue about its content, and I
have to say I quite enjoyed it.<br><br>De Niro is Vincent laMarca, a detective of many years on the force. His wife
is estranged and he hasn't seen his son Joey in 15 years but finds himself
pursuing the boy when Joey is wanted in connection with the murder of a drug
dealer. Joey is in a bad way, being a drug addict himself and father of a
son he can't support, so perenially finds himself in conflict with his
mother who reluctantly tolerates his junkie nature and internally with
himself.<br><br>Frances McDormand plays Michelle, Vincent's current relationship, though the
depth of the relationship seems rather superficial given the 2 live in the
same apartment block but seperate appartments.
She wants to know more about Vincent when she decides she doesn't know him
at all, but his past is murky with a complex and dark family
history.<br><br>Add to this, his son, Joey's own son with Gina who essentially loses faith
in both Joey and her own ability to be a mother, and you have a rather
subtle and dark drama with a lot of complexities.<br><br>It is worth noting that all the performances are as excellent as you would
expect, particularly the breath-taking de Niro, in one of his best roles for
years. This is the type of character he was born to play and he's so
convincing as Vincent.<br><br>As a crime story and cop drama it's one for fans especially, but if you know
good cinema you will appreciate it too.<br><br>

The problem with this movie is that it has real substance, real integrity.
Men won't like it because it's much too serious, and the bodycount is
relatively low.  Women won't like it because the message is for men.<br><br>But let there be no mistake about this picture.  It is first class
storytelling with a first rate group of actors.  And the result is a
terrific picture that is hardly predictable (no matter what other reviewers
might opine).<br><br>City By The Sea is a dark, unrelenting look into a dysfunctional family.  It
addresses the frailty and imperfection of a father who chose to retreat

Jesse has been acting almost constantly since his big debut in a Q-Tip commercial when he was an 8-month-old baby. He started acting and modeling as a child and has had steady work since the age of 4. He graduated from Brien MacMahon High School in his home town of Norwalk, and went on to study film at Columbia University.Jesse\'s film-acting debut was in Falling in Love (1984), but he first came to the attention of the movie-going public when he starred in Steven Soderbergh\'s cult classic King of the Hill (1993), with Spalding Gray and Elizabeth McGovern. After receiving rave reviews for that performance, he followed up with roles in Romeo + Juliet (1996) with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, Hackers (1995) opposite Jonny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie, and Far from Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog (1995). For King of the Hill (1993), he was nominated for the CFCA\'s Most promising actor award and the Young Artist Award for Best Youth Actor Leading Role in a Motion Picture Drama. For his work in Far from Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog (1995), he was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Young Leading Actor in a Feature Film.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Keith Rogers          Trivia (11)      Made his first television appearance as an infant in a Q-tip commercial.      He took French in high school but Spanish in college.      Homecoming king at his high school.      Jesse is ambidextrous. His right hand is dominant, but he can use either.      He is an accomplished guitarist.      Is an only child.      Shares his name with two fictional female characters. One played by Lara Flynn Boyle in the 1987 mini-series Amerika (1987), and the other one played by Olivia Hussey in the horror film Black Christmas (1974).

Jesse\'s paternal grandmother, Florence Louise Bradford, was from Hackney, London, England.Personal Quotes (3)      Everyone always told me I was fated to be in front of the camera.      I love being around kids; they\'re honest and refreshing, and I love teaching them new things.      [on Clint Eastwood\'s directorial efficiency] I heard rumors that he really does two takes, but I had a friend who was going into a Clint Eastwood movie, I wouldn\'t say he does two takes - I would say he does one. The average is probably two, but the number of times we only did one was overwhelming. It\'s kind of cool because, as an actor, it forces you to be on your game. With this movie, I learned really quickly to be very clear on what I thought were the most important aspects of the scene and how I wanted those aspects to come off, and then practice how I was going to make sure they did, because if I only got one shot, I didn\'t want to be the guy who was always asking for another take.

I think from here on it\'s up to me to prove that I\'m growing up and that I have other things to say, but in terms of the show it definitely gave me all of the opportunities I\'ve had so far.      I find that people are constantly coming up to me now. There\'s been a definite surge of people recognizing me and I\'m not sure if it has to do with the DVDs or not, but I\'ve sort of assumed that it does because the show has been off the air for three years now.      There was a scene early on during the first season of Roswell and I broke down crying. Since then, I\'ve always just been able to do it.      There are a lot of different sides to me.

If you've seen `Fatal Attraction,' then there really isn't much reason for
you to check out `Swimfan,' which carries the psycho stalker scenario to
absurd heights.  But since the target audience for this film is today's
teens, chances are many of its viewers will never even have heard of `Fatal
Attraction,' let alone seen it.<br><br>`Swimfan' is set in one of those high schools that exist only in the movies
Â you know, the ones that seem to be populated almost entirely by
twenty-something hunks and babes (with the occasional nerd thrown in) and
which appear to be utterly devoid of teachers, principals, counselors or any
other adult supervisory staff to run the place (in all fairness, we DO get
to see one swim coach).   None of these students are ever seen attending a
class, cracking open a book or doing any homework, but then that would sort
of spoil the fun of the high school experience now, wouldn't
it?<br><br>Ben Cronin (Jesse Bradford) doesn't ask much out of life.  All he wants is
to be left alone to concentrate on his swimming so that he'll be in tiptop
shape to impress the scouts who are coming out from Stanford to have a look
at him.  That's his plan anyway, until one day, into his life, strolls
Madison Belle (Erika Christensen), a pretty young seductress, who, upon her
arrival at the school, makes an immediate beeline for Ben, seducing him in
the school's swimming pool and making his life thoroughly miserable
thereafter.  Soon Madison is stalking our hero in true Glenn Close fashion,
finding ways to insinuate herself into every aspect of Ben's once seemingly
ideal life.  Indeed, Ben has every thing going for him: popularity, good
looks, athletic prowess, a devoted mother, a girlfriend who loves him Â and
it all threatens to come crashing down around him after just one night of
unbridled passion with this fresh-from-out-of-town psychotic nut case. <br><br>About the only interesting aspect of `Swimfan' is how it shows that, in this
technologically advanced age, a genuine stalker now has so many more options
at his or her disposal Â answering machines, cell phones, pagers, voice
mail, email, instant messages.  The possibilities are endless.  It's enough
to make one long for the good old days when an obsessed paramour had to at
least foot the bill for a phone call or buy a stamp to send a deranged
letter, or at least find ever more clever ways of skulking around.  Stalking
just seems way too easy these days.  Technology appears to have taken all
the challenge out of it.<br><br>Unlike `Fatal Attraction,' which at least managed to achieve a level of
credibility before it went off the deep end in the final act, `Swimfan'
never establishes a believable tone.   Madison's actions always just feel
like melodramatic plot points, and Ben's retaliatory measures aren't much
better.  And the law enforcement in the town Â well, the less said about
THEM the better!  Ultimately, the story becomes more and more preposterous
as it churns along, so much so that the film actually ends up generating
more laughs than gasps by the time it is over.  Jesse Bradford and Erika
Christensen may still have solid acting careers ahead of them, but my
suspicion is that `Swimfan' will not rank very high on either of their
resumes.

Ben Cronin (Jesse Bradford) is an ex-addicted in drugs athlete. He is
disputing a participation in the Olympic games and joining Stanford
University through swimming. He is in love with his girlfriend Amy Miller
(Shiri Appleby) and is a good son, working with his mother in a hospital.
When the young woman Madison Bell (Erika Christensen) joins his high-school,
he is seduced by her and has an intercourse with her in the swimming pool.
Madison chases him, but he turns her down. She becomes obsessed by him and
turns his life in hell. This teen version of `Fatal Attraction' is very
predicable, but is not a bad movie. The young cast has a good performance
and this film is a good entertainment. My vote is six.<br><br>Title (Brazil): `FixaÃ§Ã£o' (`Fixation')

I would like to say that this movie hasn't got many reasons to be as good as
it is, because it is a teen/twentysomething play on a formula that's kind
of, or for lack of a better phrase truly, been done to death. Fatal
Attraction movies, while occasionally pulling at least one different trick
out of their hat, are always the same, that's why Michael Douglas is in 95%
of them. However, it's extremely well made by director John Polson and
well-acted by the young cast, particularly Traffic's Erika Christensen, who
shines as Madison Bell, the obsessive swim fan of the title.<br><br>The story deals with Ben Cronin, a high school senior who's life is going
pretty well, as the hero's usually is at the start of these pictures, he has
a lot of good friends, he has a girlfriend Amy (Shiri Appleby) who is as
sweet as apple pie, and he's on the way to a swimming scholarship to
Stanford. However, all of that changes once he encounters Madison Bell, the
seductive new girl in town. He only wants to be friends with her, but after
they have a one night stand, she becomes more obsessive, stalking him,
ruining every aspect of his life, and generally acting like a nuisance. I
suppose I don't have to say that because that is pretty much how a Fatal
Attraction picture works.<br><br>What makes this movie work is that it is well done, and it is as creepy as
most FA clones need to be if they expect to work. Plus, the three leads are
all very good, albeit this film belongs to Erika Christensen, who does a
pretty good job of stealing the movie.
</br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>
The character Madison is interesting but when the story comes to the
end, everything turned so quick and seems to get more and more
nonsense. The power of Madison is overwhelming. She knows everything,
she can go anywhere. At last, she, a young girl, killed 2 police
officers! Going back to the swimming pool with Amy seems to be too
dramatic and comedic. The acting skills of Erika Christensen is
impressive. She shows inner anger but lack of psychic complications.
When facing the ""truth"" that she was not loved by Ben, she did not show
much ""lost"" by her eyes contacts and facial expression, instead, the
editing did. And this is what the mood is built up by editing
throughout the film.

Have to admit that I enjoy watching the infamous teen horror films.  Don't
get me wrong, they probably won't be nominated for any Academy Awards, but
they're not a waste of a movie ticket either.<br><br>Both Jesse Bradford and Erika Christensen carry the film well.  Although
much of the plot remains predictable, with a lot of help from the
trailers,
there are still a few plot twists that will keep viewers interested.
Madison Bell (Christensen) is the new student who gets what she wants, at
any cost.  Obession can be a very interesting and intriguing game as she
sets her sights on Ben Cronin (Bradford).  However, Ben already has the
perfect life as a high school student (a chance at Stanford, the perfect
girl and a solid swimming career.  Throw a monkey wrench into the
equation,
and Ben's world spins out of control.<br><br>A good movie to see on a date, or if City by the Sea isn't appealing.

This is one of those films that proves once again that there are limits
to how much decent production values can redeem a bad script. Lenny
Bruce had a great line that covers the situation: ""You can't get snot
off a suede jacket."" Directed by the guy who helmed ""Hide and Seek,""
which I haven't seen yet, but eventually will once I find it for free
at the library like I did this one (thank goodness!), ""Swimfan"" (an
inept title if ever I've seen one) has some nice camera-work and decent
acting going for it, but not much else. It's one of those films that
has you progressing from ""Huh?"" to ""What the...?"" to ""Now hold on a
second!"" to ""Oh, for God's sake!"" to ""Alright, now that's just
ridiculous!"" over the course of its beguiling but vacuous running time.
The leads are attractive enough and do their best with the slim
material, but simply cannot overcome the forced storyline. I know I
finally gave up on it completely when bad girl Madison shot her way out
of the back seat of a police cruiser. Handcuffs in front? A
conveniently left-handed cop in the back seat who leaves his weapon
conveniently unsecured? Please. Dan Hedaya has an uncharacteristic turn
as a relatively sane swimming coach, but was obviously just taking a
paycheck. Eminently skippable unless you're an Erica Christensen
groupie (I found Shiri Appleby much more attractive), ""Swimfan"" sinks
rapidly in the deep waters of its own stupidity and lack of
believability.
</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>
We've seen this idea before, in other films like ""Fatal Attraction""
(1987) and ""The Crush"" (1993). A woman obsesses about a man, and won't
let go. Given the high school age of the main characters in ""Swimfan"",
and given background music that is mostly sophomoric, the film is
clearly targeted at people under the age of twenty-five.<br><br>Ben Cronin (Jesse Bradford) is annoyingly smug. He's your prototype
high school pop jock. He drives around in a macho-looking pickup truck.
Madison Bell (lovely Erika Christensen) gets a crush on Ben and, even
knowing he already has a girlfriend, stalks him relentlessly; she's his
femme fatale. Conveniently unstable and manipulative, Madison makes
trouble for Ben with one plot contrivance after another.<br><br>The script has a setup that is too long. And the second half of the
script has action that is wildly improbable. Madison just seems to
appear from out of nowhere in the most unlikely places, and at just the
right time. Her efforts are too easy, especially as they relate to
hospital security and police procedures. It's as if she has superhuman
powers, not an effect you want to impart as a storyteller, unless your
story fits in the sci-fi or fantasy genre, which this film does not.<br><br>If the script is weak, the acting is generally pretty good, with
reasonably effective performances from Jesse Bradford, Erika
Christensen, and James DeBello as Dante. The film's color
cinematography is fine. And I also liked the editing, with jump cuts
that neatly corresponded with Madison's state of mind.<br><br>""Swimfan"" is not a bad movie. But its premise is unoriginal, and the
plot structure is faulty. A script rewrite or two might have rendered a
better cinematic outcome. However, other elements of the film are fine.
And for the right audience, this film does have some entertainment
value, at least for a one-time viewing.

If you've seen `Fatal Attraction,' then there really isn't much reason for
you to check out `Swimfan,' which carries the psycho stalker scenario to
absurd heights.  But since the target audience for this film is today's
teens, chances are many of its viewers will never even have heard of `Fatal
Attraction,' let alone seen it.<br><br>`Swimfan' is set in one of those high schools that exist only in the movies
Â you know, the ones that seem to be populated almost entirely by
twenty-something hunks and babes (with the occasional nerd thrown in) and
which appear to be utterly devoid of teachers, principals, counselors or any
other adult supervisory staff to run the place (in all fairness, we DO get
to see one swim coach).   None of these students are ever seen attending a
class, cracking open a book or doing any homework, but then that would sort
of spoil the fun of the high school experience now, wouldn't
it?<br><br>Ben Cronin (Jesse Bradford) doesn't ask much out of life.  All he wants is
to be left alone to concentrate on his swimming so that he'll be in tiptop
shape to impress the scouts who are coming out from Stanford to have a look
at him.  That's his plan anyway, until one day, into his life, strolls
Madison Belle (Erika Christensen), a pretty young seductress, who, upon her
arrival at the school, makes an immediate beeline for Ben, seducing him in
the school's swimming pool and making his life thoroughly miserable
thereafter.  Soon Madison is stalking our hero in true Glenn Close fashion,
finding ways to insinuate herself into every aspect of Ben's once seemingly
ideal life.  Indeed, Ben has every thing going for him: popularity, good
looks, athletic prowess, a devoted mother, a girlfriend who loves him Â and
it all threatens to come crashing down around him after just one night of
unbridled passion with this fresh-from-out-of-town psychotic nut case. <br><br>About the only interesting aspect of `Swimfan' is how it shows that, in this
technologically advanced age, a genuine stalker now has so many more options
at his or her disposal Â answering machines, cell phones, pagers, voice
mail, email, instant messages.  The possibilities are endless.  It's enough
to make one long for the good old days when an obsessed paramour had to at
least foot the bill for a phone call or buy a stamp to send a deranged
letter, or at least find ever more clever ways of skulking around.  Stalking
just seems way too easy these days.  Technology appears to have taken all
the challenge out of it.<br><br>Unlike `Fatal Attraction,' which at least managed to achieve a level of
credibility before it went off the deep end in the final act, `Swimfan'
never establishes a believable tone.   Madison's actions always just feel
like melodramatic plot points, and Ben's retaliatory measures aren't much
better.  And the law enforcement in the town Â well, the less said about
THEM the better!  Ultimately, the story becomes more and more preposterous
as it churns along, so much so that the film actually ends up generating
more laughs than gasps by the time it is over.  Jesse Bradford and Erika
Christensen may still have solid acting careers ahead of them, but my
suspicion is that `Swimfan' will not rank very high on either of their
resumes.

Ben Cronin (Jesse Bradford) is an ex-addicted in drugs athlete. He is
disputing a participation in the Olympic games and joining Stanford
University through swimming. He is in love with his girlfriend Amy Miller
(Shiri Appleby) and is a good son, working with his mother in a hospital.
When the young woman Madison Bell (Erika Christensen) joins his high-school,
he is seduced by her and has an intercourse with her in the swimming pool.
Madison chases him, but he turns her down. She becomes obsessed by him and
turns his life in hell. This teen version of `Fatal Attraction' is very
predicable, but is not a bad movie. The young cast has a good performance
and this film is a good entertainment. My vote is six.<br><br>Title (Brazil): `FixaÃ§Ã£o' (`Fixation')

I would like to say that this movie hasn't got many reasons to be as good as
it is, because it is a teen/twentysomething play on a formula that's kind
of, or for lack of a better phrase truly, been done to death. Fatal
Attraction movies, while occasionally pulling at least one different trick
out of their hat, are always the same, that's why Michael Douglas is in 95%
of them. However, it's extremely well made by director John Polson and
well-acted by the young cast, particularly Traffic's Erika Christensen, who
shines as Madison Bell, the obsessive swim fan of the title.<br><br>The story deals with Ben Cronin, a high school senior who's life is going
pretty well, as the hero's usually is at the start of these pictures, he has
a lot of good friends, he has a girlfriend Amy (Shiri Appleby) who is as
sweet as apple pie, and he's on the way to a swimming scholarship to
Stanford. However, all of that changes once he encounters Madison Bell, the
seductive new girl in town. He only wants to be friends with her, but after
they have a one night stand, she becomes more obsessive, stalking him,
ruining every aspect of his life, and generally acting like a nuisance. I
suppose I don't have to say that because that is pretty much how a Fatal
Attraction picture works.<br><br>What makes this movie work is that it is well done, and it is as creepy as
most FA clones need to be if they expect to work. Plus, the three leads are
all very good, albeit this film belongs to Erika Christensen, who does a
pretty good job of stealing the movie.
</br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>
The character Madison is interesting but when the story comes to the
end, everything turned so quick and seems to get more and more
nonsense. The power of Madison is overwhelming. She knows everything,
she can go anywhere. At last, she, a young girl, killed 2 police
officers! Going back to the swimming pool with Amy seems to be too
dramatic and comedic. The acting skills of Erika Christensen is
impressive. She shows inner anger but lack of psychic complications.
When facing the ""truth"" that she was not loved by Ben, she did not show
much ""lost"" by her eyes contacts and facial expression, instead, the
editing did. And this is what the mood is built up by editing
throughout the film.

Have to admit that I enjoy watching the infamous teen horror films.  Don't
get me wrong, they probably won't be nominated for any Academy Awards, but
they're not a waste of a movie ticket either.<br><br>Both Jesse Bradford and Erika Christensen carry the film well.  Although
much of the plot remains predictable, with a lot of help from the
trailers,
there are still a few plot twists that will keep viewers interested.
Madison Bell (Christensen) is the new student who gets what she wants, at
any cost.  Obession can be a very interesting and intriguing game as she
sets her sights on Ben Cronin (Bradford).  However, Ben already has the
perfect life as a high school student (a chance at Stanford, the perfect
girl and a solid swimming career.  Throw a monkey wrench into the
equation,
and Ben's world spins out of control.<br><br>A good movie to see on a date, or if City by the Sea isn't appealing.
Leave
the youngsters at home on this one.

This is one of those films that proves once again that there are limits
to how much decent production values can redeem a bad script. Lenny
Bruce had a great line that covers the situation: ""You can't get snot
off a suede jacket."" Directed by the guy who helmed ""Hide and Seek,""
which I haven't seen yet, but eventually will once I find it for free
at the library like I did this one (thank goodness!), ""Swimfan"" (an
inept title if ever I've seen one) has some nice camera-work and decent
acting going for it, but not much else. It's one of those films that
has you progressing from ""Huh?"" to ""What the...?"" to ""Now hold on a
second!"" to ""Oh, for God's sake!"" to ""Alright, now that's just
ridiculous!"" over the course of its beguiling but vacuous running time.
The leads are attractive enough and do their best with the slim
material, but simply cannot overcome the forced storyline. I know I
finally gave up on it completely when bad girl Madison shot her way out
of the back seat of a police cruiser. Handcuffs in front? A
conveniently left-handed cop in the back seat who leaves his weapon
conveniently unsecured? Please. Dan Hedaya has an uncharacteristic turn
as a relatively sane swimming coach, but was obviously just taking a
paycheck. Eminently skippable unless you're an Erica Christensen
groupie (I found Shiri Appleby much more attractive), ""Swimfan"" sinks
rapidly in the deep waters of its own stupidity and lack of
believability.
</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>
We've seen this idea before, in other films like ""Fatal Attraction""
(1987) and ""The Crush"" (1993). A woman obsesses about a man, and won't
let go. Given the high school age of the main characters in ""Swimfan"",
and given background music that is mostly sophomoric, the film is
clearly targeted at people under the age of twenty-five.<br><br>Ben Cronin (Jesse Bradford) is annoyingly smug. He's your prototype
high school pop jock. He drives around in a macho-looking pickup truck.
Madison Bell (lovely Erika Christensen) gets a crush on Ben and, even
knowing he already has a girlfriend, stalks him relentlessly; she's his
femme fatale. Conveniently unstable and manipulative, Madison makes
trouble for Ben with one plot contrivance after another.<br><br>The script has a setup that is too long. And the second half of the
script has action that is wildly improbable. Madison just seems to
appear from out of nowhere in the most unlikely places, and at just the
right time. Her efforts are too easy, especially as they relate to
hospital security and police procedures. It's as if she has superhuman
powers, not an effect you want to impart as a storyteller, unless your
story fits in the sci-fi or fantasy genre, which this film does not.<br><br>If the script is weak, the acting is generally pretty good, with
reasonably effective performances from Jesse Bradford, Erika
Christensen, and James DeBello as Dante. The film's color
cinematography is fine. And I also liked the editing, with jump cuts
that neatly corresponded with Madison's state of mind.<br><br>""Swimfan"" is not a bad movie. But its premise is unoriginal, and the
plot structure is faulty. A script rewrite or two might have rendered a
better cinematic outcome. However, other elements of the film are fine.
And for the right audience, this film does have some entertainment
value, at least for a one-time viewing.

The L.A. dog walking scene provides a colorful backdrop for the story of Ellie Moore, damaged goods on the run from her latest abusive boyfriend and on the verge of transformation. She's helped along in that process by Betsy Wright, a misanthropic dog-walker in need of help with her business and struggling with her own dark past. The odd relationship between the cranky dog-walker and her unstable new apprentice proves the catalyst for the emotional journey Ellie must undertake. In Betsy, she finds a dark mirror of herself - a lonely, angry, complex woman whose own troubled past proves disturbingly close to her own. And in the dogs, she finds lost pieces of herself as she fumbles with the leash to her own life - struggling to hold on as it pulls her toward a brighter future before her past catches up with her.

Jaques Thelemaque and Diane Gaidry are a husband and wife team that are
finding their voice as filmmakers through this story of Ellie, a quiet,
lost woman who is searching for her path in life. In this, their first
feature, they achieve storytelling of a much more mature level than
most first features. How wonderful to explore the hope that animals
provide us; we so often take that for granted. Pamela Gordon gives a
wonderful, gritty performance. No nonsense with her. Such a loss when
she passed away in real life. Go see this film, and watch for future
films by Jacques Thelemaque. Look up Diane Gaidry. She's been in
countless films recently as an actress, and recently won an award!

In the true spirit of independent film-making, writer/director Jacques
Thelemaque and his wife/ partner, gifted actress Diane Gaidry, create a
sensitive yet powerful film that is reminiscent of Cassavetes and
Rowland collaborations in the past. The late Pamela Gordon also gives a
stellar performance, as together this team puts a very truthful
portrayal, a slice of real life up on the screen. Dogwalker is a
touching story about healing old wounds and finding new friendship,
love and hope in rebuilding one's life. Thelemaque directs with a
master's touch, and his style reminds me of the best offerings from
John Sayles. The fact that both Thelemaque &amp; Gaidry are co-founders of
Filmmakers Alliance in Los Angeles, and that that very community
contributed immensely to making the film, sets them apart in the
independent world as leaders who put their money where their heart is,
and deliver the goods when they themselves are out in the field. To not
see this accomplishment of theirs is to doubt the very foundation of
independent film-making. And if you're a filmmaker, see this film and
celebrate in their triumph, so you can be inspired by what's possible
and aim high in your own aspirations.

The DOG WALKER is and extremely powerful film. If you are looking for a
""Hollywood"" film with a big named cast and heavy budget then this film
is not for you. I would encourage you not to watch it. Please don't
waste your time; this film doesn't have either aspect to it. It's
obvious when you go to sit down and watch the film that this is a
character driven independent film. If you can let go to the fact that
Julia Roberts isn't acting in this or Spielberg isn't directing this
with a thirty million dollar budget, then this film is for you. First
of all, the performance by Diane Gaidry, Pamela Godon and the rest of
the cast were real, which makes the story that much stronger. You have
to give credit to their strong screen presence do to the directing and
writing of Jacques Thelemaque. Not a dog fan? So what! The film is not
about ""dogs,"" it's about people and relationships. If you are a dog
fan, that's the perks for watching it. I'm not going to tell you to
watch this because you should support independent films. I am going to

I saw this at the Santa Fe Film Festival while volunteering, and I'm
really
glad I stayed
and watched it! I really like the idea of dark, tarnished characters and
Diane Gaidry's
portrayal of a women trying to leave her past behind and start fresh was
very
compelling. She does find redemption in a very non-trivial
way

This is an amazing and touching film. You don't even have to be a dog
lover to enjoy it! Although the title may lead you to think that it's
merely a film about dogs, it's about so much more. This film explores
an array of important issues such as cancer and domestic abuse
powerfully, but without being preachy or heavy handed.<br><br>Jacques Thelemaque writes and directs with honesty and grace, and the
performances by Diane Gaidry and Pamela Gordon are authentic and full
of real human emotion, which seems to be missing from most independent
films these days. This is the kind of independent film that deserves
your support, go see it and I guarantee you will not be disappointed!

Loved it.  And I'm a lawyer who generally can find an argument
against almost any movie.  Simple, authentic, smart and very
touching.  Can't ask for more.  Nonetheless, I just submitted this
and they said I needed a minimum of ten lines.  So, I'll say that the
acting is marvelous.  Saw here on IMDB that the older actress,
Pamela Gordon, died recently.  That's sad.  She was great.  The
younger one, Diane Gaidry, was great, too.  Sorta has a young
Melanie Griffith quality. Would love to see more stuff that she's in. <br><br>Don't normally write in for things like this, but saw the movie listed
at another festival today and thought I should show my support to
say thanks for a very enjoyable and profound hour and a half.

I looked at the ratings system and don't understand what kind of secret
formula IMDb uses that works to the detriment of this film. Based on
how people have rated it, it should be a much higher score.<br><br>I say this because I just saw the film and thought it was amazing! Saw
it at a benefit screening in Santa Monica. I've never used IMDb before
and the filmmaker, who was at the screening, asked us to post something
here if we liked the film. So, I am. But also read the other
comments/ratings.<br><br>Anyway, I also read a bad review in the L.A. Times that was totally
hostile and completely at odds with what I, and my fellow audience
members, saw. Everyone I talked to loved the film and felt it was rich,
complex and deeply affecting. The review was shallow and pointless.
Ignore it - and others like it - and see this film for yourself. If you
do hate it, too, don't be afraid to say so here. But I'm betting most
of you will feel just the opposite. I did, anyway.

Jaques Thelemaque and Diane Gaidry are a husband and wife team that are
finding their voice as filmmakers through this story of Ellie, a quiet,
lost woman who is searching for her path in life. In this, their first
feature, they achieve storytelling of a much more mature level than
most first features. How wonderful to explore the hope that animals
provide us; we so often take that for granted. Pamela Gordon gives a
wonderful, gritty performance. No nonsense with her. Such a loss when
she passed away in real life. Go see this film, and watch for future
films by Jacques Thelemaque. Look up Diane Gaidry. She's been in
countless films recently as an actress, and recently won an award!
</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>
In the true spirit of independent film-making, writer/director Jacques
Thelemaque and his wife/ partner, gifted actress Diane Gaidry, create a
sensitive yet powerful film that is reminiscent of Cassavetes and
Rowland collaborations in the past. The late Pamela Gordon also gives a
stellar performance, as together this team puts a very truthful
portrayal, a slice of real life up on the screen. Dogwalker is a
touching story about healing old wounds and finding new friendship,
love and hope in rebuilding one's life. Thelemaque directs with a
master's touch, and his style reminds me of the best offerings from
John Sayles. The fact that both Thelemaque &amp; Gaidry are co-founders of
Filmmakers Alliance in Los Angeles, and that that very community
contributed immensely to making the film, sets them apart in the
independent world as leaders who put their money where their heart is,
and deliver the goods when they themselves are out in the field. To not
see this accomplishment of theirs is to doubt the very foundation of
independent film-making. And if you're a filmmaker, see this film and
celebrate in their triumph, so you can be inspired by what's possible
and aim high in your own aspirations.

The DOG WALKER is and extremely powerful film. If you are looking for a
""Hollywood"" film with a big named cast and heavy budget then this film
is not for you. I would encourage you not to watch it. Please don't
waste your time; this film doesn't have either aspect to it. It's
obvious when you go to sit down and watch the film that this is a
character driven independent film. If you can let go to the fact that
Julia Roberts isn't acting in this or Spielberg isn't directing this
with a thirty million dollar budget, then this film is for you. First
of all, the performance by Diane Gaidry, Pamela Godon and the rest of
the cast were real, which makes the story that much stronger. You have
to give credit to their strong screen presence do to the directing and
writing of Jacques Thelemaque. Not a dog fan? So what! The film is not
about ""dogs,"" it's about people and relationships. If you are a dog
fan, that's the perks for watching it. I'm not going to tell you to
watch this because you should support independent films. I am going to
tell you to watch it because it's a damn good film.

Very much in demand these days as a character player, Patricia Clarkson nevertheless continues to avoid the temptation of money-making mainstream filming while reaping kudos and acting awards in out-of-the-way projects.The New Orleans born-and-bred performer with the given name of Patricia Davies Clarkson was born on December 29, 1959, the daughter of Arthur (""Buzz"") Clarkson, a school administrator, and Jacquelyn (Brechtel) Clarkson, a local city politician and councilwoman. Patricia demonstrated an early interest in acting and managed to appear in a few junior high and high school-level plays while growing up. She took her basic college studies at Louisiana State University, studying speech for two years, before transferring to New York\'s Fordham University and graduating with honors in theatre arts.Accepted into the prestigious Yale School of Drama graduate program, she earned her Master of Fine Arts after gracing a wide range of productions including ""Electra,"" ""Pericles,"" ""Twelfth Night"", ""The Lower Depths,"" ""The Misanthrope,"" ""Pacific Overtures"" and ""La Ronde"". From there she took on New York City where she attracted strong East Coast notice in 1986 for her portrayal of Corrina in ""The House of Blue Leaves"" and in such other plays as ""Eastern Standard"" (1988) and ""Wolf-Man"" (1989).Known for her organic approach to acting, the flaxen-maned actress decided to try out her trademark whiskey voice in Hollywood at age 28, making her movie debut as Mrs. Eliot Ness in Brian De Palma\'s The Untouchables (1987) starring Kevin Costner. The following years she gained attention for playing Samantha Walker in The Dead Pool (1988) where she starred opposite Clint Eastwood\'s popular ""Dirty Harry"" character. Playing supportive, wifely types at the onset, she became a strong contender for character stardom by the mid-to-late 1990s, not only on stage but in the independent film arena.On stage Patricia received impressive notices for her contributions to the plays ""Raised in Captivity,"" ""The Ride Down Mt. Morgan,"" ""Three Days of Rain"" and, in particular, ""The Maiden\'s Prayer,"" which nabbed her both Outer Critics Circle and Drama Desk Award nominations. In 2004, she finally enacted the classic part she seemed born to play, that of Southern belle Blanche DuBois in the Kennedy Center production of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"". She earned glowing notices. On camera she was offered roles of marked diversity. From the heavier dramatics of a film like Pharaoh\'s Army (1995), she could move deftly into light comedy, courtesy of Neil Simon in the TV-movie London Suite (1996). It was, however, her bleak, convulsive portrayal of Greta, a strung-out, heroin-happy German has-been actress, opposite a resurgent Ally Sheedy in the acclaimed art film High Art (1998) that truly put Patricia on the indie map. From this she was handed a silver plate\'s worth of excitingly offbeat roles. In 2003 alone, Patricia received a special acting prize at the Sundance Film Festival for her superb work in three films: as a somber, grieving artist in The Station Agent (2003), a cold-hearted cancer victim in Pieces of April (2003) and a jokey, get-with-it mom in All the Real Girls (2003). She was nominated for a ""Supporting Actress"" Oscar for the second movie mentioned.On TV Patricia received two Emmys for her recurring guest part as Frances Conroy\'s free-spirited sister in the acclaimed black comedy series Six Feet Under (2001). She also received the New York Film Critics Circle and the National Society of Film Critics awards for her supporting work in the gorgeous, 1950s-styled melodrama Far from Heaven (2002), as a prim and proper Stepford-wife and deceptive friend to Julianne Moore.No matter the size, such as her extended cameos in The Green Mile (1999), All the Real Girls (2003), Miracle (2004) and Elegy (2008), Patricia manages to make the most of whatever screen time she has, often stealing scenes effortlessly. Seen everywhere because of her in-demand status in Hollywood, Patricia recently worked for director/actor Woody Allen. Impressed with her small but excellent contribution in Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008), she was promoted to a lead in his more recent picture Whatever Works (2009).- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net          Trivia (13)      Went to ivy-league Yale college to study dramatic arts.

In The Station Agent (2003) Michelle Williams played an acquaintance from the same small town as Patricia\'s character and in Pieces of April (2003) Patricia played the mother of the title character portrayed by Katie Holmes.      The youngest of five girls.      Has four sisters.      For a few years after Roger Dodger (2002) premiered at the 2002 Tribeca Film Festival, she was the girlfriend of Campbell Scott.      Close friend of Amy Ryan.      Nominated in the Outstanding Actress in Made for Television Movie FIVE, at The Women\'s Image Network (WIN) Awards 2012.      After working with director Will Gluck she vowed to star in every movie he would make from then on and subsequently starred in his films Friends with Benefits (2011) and Annie (2014).Personal Quotes (5)      There were some movies I passed on early on, and some movies I didn\'t get, some big studio films. But now I look back and I realize that I really came later in life to a kind of career. I was somewhat typecast as suburban ""mom"" type roles early on. But I\'ve always had this deep voice, so I think it was tough sometimes for directors to cast me as the ingÃ©nue. Because I\'d walk in and look a certain way, then open my mouth and have this...voice! So I think I sort of grew into my voice, my face, my body as I got older.      I think most people see me as much darker, more serious and possessing a certain gravitas, when I\'m really quite insane. I guess I want everyone to see my insanity. I have a far more nutty and unpredictable side.      I go where I need to go. If I need to look glamorous or spiffy or young, or battling cancer, or a drugged-out and hippie type, it hopefully will be projected in my face. That\'s the beauty of acting: hopefully it comes through. It\'s not about hair and makeup, a different color of hair. It\'s about being malleable. I just always hope it\'s going to work because you never know.      I\'ve dated several men with motorcycles. I would like to say I\'ve dated several poet laureates, but no. I\'ve dated several men with fucking motorcycles. Motorcycles make me love a man more. Any guy who has a motorcycle--you want to be on the back of his motorcycle, and if your feelings were slightly ambivalent, suddenly they\'re not. When you hang on, it\'s just wind. And sex. And speed, And hair.      [on her appearance in the famous ""Motherlover"" music video feat. Justin Timberlake] It was just an insane moment of my life, to be a part of that video. And one that will follow me the rest of my life. And one that, you know, you realize there are people in this world that only know me from this video. Oh my God, oh my God.

She left Hartford for a full scholarship in the Drama Division of The Juilliard School. After graduating from Juilliard, she performed extensively on the stage and developed a reputation as a talented stage actress, particularly in Shakespearian plays. In 1983, she starred in Joseph Papp\'s production of ""Hamlet"" at the New York Shakespeare Festival, in the lead role, the first woman to play the role at the New York Shakespeare Festival.In 1988, her critically acclaimed performance in Clint Eastwood\'s biographical feature of jazz great Charlie Parker, Bird (1988), as ""Chan Parker"", his wife, earned her a Golden Globe nomination and the New York Film Critics Award. These roles essentially made her famous.She was married to cinematographer Andrzej Bartkowiak (Speed (1994)) but later divorced him. After the divorce, she lived in New York with her daughter Madaket Bartkowiak, traveling often for work. She quit show business when Madzia was 8 to spend more time with her daughter. During her 7-year hiatus, Venora stayed close to home, teaching disadvantaged children, and acting in an occasional play. When Madzia was 15, Venora took her to Los Angeles and soon landed a starring role in the ABC series Thunder Alley (1994) playing Edward Asner\'s daughter and a recurring role in the Emmy award-winning series Chicago Hope (1994).In 1995, she starred opposite Al Pacino and Robert De Niro as Pacino\'s wife in Heat (1995), earning high regard from both critics and audiences for her of role of ""Justine Hanna"", caught in a troubled marriage. That performance, and her follow-up as Juliet\'s mother in William Shakespeare\'s Romeo + Juliet (1996) impressed the directors of both The Jackal (1997) and The 13th Warrior (1999) starring Antonio Banderas.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Cutter-2          Spouse (1) Andrzej Bartkowiak (1980            - 1989)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)          Trivia (5)      Was replaced on the TV sitcom Thunder Alley (1994) because the producers said that she was playing her role (Bobbi Turner) as if she were still on Broadway.

In the 1982-1983 season, she appeared on stage at the Public Theatre under the direction of Joseph Papp in the title role, making her the only female performer to take on the role in the history of the New York Shakespeare Festival. In 1990, she played ""Ophelia"" opposite Kevin Kline\'s ""Hamlet"". In 1999, she assailed the role of Hamlet\'s mother, ""Gertrude"", to Liev Schreiber\'s woeful prince. And, most recently, she again played ""Gertrude"" to Ethan Hawke\'s ""Hamlet"" in the 2000 film, Hamlet (2000).

He is of Irish and German descent. John was raised in Massachusetts, and received his BA from Bates College, which he achieved on debating and football scholarships. He then attended Yale University and earned an MFA in directing from its School of Drama.Following New York stage work, including his portrayal of Paris in a production of ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1977), initial on-camera notice came on TV with his reverential portrayal of Joseph in the mini-movie The Nativity (1978). A few years later on film he appeared in the small but memorable role of the impassioned, ill-fated American idealist who becomes a casualty to Chilean war-torn politics in Costa-Gavras\' Academy Award-winning thriller Missing (1982). Although Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek, who respectively played his despairing father and wife, were nominated for Oscars for their starring performances, John\'s role was central to the heart of the film and he made quite an impact. The actor was later honored by Amnesty International for his political work following the film\'s release.Critical kudos, as well as awards, have come in John\'s direction over the years on stage, film and TV. In the film Windy City (1984) opposite Kate Capshaw, he earned the Best Actor Award at the Montreal Film Festival. On stage, he received a Drama Desk Award for ""American Days"", an Obie Award for ""The Dining Room"" and a 1976 Theatre World Award for his portrayal of the Jewish student ""Avigdor"" in ""Yentl"". The role was later portrayed by Mandy Patinkin in Barbra Streisand\'s 1983 film adaptation. On television, John was awarded the coveted Emmy for his depiction of the distressed husband and father wannabe who touches off a legal landmark case in the miniseries, Baby M (1988).In a career pocked with remarkable versatility, interesting choices and challenging parts, John has played everything from a young Nazi in the miniseries Hitler\'s S.S.: Portrait in Evil (1985) to \'Robert F. Kennedy\' in the epic-styled Kennedy (1983). He has kept his face alive in guest parts over the years on such well-received series as Sex and the City (1998), Tales from the Crypt (1989), The Hitchhiker (1983), Law & Order (1990) and Medium (2005). A budding Irish-American filmmaker, John co-wrote, directed and appeared in the low-budget film Southie (1998), a drama set in the Irish-American section of Boston. The film won the Jury Award for Best Independent Film at the 1998 Seattle International Film Festival.Into the millennium, John found popularity on the Mutant X (2001) sci-fi series playing the role of ""Adam Kane"". Based on Marvel Comic\'s ""X-Men"", he received a nomination for Canada\'s prestigious Gemini Award as Best Actor. He also appears in a recurring role on Gossip Girl (2007). More recent filming includes a spat of thrillers including The Insurgents (2006) with Mary Stuart Masterson; the British Framed (2008) and the Indian drama Achchamundu! Achchamundu! (2009), plus the Jessica Alba drama, An Invisible Sign (2010), and the horror opus 51 (2011).A screenwriter and audio book performer in addition to all his other talents, John lives with his second wife, the painter Melissa MacLeod, and his family are based in New York and on Nantucket Island where he was a founding member of the Nantucket Film Festival and is Artistic Director of the Nantucket Theatre Workshop.

Preparing for his role as a sociopath in the French thriller Lune de miel (1985) [Honeymoon] opposite Nathalie Baye, John willingly entered himself into psychoanalysis in character in NYC\'s John Jay College of Criminal Justice. He also learned the French script and shot his scenes both in French and English.      Used Donald J. Trump and Richard III as character studies in preparing himself for the role of nemesis Lex Luthor in Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman (1993). During season two, he had to spend an average of three hours a day in the makeup chair to appear bald.      During the first rehearsal of the TV movie Family Reunion (1981), the legendary Bette Davis asked John, who was playing her grandson, whether he smoked or not. A very nervous John lied and said he did. The star then responded, ""Good, I can\'t stand men who don\'t smoke."" The young actor proceeded to light up two cigarettes at once, a la Paul Henreid in the Davis film Now, Voyager (1942), and gave one to Ms. Davis.      Made his Carnegie Hall debut playing the Soldier in Igor Stravinsky\'s ""The Soldier\'s Tale"" in 2002.      In preparation for an explicit nude scene in the British film Hussy (1980), in which John was making his film debut, the newcomer and his co-star Helen Mirren shared a bottle of red wine.      Appeared opposite Bianca Jagger in the play ""Daniella Frank,"" then later appeared with her ex-husband, Mick Jagger, in the movie Freejack (1992).      Only three men ever screen tested for the role of Indiana Jones for Steven Spielberg, John, Tom Selleck and, of course, Indiana himself, Harrison Ford.      While attending Bates College, he made his summer stock debut in Sean O\'Casey\'s ""Juno and the Paycock"" at the Nantucket Theatre Workshop. He is presently the Artistic Director of that same theatre.      Director Costa-Gavras spotted John playing a rock and roll producer in the stage play ""American Days"" at the Manhattan Theatre Club and immediately cast the actor in his critically-acclaimed film Missing (1982) without an audition.      Wore a blond wig, false teeth and spent three months studying Bobby Kennedy\'s pronounced accent in preparation for his role in the miniseries Kennedy (1983) opposite Martin Sheen as brother Jack.      For many years he played for the Hollywood All Stars, which was comprised of a group of actors who played charity baseball games around the country. He played three times at Yankee Stadium on teams that included Donald J. Trump, Michael Bolton, Al Pacino, Fisher Stevens, Al Franken, Paul Sorvino, Gregory Harrison and Meat Loaf.      While starring in London\'s West End production of Larry Kramer\'s ""The Normal Heart,"" John suddenly passed out on stage after being stricken by food poisoning. Literally carried off the stage, he was revived and managed to return to finish the performance.      Co-emceed the largest peace demonstration in American history, the June 12, 1982 anti-nuclear rally in Central Park, New York City. This later became the subject of the Robert Richter and Stanley Warnow documentary concert film In Our Hands (1984).      Became the first Hollywood actor to star in a Tamil-language film after being cast in the Indian thriller Achchamundu! Achchamundu! (2009).      In order to prepare for his role as a concert violinist opposite Kelly McGillis in the Isreali film Ha-Holmim (1987), John spent six months rehearsing a musical piece in New York, London and Tel Aviv for a performance scene lasting one minute.      John Shea auditioned for the role of ""Indiana Jones"" in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), alongside Karen Allen.      He has Irish and German ancestry.      At Bates College in Maine Shea ran track, played football captained the debating team, composed music, painted, and was co-editor of the literary magazine. He also acted, wrote plays, and directed them.Personal Quotes (1)      When I read a role, I try to find something that I can bring to the role and something that the role brings to me.

Neely (Chelsea Altman) is a struggling stage actress in Manhattan. Even
though all of her acting teachers proclaim her talent, she doesn't get
many gigs. Fortunately, her chef boyfriend, Tonio (Demian Bichir) is
patient enough to wait for her big break, although he longs for them to
reside in his homeland of Mexico. One day, after a heartbreaking
audition, Neely puts up a white flag and tells Tonio to start packing
for Guadelahara. But, just as they are to board a taxi to the airport,
a treasured friend tells her of a soap job that is casting that
afternoon. So, off Neely goes, in glasses and grubs. But, unknown to
her, the leading actress on the show, Heartbreak Hospital, is Sunday
(Diane Venora) and she doesn't want any competition in the looks
department. Thus, Neely gets the job after spouting only a few lines.
Oh, but Sunday hasn't seen her spiffed up! When Neely has her hair in

be in line to snag the leading man's heart! He's Milo (John Shea) and

happens to be Neely's neighbor. Having built an apartment ""altar"" to
Dr. Jonathan, wait until she finds out that Neely will be kissing her
dream physician! Green eyes will be flashing and, maybe, more. This is
a nice little take on shows like General Hospital and also that
roll-of-the-dice profession, acting. Luck seems to be the biggest
factor indeed. Venora does a nice turn as a narcissistic small screen
star, as does Shea. Meanwhile, Altman and the great-looking Bichir
provide a nice foil of reality. Clarkson, a fine actress, plays a
one-tone character as well as she can. No, the sets, costumes, and
other film amenities are nothing to write home about while the script
and direction are average contributions. However, if you adore romantic
comedy and have scads of time, Heartbreak Hospital might do for a
couple of hours.

He was an actor and director, known for Rosemary\'s Baby (1968), The Dirty Dozen (1967) and Opening Night (1977). He was married to Gena Rowlands. He died on February 3, 1989 in Los Angeles, California, USA.Spouse (1) Gena Rowlands (9 April\xa01954            - 3 February\xa01989)\xa0(his death)\xa0(3 children)          Trade Mark (2)        Extreme close-ups, with the image going in and out of focus        Realistic, documentary-like filmsTrivia (30)      Father of Nick Cassavetes, Xan Cassavetes and Zoe R. Cassavetes. Son of Nicholas John Cassavetes and Katherine Cassavetes.      Friend/actor Peter Falk said: ""Cassavetes was the most fervent man I ever met, and he didn\'t have a copy-cat bone in his body.""      A photograph of Cassavetes, taken during the production of his film Husbands (1970), appears on one stamp of a sheet of 10 USA 37Â¢ commemorative postage stamps, issued 25 February 2003, celebrating American Filmmaking: Behind the Scenes. The stamp honors directing.      Educated at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City.      Biography in: John Wakeman, editor. ""World Film Directors, Volume Two, 1945-1985"". Pages 189-194. New York: The H.W. Wilson Company, 1988.      Friend/actor Peter Falk said: \'Every Cassavetes film is always about the same thing. Somebody said \'Man is God in ruins,\' and John saw the ruins with a clarity that you and I could not tolerate.\'.      In Ray Carney\'s ""Cassavetes on Cassavetes"" book, Cassavetes confessed to his parents that he wanted to be an actor. His father wasn\'t initially thrilled at the idea of his son being an actor, but told him that he had to work hard because he would be portraying human emotions truthfully.      He was fully Greek in heritage.      Auditioned for The Actors Studio when he was starting out as an actor, but was rejected.      Despite many claiming that his films are improvised, it\'s actually a completed script that comes from improvised work by the actors. Another trademark of his films is that they\'re shot documentary-style.      He and Gena Rowlands made ten movies together: A Child Is Waiting (1963), Faces (1968), Gli intoccabili (1969), Minnie and Moskowitz (1971), A Woman Under the Influence (1974), Two-Minute Warning (1976), Opening Night (1977), Gloria (1980), Tempest (1982) and Love Streams (1984).      Directed 3 different actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Seymour Cassel, Lynn Carlin and Gena Rowlands.      He and his good friend Ben Gazzara made 5 movies together: Husbands (1970), Capone (1975), If It\'s Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium (1969), Opening Night (1977) and The Killing of a Chinese Bookie (1976)      He and close friend Peter Falk made six movies together: Gli intoccabili (1969), Husbands (1970), A Woman Under the Influence (1974), Mikey and Nicky (1976), Opening Night (1977), Big Trouble (1986), and one movie made for TV: Columbo: Ãtude in Black (1972).      As of 2007, he is one of only eight filmmakers to be nominated for best directing, writing, and acting Oscars over the course of their lifetime. The other seven are Orson Welles, Woody Allen, Warren Beatty, George Clooney, Roberto Benigni, John Huston and Kenneth Branagh.      Son-in-law of Lady Rowlands.      Brother-in-law of David Rowlands.      As of 2013, he is one of six men who has directed his wife to a Best Actress Oscar nomination, and is the only one to have directed her to two such nominations (Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence (1974) and Gloria (1980)). The other five are Paul Czinner directing Elisabeth Bergner in Escape Me Never (1935), Paul Newman directing Joanne Woodward in Rachel, Rachel (1968), Richard Brooks directing Jean Simmons in The Happy Ending (1969), Blake Edwards directing Julie Andrews in Victor Victoria (1982), and Joel Coen directing Frances McDormand in Fargo (1996). Jules Dassin also directed his future wife Melina Mercouri in a Best Actress Oscar-nominated performance (Pote tin Kyriaki (1960)), though they were not yet married at the time of the nomination.      One of the screening rooms at the Thessaloniki Film Festival is named after him.      Adhered to the Stanislavsky School of Method Acting and taught acting classes in 1956 (in his own workshop that he started) prior to making the film Shadows (1959) .      Acted in films by other directors in order to finance his own projects.      While some of his Hollywood films (such as Too Late Blues (1961)) lost money, his own movies were often hugely successful. Shadows (1959), filmed with non-professional actors on the streets of New York with a hand-held camera on 16mm black & white film, cost a mere $40,000 and recouped its cost many times over, winning the 1960 Critics Award at the Venice Film Festival. Another of his films, Faces (1968), cost $1 million and made ten times as much in profits, as well as taking out another five prizes in Venice in 1970.      Actor and film director who was regarded as a pioneer of American cinema veritÃ©.      The New Yorker magazine said in 2013 that Cassavetes ""may be the most influential American director of the last half century"" --this on the eve of the screening of all of the films he directed, at the BAM Theater in Brooklyn, NY throughout July 2013.      He was considered for the role of Tom Hagen in The Godfather (1972) before Robert Duvall was cast.      Retrospective: Screening of all the films Cassavetes directed, plus some he acted in, at Brooklyn Academy of Music, July 6-31. [July 2013]      He played the brother of his real life wife Gena Rowlands in Love Streams (1984).      Retrospective at the 1st American Film Festival (2010) in Wroclaw, Poland.      He directed Val Avery in five films: Too Late Blues (1961), Faces (1968), Minnie and Moskowitz (1971), The Killing of a Chinese Bookie (1976) and Gloria (1980).      He directed Fred Draper in five films: A Child Is Waiting (1963), Faces (1968), Husbands (1970), A Woman Under the Influence (1974) and Opening Night (1977).Personal Quotes (15)      I\'m sort of my own Mafia, you know, breaking my own knees.      There\'s a difference between ad-libbing and improvising. And there\'s a difference between not knowing what to do and just saying something. Or making choices as an actor. As a writer also, as a person who\'s making a film, as a cameraman, everything is a choice. And it seems to me I don\'t really have to direct anyone or write down that somebody\'s getting drunk; all I have to do is say that there\'s a bottle there and put a bottle there and then they\'re going to get drunk. I don\'t want to tell them how they\'re going to get drunk. I don\'t want to tell them how they\'re going to get drunk, or what they would do, and I don\'t want to restrict them in being able to carry out a beat, to fulfill an action. You can\'t say somebody\'s drunk, or in love.Ricardo Montalban is to improvisational acting what Mount Rushmore is to animation.      As an artist, I feel that we must try many things - but above all we must dare to fail.      People have forgotten how to relate or respond; what I\'m trying to do with my movies is build something audiences can respond to.      When I started making films, I wanted to make Frank Capra pictures. But I\'ve never been able to make anything but these crazy, tough pictures. You are what you are.      Say what you are. Not what you would like to be. Not what you have to be. Just say what you are. And what you are is good enough.      Everyone has made a love, religion, god. Time magazine had the audacity to kill God and those people are floundering and walking around the world with nothing in their lives, simply because they are not led by anybody with responsibility.      In the last couple of decades or so, something has happened to the American dream. I don\'t quite know what it is, and it\'s still not very clear in my mind. Confusion has replaced patriotism. The intellect has replaced love. If something doesn\'t make money, no one is interested. Everything is for sale. Emotions are sold. Sex is sold. Everything is sex. Cars, women, clothes, your face, your hands, your shoes! Look at the ads, at television. My emotions aren\'t for sale. My thoughts can\'t be bought. They\'re mine. I don\'t want movies that sell me something. I don\'t want to be told how to feel.      [on Gena Rowlands] She and I have friction in terms of lifestyle and taste. We agree in taste on nothing. She thinks so totally opposite to anything I would ever conceive!      I\'m not really a director. I\'m a man who believes in the validity of a person\'s inner desires. And I think those inner desires, whether they\'re ugly or beautiful, are pertinent to each of us and are probably the only things worth a damn. I want to put those inner dreams on the screen so we can all look and think and feel and marvel at them.      I\'m not part of anything. I never joined anything. I could work anywhere.      [on Love Streams (1984)] This picture, this picture; I don\'t give a fuck what anybody says. If you don\'t have time to see it, don\'t. If you don\'t like it, don\'t. If it doesn\'t give you an answer, fuck you. I didn\'t make it for you anyway.      [on the ending of Love Streams (1984)] I\'m crazy, but I love this fucking movie. They hate it, but I love their faces. This is when we should begin the movie. This is the beginning. Now she goes home and the movie begins. Fuck \'em if they want answers. Fuck \'em!      I\'m a professional actor out of defense. I\'d prefer to be an amateur actor. But I\'ve got to have money to make films. Unfortunately, it\'s an extremely expensive hobby.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nJohn Ireland ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 19 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(3)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(8)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(1)\xa0|Salary\xa0(1)  Overview (4)Date of Birth30\xa0January1914,\xa0Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Date of Death21\xa0March1992,\xa0Santa Barbara, California, USA      \xa0(leukemia)    Birth NameJohn Benjamin IrelandHeight6\'\xa01""\xa0(1.85\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Born in Canada, John Ireland was raised in New York. Performing as a swimmer in a water carnival, he moved into the legitimate theater, often appearing in minor roles in Broadway plays. His first big break in pictures came in 1945 when he appeared as Windy the introspective letter-writing G.I. in the classic war epic A Walk in the Sun (1945). Ireland was then often featured (mostly as a heavy) in several films. In 1949, he was nominated for best supporting actor for his role as the reporter in All the King\'s Men (1949). During the early 1950s, Ireland often starred as the emoting, brooding hero, almost exclusively in ""B"" pictures. In 1953, with his son Peter Ireland and wife, Joanne Dru, Ireland co-produced and co-directed the western mini-classic Hannah Lee: An American Primitive (1953) (aka Outlaw Territory). From the mid-\'50s on. he appeared mainly in Italian ""quickie"" features and showed up occasionally in supporting roles in major pictures (Spartacus (1960)). Occasionally, his name was mentioned in tabloids of the times, in connection with young starlets, namely Natalie Wood and Sue Lyon.

John Hough's horror films are a mixed bunch, but this one is far more
interesting than its horrendous critical reception would suggest. It is
ostensibly a detective story of a small town policeman (John Cassavetes)
investigating a series of unusually vicious rape homicides.  Hough uses the
structure to raise some provocative questions about penetration as
violation.  Sex and violence as one, forged and bonded in repression,
resentment, sadism and envy.<br><br>The film is riddled with hints of the incestuous desire the protagonist
has for his daughter.  Hough thus plays with audience identification,
seeking to implicate the viewer in a repulsive sexuality which, in a graphic

necrophilia.  The otherwise conventional plot is spiced up by a
contemplation of p.o.v. as moderating aberrant sexuality.  No wonder that
critics and audiences found the film overly offensive and distasteful.

I picked up this one solely on the basis of its having John Cassavetes in
it.  Yes, it is low-budget, but despite that -- or maybe because of it --
the film is surprisingly effective.  It's creepy.  There's some gore but
the
slicing &amp; dicing is almost all off-camera.  With the exception of one scene
about mid-movie, we don't see any of it.  That works to make the movie more
eerie -- we aren't distracted by the gross-out effect.<br><br>Cassavetes shows his talent -- he can make the worst dialogue sound
believable.  Unfortunately, the side effect of this is to make his
coworkers
sound even worse than they might have.  Because a lot of the dialogue in
this movie does stink out loud.  On the other hand, there were a number of
interesting scenes where you expected someone to break out in positively
bad, cliched dialogue and instead -- nothing was said.<br><br>Others have commented on the creepiness of the doctor's quasi-incestuous

is something that almost never gets shown.<br><br>Summary:  good if you want to see a creepy movie with a great actor and

I saw this movie about three years ago on a defective rental tape, and I
must say that I was shocked. I was shocked at how a film dealing with
supernatural rape and mutilation can be so...conventional! Yes, you read it
right. When the screen isn't gushing blood at regular intervals, the movie
is actually a run-of-the-mill slasher-mystery, with stilted dialogue and
unimaginative presentation (though the movie-theater sequence shows some
flair). And talk about your surprise endings!<br><br>The acting is bland; even John Cassavetes (who I guess had some bills to pay
that month) seems preoccupied. In fact, despite the aforementioned
brutality, the production seems altogether too restrained. It's as if,
despite the lurid subject matter, the filmmakers didn't want to make an
exploitation picture--even though they can't make the material work on any
other level. As a result, the more sensationalistic elements are balanced
out by indifferent ""human drama"" involving a bunch of not-very-interesting
characters. The occasional stabs at depth (""I don't WANT tenderness!"") range
from just plain ineffective to full-out laughable. But the final product
(which cost more than you might think) isn't laughable, but merely mediocre.
It did have potential, but instead it just sort of...is.

Seriously, I can easily stomach a lot of on screen blood, gore and
repulsiveness, but what really makes this film disturbing &amp;
uncomfortable to watch is how the doctor character keeps on rambling
about the physical damage done to raped women. He, John Cassavetes of
""Rosemary's Baby"", talks about ruptured uterus, dry intercourse and
massive loads of reddish (?) sperm like they are the most common little
ailments in the world of medicine. That being said, ""Incubus"" is an
ultimately STRANGE horror effort. It isn't necessarily awful Â although
it isn't very good, neither Â but just plain weird. The muddled &amp;
incoherent script initially revolves on the hunt for a rapist-killer of
flesh and blood (even though the title clearly suggests the involvement
of a supernatural creature) and it never seems to stop introducing new
characters. None of these characters, especially not the main ones,
come across as sympathetic and for some never-explained reason they all
seem to keep dark secrets. The aforementioned doctor has an odd
interpretation of daughter-love and continuously behaves like he's a
suspect himself, the town's sheriff (John Ireland) appears to be in a
constant state of drunkenness and doesn't even seem to care about who
keeps raping &amp; killing the women in his district, the female reporter
is even too weird for words and the Galens (an old witch and her
grandson) are just plain spooky. All together they desperately try to
solve the mystery of whom or what exactly is destroying the towns'
women reproducing organs. The sequences building up towards the rapes &amp;
murders are admirably atmospheric and the vile acts themselves are
bloody and unsettling. Basically these are very positive factors in a
horror film, but the narrative structure is too incoherent and the
characters are too unsympathetic for ""Incubus"" to be a really good
film. Also, there are quite a few tedious parts to struggle yourself
through (like footage of a Bruce Dickinson concert!) and the usually
very reliable John Hough's direction is nearly unnoticeable. The final
shot is effectively nightmarish, though. For me personally, ""Incubus""
was a bit of a disappointment, but there are still several enough
reasons to recommend this odd piece of early 80's horror to open-minded
genre fanatics.

John Cassavetes stars as a surgeon in a small New England town where a
series of bizarre rapes-turned-murders are occurring left and right
against the area's female residents. Thrown into the mix is his
teenager daughter whose boyfriend claims to be witnessing the crimes as
they are occurring within nightmares he experiences.<br><br>As far as I'm concerned, John Hough is one of horror's unsung heroes
when it comes to mood and atmosphereÂ if ""The Legend of Hell House"" or
the marginal Disney thriller ""The Watcher in the Woods"" aren't enough
proof of that, ""The Incubus"" is. This dreary thriller is considerably
more violent than Hough's other horror pictures, but has his signature
stylistics that I absolutely love. <br><br>Like in most of all Hough's work, the cinematography is slick and
thoughtful, making goosebumps-inducing use of POV shots. In the film,
the camera follows the victims almost like a predator before launching
its vicious assault, and each attack is just as effective as the next.
There is also a substantial Gothic feel underpinning the events, and
the photography accentuates the beauty of New England landscapes (even
in spite of the Canadian shooting locales). The musty and discomforting
atmosphere of the film is underlined by an unnerving score, another
signature element of Hough's films. A somewhat withered Cassavetes is
still on his game here, with John Ireland supporting as the miffed
sheriff and Kerri Keane as a nosy local reporter.<br><br>The chilly, Gothic autumnal environment in which the film takes place
is entirely disrupted by its explicit sexual violence, and it features
some of the most disturbing and visceral assault scenes I've ever seen
in a horror film (the library sequence near the beginning especially
stands out). The script's medley of violence and female sexuality under
attack is fascinating in its repulsive representation, and even more
bizarre are the incestuous undertones and gender-bending revelation at
the film's twisted conclusion. While the finale is irrefutably shocking
(and the monster makeup surprisingly scary, even by today's standards),
I can say that the narrative build-up could have been a tad better
handled as it all does seem to come crashing down rather awkwardly; a
bit more finesse in script and editing could have remedied this, but
the film still works in spite of it.<br><br>Overall, I found ""The Incubus"" to be a formidable and disturbing film;
Hough's handling of the rural New England locale is fantastic in
atmosphere and tone, and effective, moody cinematography really
establishes a menacing and inauspicious feel. The film's one major flaw
is the hackneyed pacing in its last act, but I personally found this a
forgivable sin amidst the movie's audacious presentation of sexual
violence and generally grim demeanor. This is definitely one of the
more aggressive horror films of its era in terms of thematics, but the
quaint and Gothic feel hearkens back to a more classical and almost
British sensibility. A fantastic thriller best suited for viewing on a
chilly autumn night with all the lights off. 8/10.

Horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic doesn't always win out over
imagination.  We all know that killers like Freddy, Jason, Michael and even
Leatherface shouldn't be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and
still live to fight another day.  Most of us don't believe that zombies
really rise from the dead to stalk people and eat their brains.  And let's
hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like
Funhouses and old mansions that unspeakable crimes are not going to be
perpetrated against them.  This is where imagination wins out over fact. 
Horror, and most films in general, requires us to suspend our disbelief for
a couple of hours and just go with the flow.  This usually isn't a problem
when I watch bouncing balls being hurled down the stairs at George C. Scott
or when I see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the
woods near Burketsville.  But what I do have a problem digesting ( without
wanting to regurgitate ) is when a film has a killer like the one in this
film.  To give away who the killer is would actually be a huge spoiler and
it would take away all fun of watching it for yourself, but just suffice to
say that I actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene when the
killer is revealed.  There are too many events in the film that transpire
for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is.  But the 90 minutes
prior to this point is a well done, suspenseful, blood soaked film directed
with panache and skill by John Hough.  If the film would have offered me a
different killer, then I would actually be raving about it.  This may sound
like a completely asinine reason to discredit the film, but believe me,
anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with
me.<br><br>John Cassevetes plays Dr. Sam Cordell.  He and his daughter Jenny ( played
beautifully by Erin Flannery ) have just recently moved to this small New
England town.  Cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife
died.  We see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman ( one can only
presume it is his wife ) is laying backside on the ground during a
torrential downpour.  Her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed.  Again,
I am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but
she is there anyway.  Cassevetes, it has to be mentioned, is strange to say
the least.  Cordell is a loving father but his love for his daughter seems
to be a little more than just parental.  There are a few scenes that hint of
incestuous possibilities.  It never comes to fruition but it just seems to
be omnipotent, but somewhere just beneath the proverbial rug.  Thankfully
the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does
make you a little uneasy.  <br><br>Casevettes seems like a cross between the porno actor John Leslie and screen
great James Caan.  He has a deceptive smile and a virile, commanding voice
that makes you sit up and take notice.  But he also looks like he is about
to disrobe during a business luncheon in every scene.  He just has that
slimy, disingenuous, phlegmatic, uneasy way about him.  He never really
looks like he can be trusted in this film.  I guess that is a credit to the
writers, the director and to Cassevetes himself.  There was always something
that just bothered me about his character from the get-go. <br><br>The story begins on an excellent note as two would be lovers are swimming in
the local quarry.  There is a rickety old changing shed near by and as we
can see, something or someone is watching them.  When the young man briefly
disappears to get something from the truck, the young woman wanders into the
shed, just to play a prank.  Once she is there, she is attacked.  The young
man dashes to the shed to find her and he is impaled with a board and nail. 
Hough shrewdly sets us up for the payoff pitch when the young man comes in. 
He looks frantically scours the room and spots his would-be lover bleeding
in the corner, and then smacko, the guy gets it.  It is a very tense moment
and it starts the film off on the correct note.<br><br>Also introduced into the tangled wed of a story is a young man named Tim
that seems to be having strange dreams of a faceless woman that is bound in
a torture chamber surrounded by men with cloaks covering their faces.  Tim
seems to think that his dreams have something to do with the murders because
every time a murder takes place, he has another dream. Toss in a quiet and
turbid grandmother, a meretricious female reporter and a strong yet venal
local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the
makings of an imbroglio in the small town of Galen.<br><br>Throughout the film more people are massacred but most of the time, the
males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped. 
This is my first feeble (and careful) attempt to tell you that this is what
left me unconvinced with the denouement.  It just didn't strike the right
chord.<br><br>The Incubus is a well done film.  It is tense, tight and even most of the
performances are very well done.  I was intrigued by the dreams that Tim was
having and I was anxious to find out what significance they had to the story
and ultimately to the murders.  But when you get through all that was good
in the film, you are still left with that acerbic taste in your mouth.  And
bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones. <br><br>7 out of 10-- This could have been a nine.  Too bad.

Sam Cordell (John Cassavetes) is impressed with the violence and
realizes that Mandy has had the uterus ruptured. Then the librarian
Carolyn Davies (Denise Fergusson) is also violently raped and murdered.
Lieutenant Drivas (Harry Ditson) believes that the women have been
raped by a gang while Sam and Sheriff Hank Walden (John Ireland)
believe that only one man did. The snoopy reporter Laura Kincaid
(Kerrie Keane) is always interfering with the investigation and Sam has
a love affair with her. Meanwhile the young Tim Galen (Duncan
McIntosh), who dates Sam's daughter Jenny Cordell (Erin Flannery),
discloses that he has premonitory visions of the deaths, but his
grandmother Agatha Galen (Helen Hughes) tries to convince him that he
has nothing to do with the murders. But when Jenny learns about his
dreams, she summons her father and Laura and they discover a
supernatural secret about the Galen's family.<br><br>""Incubus"" is a horror movie with an intriguing story, good cast
including John Cassavetes and beautiful cinematography. Unfortunately
the screenplay is not well written and characters are left behind
without explanation. The worst, the deceptive conclusion is awful. My
vote is five.<br><br>Title (Brazil): ""Incubus""

A brutal rapist is on the loose in a small Wisconsin town,and Dr.Sam
Cordell(John Cassavetes)suspects his daughter's boyfriend,until the
horrible truth is discovered-the rapes and killings are committed by a
mysterious demon.""The Incubus"" is an above average horror film that has
slick production values and nice-looking professional actors.There are
some gory scenes like wonderful moment where one guy has a shovel
shoved into his neck.There is also a gratuitous shower scene,so fans of
nudity won't be disappointed.The film is truly creepy,unfortunately the
action is rather slow.The film's director John Hough,has had uneven
career at best,but he is primarily known for having helmed ""The Legend
of Hell House"",a very creepy horror film that has to be seen to be
believed.Anyway,give this one a look if you're a real horror
buff.Highly recommended.

I saw this movie about three years ago on a defective rental tape, and I
must say that I was shocked. I was shocked at how a film dealing with
supernatural rape and mutilation can be so...conventional! Yes, you read it
right. When the screen isn't gushing blood at regular intervals, the movie
is actually a run-of-the-mill slasher-mystery, with stilted dialogue and
unimaginative presentation (though the movie-theater sequence shows some
flair). And talk about your surprise endings!<br><br>The acting is bland; even John Cassavetes (who I guess had some bills to pay
that month) seems preoccupied. In fact, despite the aforementioned
brutality, the production seems altogether too restrained. It's as if,
despite the lurid subject matter, the filmmakers didn't want to make an
exploitation picture--even though they can't make the material work on any
other level. As a result, the more sensationalistic elements are balanced
out by indifferent ""human drama"" involving a bunch of not-very-interesting
characters. The occasional stabs at depth (""I don't WANT tenderness!"") range
from just plain ineffective to full-out laughable. But the final product
(which cost more than you might think) isn't laughable, but merely mediocre.
It did have potential, but instead it just sort of...is.

Seriously, I can easily stomach a lot of on screen blood, gore and
repulsiveness, but what really makes this film disturbing &amp;
uncomfortable to watch is how the doctor character keeps on rambling
about the physical damage done to raped women. He, John Cassavetes of
""Rosemary's Baby"", talks about ruptured uterus, dry intercourse and
massive loads of reddish (?) sperm like they are the most common little
ailments in the world of medicine. That being said, ""Incubus"" is an
ultimately STRANGE horror effort. It isn't necessarily awful Â although
it isn't very good, neither Â but just plain weird. The muddled &amp;
incoherent script initially revolves on the hunt for a rapist-killer of
flesh and blood (even though the title clearly suggests the involvement
of a supernatural creature) and it never seems to stop introducing new
characters. None of these characters, especially not the main ones,
come across as sympathetic and for some never-explained reason they all
seem to keep dark secrets. The aforementioned doctor has an odd
interpretation of daughter-love and continuously behaves like he's a
suspect himself, the town's sheriff (John Ireland) appears to be in a
constant state of drunkenness and doesn't even seem to care about who
keeps raping &amp; killing the women in his district, the female reporter
is even too weird for words and the Galens (an old witch and her
grandson) are just plain spooky. All together they desperately try to
solve the mystery of whom or what exactly is destroying the towns'
women reproducing organs. The sequences building up towards the rapes &amp;
murders are admirably atmospheric and the vile acts themselves are
bloody and unsettling. Basically these are very positive factors in a
horror film, but the narrative structure is too incoherent and the
characters are too unsympathetic for ""Incubus"" to be a really good
film. Also, there are quite a few tedious parts to struggle yourself
through (like footage of a Bruce Dickinson concert!) and the usually
very reliable John Hough's direction is nearly unnoticeable. The final
shot is effectively nightmarish, though. For me personally, ""Incubus""
was a bit of a disappointment, but there are still several enough
reasons to recommend this odd piece of early 80's horror to open-minded
genre fanatics.

John Cassavetes stars as a surgeon in a small New England town where a
series of bizarre rapes-turned-murders are occurring left and right
against the area's female residents. Thrown into the mix is his
teenager daughter whose boyfriend claims to be witnessing the crimes as
they are occurring within nightmares he experiences.<br><br>As far as I'm concerned, John Hough is one of horror's unsung heroes
when it comes to mood and atmosphereÂ if ""The Legend of Hell House"" or
the marginal Disney thriller ""The Watcher in the Woods"" aren't enough
proof of that, ""The Incubus"" is. This dreary thriller is considerably
more violent than Hough's other horror pictures, but has his signature
stylistics that I absolutely love. <br><br>Like in most of all Hough's work, the cinematography is slick and
thoughtful, making goosebumps-inducing use of POV shots. In the film,
the camera follows the victims almost like a predator before launching
its vicious assault, and each attack is just as effective as the next.
There is also a substantial Gothic feel underpinning the events, and
the photography accentuates the beauty of New England landscapes (even
in spite of the Canadian shooting locales). The musty and discomforting
atmosphere of the film is underlined by an unnerving score, another
signature element of Hough's films. A somewhat withered Cassavetes is
still on his game here, with John Ireland supporting as the miffed
sheriff and Kerri Keane as a nosy local reporter.<br><br>The chilly, Gothic autumnal environment in which the film takes place
is entirely disrupted by its explicit sexual violence, and it features
some of the most disturbing and visceral assault scenes I've ever seen
in a horror film (the library sequence near the beginning especially
stands out). The script's medley of violence and female sexuality under
attack is fascinating in its repulsive representation, and even more
bizarre are the incestuous undertones and gender-bending revelation at
the film's twisted conclusion. While the finale is irrefutably shocking
(and the monster makeup surprisingly scary, even by today's standards),
I can say that the narrative build-up could have been a tad better
handled as it all does seem to come crashing down rather awkwardly; a
bit more finesse in script and editing could have remedied this, but
the film still works in spite of it.<br><br>Overall, I found ""The Incubus"" to be a formidable and disturbing film;
Hough's handling of the rural New England locale is fantastic in
atmosphere and tone, and effective, moody cinematography really
establishes a menacing and inauspicious feel. The film's one major flaw
is the hackneyed pacing in its last act, but I personally found this a
forgivable sin amidst the movie's audacious presentation of sexual
violence and generally grim demeanor. This is definitely one of the
more aggressive horror films of its era in terms of thematics, but the
quaint and Gothic feel hearkens back to a more classical and almost
British sensibility. A fantastic thriller best suited for viewing on a
chilly autumn night with all the lights off. 8/10.

Horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic doesn't always win out over
imagination.  We all know that killers like Freddy, Jason, Michael and even
Leatherface shouldn't be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and
still live to fight another day.  Most of us don't believe that zombies
really rise from the dead to stalk people and eat their brains.  And let's
hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like
Funhouses and old mansions that unspeakable crimes are not going to be
perpetrated against them.  This is where imagination wins out over fact. 
Horror, and most films in general, requires us to suspend our disbelief for
a couple of hours and just go with the flow.  This usually isn't a problem
when I watch bouncing balls being hurled down the stairs at George C. Scott
or when I see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the
woods near Burketsville.  But what I do have a problem digesting ( without
wanting to regurgitate ) is when a film has a killer like the one in this
film.  To give away who the killer is would actually be a huge spoiler and
it would take away all fun of watching it for yourself, but just suffice to
say that I actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene when the
killer is revealed.  There are too many events in the film that transpire
for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is.  But the 90 minutes
prior to this point is a well done, suspenseful, blood soaked film directed
with panache and skill by John Hough.  If the film would have offered me a
different killer, then I would actually be raving about it.  This may sound
like a completely asinine reason to discredit the film, but believe me,
anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with
me.<br><br>John Cassevetes plays Dr. Sam Cordell.  He and his daughter Jenny ( played
beautifully by Erin Flannery ) have just recently moved to this small New
England town.  Cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife
died.  We see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman ( one can only
presume it is his wife ) is laying backside on the ground during a
torrential downpour.  Her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed.  Again,
I am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but
she is there anyway.  Cassevetes, it has to be mentioned, is strange to say
the least.  Cordell is a loving father but his love for his daughter seems
to be a little more than just parental.  There are a few scenes that hint of
incestuous possibilities.  It never comes to fruition but it just seems to
be omnipotent, but somewhere just beneath the proverbial rug.  Thankfully
the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does
make you a little uneasy.  <br><br>Casevettes seems like a cross between the porno actor John Leslie and screen
great James Caan.  He has a deceptive smile and a virile, commanding voice
that makes you sit up and take notice.  But he also looks like he is about
to disrobe during a business luncheon in every scene.  He just has that
slimy, disingenuous, phlegmatic, uneasy way about him.  He never really
looks like he can be trusted in this film.  I guess that is a credit to the
writers, the director and to Cassevetes himself.  There was always something
that just bothered me about his character from the get-go. <br><br>The story begins on an excellent note as two would be lovers are swimming in
the local quarry.  There is a rickety old changing shed near by and as we
can see, something or someone is watching them.  When the young man briefly
disappears to get something from the truck, the young woman wanders into the
shed, just to play a prank.  Once she is there, she is attacked.  The young
man dashes to the shed to find her and he is impaled with a board and nail. 
Hough shrewdly sets us up for the payoff pitch when the young man comes in. 
He looks frantically scours the room and spots his would-be lover bleeding
in the corner, and then smacko, the guy gets it.  It is a very tense moment
and it starts the film off on the correct note.<br><br>Also introduced into the tangled wed of a story is a young man named Tim
that seems to be having strange dreams of a faceless woman that is bound in
a torture chamber surrounded by men with cloaks covering their faces.  Tim
seems to think that his dreams have something to do with the murders because
every time a murder takes place, he has another dream. Toss in a quiet and
turbid grandmother, a meretricious female reporter and a strong yet venal
local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the
makings of an imbroglio in the small town of Galen.<br><br>Throughout the film more people are massacred but most of the time, the
males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped. 
This is my first feeble (and careful) attempt to tell you that this is what
left me unconvinced with the denouement.  It just didn't strike the right
chord.<br><br>The Incubus is a well done film.  It is tense, tight and even most of the
performances are very well done.  I was intrigued by the dreams that Tim was
having and I was anxious to find out what significance they had to the story
and ultimately to the murders.  But when you get through all that was good
in the film, you are still left with that acerbic taste in your mouth.  And
bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones. <br><br>7 out of 10-- This could have been a nine.  Too bad.

He played further comedic roles in Mr. Mom (1983), Johnny Dangerously (1984), and Beetlejuice (1988), earned further acclaim for his dramatic portrayal of Bruce Wayne / Batman in Tim Burton\'s Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992), and since then, has moved easily between film genres, ranging from drama and romantic comedy to thriller and action.Keaton was born Michael John Douglas on September 5, 1951 in Coraopolis, Pennsylvannia, to Leona Elizabeth (Loftus), a homemaker, and George A. Douglas, a civil engineer and surveyor. He is of Irish, as well as English, Scottish, and German, descent. Michael studied speech for two years at Kent State, before dropping out and moving to Pittsburgh. An unsuccessful attempt at stand-up comedy led Keaton to working as a TV cameraman in a cable station, and he came to realize he wanted to work in front of the cameras. Keaton first appeared on TV in several episodes of MisteRogers\' Neighborhood (1968).He left Pittsburgh and moved to Los Angeles to begin auditioning for TV. He began cropping up in popular TV shows including Maude (1972) and The Mary Tyler Moore Hour (1979). Around this time, Keaton decided to use an alternative surname to remove confusion with better-known actor Michael Douglas. After reading an article on actress Diane Keaton, he decided that Michael Keaton sounded good. His next break was scoring a co-starring role alongside Jim Belushi in the short-lived comedy series Working Stiffs (1979), which showcased his comedic talent and led to his co-starring role in Night Shift (1982). Keaton next scored the lead in the comedy hits Mr. Mom (1983), Johnny Dangerously (1984) , Gung Ho (1986), the Tim Burton horror-comedy Beetlejuice (1988), and The Dream Team (1989).Keaton\'s career was given another major boost when he was again cast by Tim Burton, this time as the title comic book superhero, millionaire playboy / crime-fighter Bruce Wayne, in Batman (1989). Burton cast him because he thought that Keaton was the only actor who could portray someone who has the kind of darkly obsessive personality that the character demands. To say there were howls of protest by fans of the caped crusader comic strip is an understatement! Warner Bros. was deluged with thousands of letters of complaint commenting that comedian Keaton was the wrong choice for the Caped Crusader, given his prior work and the fact that he lacked the suave, handsome features and tall, muscular physicality often attributed to the character in the comic books. However, their fears were proven wrong when Keaton turned in a sensational performance, and he held his own on screen with opponent Jack Nicholson, playing the lunatic villain, ""The Joker"". Keaton\'s dramatic work earned widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike, and Batman (1989) became one of the most successful films of the year.Keaton remained active during the 1990s, appearing in a wide range of films. Keen to diversify his work, Keaton starred as a psychotic tenant in Pacific Heights (1990), as a hard-working cop in One Good Cop (1991), and then donned the black cape and cowl once more for Batman Returns (1992). He remained in demand during the 1990s, appearing in a wide range of films, including the star-studded Shakespearian Much Ado About Nothing (1993), the drama My Life (1993), another Ron Howard comedy The Paper (1994), with sexy Andie MacDowell in Multiplicity (1996), twice in the same role, dogged Elmore Leonard character Agent Ray Nicolette, in Jackie Brown (1997) and Out of Sight (1998). He also played a killer in the mediocre thriller Desperate Measures (1998).In the 2000s, Keaton appeared in several productions with mixed success, including Live from Baghdad (2002), First Daughter (2004), and Herbie Fully Loaded (2005). He also provided voices for characters in the animated films Cars (2006), Toy Story 3 (2010), and Minions (2015).He returned to major film roles in the 2010s, co-starring in The Other Guys (2010), RoboCop (2014) and Need for Speed (2014). Also that year, Keaton starred alongside Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts in Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014), a film by 21 Grams (2003) and Biutiful (2010) director Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rritu. In the film, Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a screen actor, famous for playing the iconic titular superhero, who puts on a Broadway play based on a Raymond Carver short story, to regain his former glory. Keaton\'s critically praised lead performance earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, the Critics\' Choice Award for Best Actor and Best Actor in a Comedy, and nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award, British Academy Film Award, and Academy Award for Best Actor.In 2015, he played a journalist in Spotlight (2015), which, like Birdman, won the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 2016, he starred as Ray Kroc, the developer of McDonald\'s, in the drama The Founder (2016).He is a visiting scholar at Carnegie Mellon University.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       firehouse44 and Pedro Borges          Spouse (1) Caroline McWilliams (5 June\xa01982            - 29 January\xa01990)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)          Trivia (53)      When he realized he needed to change his name to join the union, he was in the K\'s for surnames and thought it inoffensive so chose Keaton. It is a misconception that it was after Diane Keaton.      Was in a relationship with Courteney Cox from 1989-95.      Has a home in Pacific Palisades (CA) plus ranches in Santa Barbara (CA) and Montana. The 1000-acre Montana ranch, where he grows hay and raises cattle, features a four-bedroom cedar-and-stone ranch house.Tim Burton cast him in the title role of Batman (1989) because he thought that Keaton was the only actor who could believably portray someone who has the kind of darkly obsessive personality that the character has. There was a great deal of fan anger over his selection, forcing the studio to release an advance trailer both to show that Keaton could do the role well and that the movie would not be a campy parody like the television series Batman (1966).      Attended and graduated from Montour High School in Robinson Township, PA.      Is the youngest of seven siblings. Has three brothers and three sisters.      Has one son with ex-wife Caroline McWilliams: Sean Douglas (born May 27, 1983).      Decided to change his name when he began acting because there was already a Michael Douglas in movies and a Mike Douglas in broadcasting. While he uses a stage name, he has never legally changed his name to Michael Keaton.      Was the first of only three actors to reprise the role of Batman in major, live-action films (Batman (1989)/Batman Returns (1992). Adam West did only one movie (Batman: The Movie (1966)) as Batman (along with the live-action TV series Batman (1966) and voice-work) and Kevin Conroy has only done voice-work as Batman. Christian Bale is the second actor to play the role more than once with (Batman Begins (2005) followed by The Dark Knight (2008) and for a third time in The Dark Knight Rises (2012)). Most recently, Ben Affleck has appeared in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), Suicide Squad (2016) and Justice League (2017).      Has played Agent Ray Nicolette in Jackie Brown (1997) and again in Out of Sight (1998).      Started his career as a stagehand in MisteRogers\' Neighborhood (1968) (he operated ""Picture, Picture""), and in 2004 he produced a documentary on Rogers, Fred Rogers: America\'s Favorite Neighbor (2004).      Turned down the role of the ill-fated mad scientist Dr. Seth Brundle in David Cronenberg\'s remake The Fly (1986). The role eventually went to Jeff Goldblum.      Is a Second City alumnus - a member of the Los Angeles branch.      According to Mike Myers on Revealed with Jules Asner (2001), Keaton saw him perform at Second City Toronto. After the show ended, Keaton went to personally congratulate Myers and said, ""Keep up the great work."" Myers would soon work with Keaton on an episode of Saturday Night Live (1975) when Keaton was guest host.      His son, Sean Douglas, plays keyboard for a band called ""The Hatch"".      Has appeared with the late Christopher Reeve in Speechless (1994). Keaton and Reeve played DC Comics\' two most iconic characters, Batman and Superman.      He was originally to play the role of Dr. Jack Shephard on the television series Lost (2004), with the understanding that the character would be killed off early on in the series. Keaton later had to walk away from the role when the creators decided not to kill off the doctor. Matthew Fox ended up playing the character.      Was parodied by Matthew Perry on Saturday Night Live (1975).      Was offered the role of either Peter Venkman or Egon Spengler in Ghostbusters (1984) but turned down both roles, which went to Bill Murray and Harold Ramis, respectively. Was originally slated to play Jeff Daniels character in Woody Allen\'s The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985) and actually did film some scenes, but Allen decided this was not working and replaced him with Daniels. He had the same fate in Mystic River (2003) when he was cast in the role of Sean Devine, filmed some scenes but he and director Clint Eastwood had creative differences on the project and Keaton opted to leave the film. Was considered for the role of Jack Crawford in The Silence of the Lambs (1991). Was considered for the role of Dr. Curtis McCabe in Vanilla Sky (2001). Was considered for the role of Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003). Was considered for the role of Lt. Col. Kazinski in Jarhead (2005).      An avid fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, he grew up about five miles from former Steelers coach Bill Cowher\'s hometown of Crafton, PA.      Enjoys snowboarding, golf, mountain biking, fly-fishing and riding horses on his California and Montana ranches.      One of his favorite hobbies is fly-fishing, a hobby he shares with his Night Shift (1982) co-star Henry Winkler.      Was 40 years old when filming Batman Returns (1992), which made him the oldest actor at the time to play Batman in a live-action film. He was later succeeded by Ben Affleck, who was 41 years old when cast in the role in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016).      Is the fourth--and shortest--actor to play Bruce Wayne/Batman.      His father had English, Scottish, Scots-Irish (Northern Irish), and German ancestry, while his mother was from an Irish family.      In an interview, he named Mr. Mom (1983), Gung Ho (1986), Clean and Sober (1988), Beetlejuice (1988), Batman (1989), Much Ado About Nothing (1993), The Paper (1994) and Live from Baghdad (2002) as favorite films of his own, with Beetlejuice (1988) as his top pick.      Almost reprised his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne in Tim Burton\'s unmade ""Superman Lives"", even though Val Kilmer had played the role in his place in Batman Forever (1995).      When asked in an interview which historical figure he wished he could play, his choice was Hall of Fame baseball player Ted Williams.      Is an avid news junkie and at one point had considered a career in journalism. Has played a journalist in three films: The Paper (1994), Live from Baghdad (2002) and Spotlight (2015).      Has worked with three generations of actresses: Melanie Griffith and her mother Tippi Hedren in Pacific Heights (1990), and Griffith\'s daughter Dakota Johnson in Need for Speed (2014).      As of 2016 has appeared in three films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: Toy Story 3 (2010), Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014) and Spotlight (2015). Of those, Birdman and Spotlight are winners in the category.      He was directed by Ron Howard in three films: Night Shift (1982), Gung Ho (1986) and The Paper (1994). Same goes with Tim Burton: Beetlejuice (1988), Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992).      Has appeared with Geena Davis in Beetlejuice (1988) and Speechless (1994), and had he accepted the lead role in The Fly (1986), this would be their third film (and the first they would be making together).      As of 2016 he remains as the only Bruce Wayne/Batman actor to not be directed by Terrence Malick. George Clooney appeared in The Thin Red Line (1998); Ben Affleck appeared in To the Wonder (2012); Christian Bale appeared in The New World (2005) and Knight of Cups (2015); and Val Kilmer is due to appear in Malick\'s upcoming film, which also stars Bale.      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6931 Hollywood Blvd. on July 28, 2016.      He was awarded Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters by French culture minister Fleur Pellerin on January 18, 2016.      A Democrat, he endorsed President Barack Obama for re-election in 2012 and Sen. Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination in 2016.      He was considered for the role of Harry Belafonte in When Harry Met Sally... (1989), which went to Billy Crystal.      He was considered for the role of Andrew Beckett in Philadelphia (1993), which went to Tom Hanks.      He turned down the lead role in Clean Slate (1994) in favor of My Life (1993).John McTiernan wanted him to star in The 13th Warrior (1999), but the studio did not want him.

One of them is doing quite well from what I understand, the other is making cheap porn movies--like Basic Instinct (1992).      [comparing making Batman Returns (1992) to the first Batman (1989) film] In some ways this one was harder, because I felt like I was doing an impersonation of myself. Which, aside from being nearly impossible, is really weird.      [on his decision not to reprise his role as Batman in Batman Forever (1995)] I was waiting in line for another movie and just kind of poked my head in . . . watched about 10 minutes. I saw enough to know that I made the right decision.      [When asked what he thought of Batman Begins (2005) before its release] My prediction, I don\'t know anything about it, but I feel this way about it. It\'s gonna be good, because he\'s a really good actor [Christian Bale] and that\'s a really good director [Christopher Nolan]. And they\'ve had years and years and years, and hundreds of millions of dollars, or at least tens of millions of dollars to figure it out. I say it\'s gonna be good. I picture it\'s gonna be good. And also, I swear to God it\'s not an ""I told you so"", it\'s maybe an interesting thing, that when I didn\'t like the third script . . . I just said ""I really don\'t like this, and I don\'t want to do it"", \'cause what I wanted to do, is what I\'m told and I don\'t know if this is true yet so don\'t hold me to this until I see it, but I\'m told it\'s more a prequel. And that was what I thought would\'ve been a hip way to go the third time. This guy is so endlessly fascinating potentially, why not go and see how he got there.      [when asked if he was ever offered a villain role in a superhero film] No, but it would be fun. I don\'t think I\'d take Jack\'s [Jack Nicholson] stance on it. I think it\'d be fun because those are the roles where you get to chew it up. I\'ll always stand by the first ""Batman"". Even for its imperfections, people will never know how hard that movie was to do. A lot of that still holds up.      [on filming Batman (1989) in London] It was a lonely time for me, which was great for the character, I suppose. I would run at night in London just trying to get tired enough so I could sleep. I didn\'t talk to people much. My little boy was a toddler, and the woman I was married to at the time, we were not together but we were trying to figure it out and get back together. It was me in London, alone, and my sleep during that whole movie was never right. As often as I could, I was getting on the Concorde and trying to get back to spend some time with my kid . . . It was an extremely difficult undertaking and [Tim Burton] os a shy guy, especially back then, and there was so much pressure. We were in England for a long time shooting at Pinewood and it was long, difficult nights in that dank, dark, cold place, and we never knew if it was really working. There was no guarantee that any of this was going to play correctly when it was all said and done. There had never been a movie like it before. There was a lot of risk, too, with Jack [Jack Nicholson] looking the way he did and me stepping out in this new way. The pressure was on everybody. You could feel it.      [2011, on his work ethic] I played a lot of sports when I was a kid so I get in that ballgame mindset of being really, really respectful, but at same time saying to yourself, ""Don\'t back down a single inch, hang with these guys if you can."" If they throw it high and tight you have to stand in there, you can\'t take yourself out of that moment.      [2011, on Night Shift (1982)] The character I invented was a combination of some people I knew and some things I made up, and afterward there [were other projects and offers] that would have meant trying to repeat that over and over, to be the ""glib young man"", whatever that is, but that held no interest for me. I literally thought the idea of all this, when you do it for a living, is to play a lot of different things. If you do the same thing over and over, that will eventually start to close in on you.      [2011, on Beetlejuice (1988)] From an art perspective, I don\'t know how you get better than ""Beetlejuice"". In terms of originality and a look, it\'s 100% unique. If you consider the process of taking something from someone\'s mind--meaning Tim Burton]--and putting it on the screen, I think that movie is incomparable.      [2011, on playing Beetlejuice] I wanted him to be pure electricity, that\'s why the hair just sticks out. At my house, I started creating a walk and a voice. I got some teeth. I wanted to be scary in the look and then use the voice to add a dash of goofiness that, in a way, would make it even scarier. I wanted something kind of moldy to it, too. [Tim Burton] had the striped-suit idea and we added the big eyes. I think that movie will go forever because it\'s 100% original.      [2011, on filming Batman Returns (1992)] We got to be back home [filming in Burbank] so that made me happy. It was quite the cast with Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito and everyone. It wasn\'t as satisfying to me when I saw it, but maybe that\'s because the bar was set so high on the first one. I think I only watched it one time. I knew we were in trouble in talks for the third one when certain people started the conversation with ""Why does it have to be so dark?"" ""Why does he have to be so depressed?"" ""Shouldn\'t there be more color in this thing?"" I knew I was headed for trouble and that it wasn\'t a road I was going to go down.      [2011, on Clean and Sober (1988)] The subject matter was so difficult, but oddly everyone really had fun on the shoot. One great thing about being an actor, too, is that if you have a pulse you learn something. That\'s one of the great joys and bonuses of it. You\'re forced to ask certain questions.      [2011, on Much Ado About Nothing (1993)] That\'s a movie where I said, ""I can\'t do this"" and it ended up being probably one of my top five experiences ever. I had to find a way in; I didn\'t really know what to do, quite frankly . . . In the end, [Kenneth Branagh] didn\'t get scared off by my unorthodox approach, he embraced it and was really hands-on, thankfully. It was literally like acting in another language. I had taken maybe one two-day Shakespearean class in my life, so I had no knowledge.      [2011, on filming The Paper (1994)] It\'s an awful lot of fun to be in an ensemble, especially when you\'re talking about Glenn Close, Robert Duvall and that level of actor. It was also the first time I met Duvall. People were nervous on the set when he was coming in; he\'s a presence, somebody to [reckon] with. I just loved it. I had a ball being there with him. It felt like the first time I acted with Jack Nicholson. These guys are in their very nature larger-than-life personalities, and then they\'re great actors on top of that and then they\'re iconic on top of that.      [2011, on his life as an actor] I never saw what I did for a living as who I am. But if there\'s a job in the world where that can get blurry, this is the one. The line gets really blurry for a lot of people, and for understandable reasons just as you go through life and this business. You don\'t have to be especially weak to become extremely self-involved in this business, and I just never wanted to go down that road . . . Alan Arkin said to me once that he wanted to have a really big life and a really good career. And I think that\'s really sane.      [on the backlash over his casting in Batman (1989)] When they hung me in effigy, that was, for me, harsh.      [on Michelle Pfeiffer] What impressed me about Michelle is that she\'s a California beach chick, no elevated education, but when you\'re smart you just get smarter.      [on being asked if he got jealous when other actors played Batman] No. Do you know why? Because I\'m Batman. I\'m very secure in that.

But you learn how to pace yourself, how to keep up the necessary energy level, and it\'s not quite as nerve-wracking as performing on stage because somewhere in the back of your mind you know if you make a serious mistake, they can try again.

become really bad wastes of time and money utilizing weak actors and
exploiting out-of-work celebs, but at one time they used to be funny,
hilarious and worth watching more than once. ""Airplane,"" ""Naked Gun,""
""Young Frankenstein,"" ""Blazing Saddles,"" and ""Scary Movie"" top the list
as among the best movie parodies ever made, but one movie that tends to
get forgotten is ""Johnny Dangerously."" How can anyone not love this
movie? It's a hilarious spoof of all the old gangster movies of the 30s
and 40s, and if you've never seen them, watch this instead. It has a
talented top notch cast with hilarious writing, incredible comedy and
one thing modern parodies don't have: a plot!! Michael Keaton has a
ball in this role as anything goes playing a young mobster suddenly at
the top of the New York mob and putting his kid brother through law
school, and when he makes it to city district attorney, the brother
vows to arrested Johnny Dangerously, totally unaware he's the only guy
unaware its his brother. Popular and recognizable comedy stars fill
nearly the entire cast. Marilu Henner is Johnny's girlfriend, Richard
Dimitri plays Johnny's nemesis mangling the English language every time
he talks (One line concerns he ought to be arrested for murdering the
English language.) and Griffin Dunn plays the clueless D.A., but my
favorite role has got to be Joe Piscopo. He has all the best lines, and
there are a lot of quotable references in this movie. (""You can't park
here; it's a handicapped spot!"" Â ""I am handicapped. I'm psychotic!!"" Â
Just as Joe whips out his parking placard describing him as a
psychopath.) There are both hilarious lines and visual sight gags
through this movie, and no one anywhere close to normal. Danny DeVito,
Alan Hale, Ray Walston round out the cast in this under appreciated
star-studded action comedy movie that lampoons gangsters and
Prohibition a heck of a lot funnier than ""Mafia"" ever did, and the best
part, there aren't any gay jokes, drug references or sophomoric humor
anywhere in this movie and the sexual references are so subtle, you can
actually watch the movie without rolling your eyes and being offended.

This movie is just too funny, a totally non-PC gangster romp. If Mel
Brooks
made a picture about the Mob in the 30's, it would probably look like
this.
Too many great one-liners to to remember, and while its not for everyone,
anyone who DOESNT laugh a whole bunch of times doesnt have a pulse. So,
put
it on and LAUGH you Iceholes!!!

For a movie that gets no respect there sure are a lot of memorable quotes
listed for this gem. Imagine a movie where Joe Piscopo is actually funny!
Maureen Stapleton is a scene stealer. The Moroni character is an absolute
scream. Watch for Alan ""The Skipper"" Hale jr. as a police Sgt.

Hilarious, under rated gangster spoof about an essentially good hearted
boy
who grows up to be Johnny Dangerously (Michael Keaton), AKA: John Shannon,
who uses his ill gotten gains to support his family - his ailing mom and
send his little brother to law school, of all places. Things get sticky
though when an old foe (Joe Piscapoe) comes after Johnny and his
girlfriend
(Marilu Henner) and Johnny's own brother tries to come after him as part
of
his mission to clean up the city.<br><br>Lots of great gags, like Johnny advising kids to chew gum instead of
smoking, Johnny's jail house striped suit, the running gag of Joe
Piscapoe's
character saying that certain members of his family did something to him
""once... ONCE."", the running gag of Johnny's brother being unable to
resist
the temptation of sex, and of course, the fireworks that go off whenever
Johnny gets laid.

One of the first of the gangster spoof movies this is the story of Michael
Keaton's Johnny Kelly sucked into Peter Boyle's New York gang before
eventually leading it. This is confused by the fact that Johnny's brother
(Griffin Dunne) is the DA seeking to put New York's crime lords
away.<br><br>The film is silly from start to finish - the plot doesn't make sense and the
characters are overblown, but that's the whole point - it's meant to be a
spoof and it is. The jokes are quite hit-and-miss, but the majority hit and
are funny, although you do need to be in the mood for it.<br><br>Michael Keaton is perfect in the lead role, clearly enjoying himself
immensely and is on-form for the whole movie. The whole cast provide good
support in a series of fun roles - Griffin Dunne is great as the DA, Danny
DeVito top in a small role as the crooked DA (or host of game show ""play
ball""!). Richard Dimitri is hilarious as the gangster of unknown origin,
guilty of murdering the english language (fargin' funny!), Peter Boyle is
good as Johnny's boss, but Joe Piscopo is the best support as the gangster
with attitude (""once"").<br><br>The film is a fun throwback spoof. Every element of the film is exaggerated
and the majority of it comes off well. Yes some jokes miss but they come so
thick and fast that the next one is never far away.

Michael Keaton had the job of not only portraying the fictional
gangster Johnny Dangerously, but he had to play the role by giving his
best James Cagney impression. From the Irish smile, the walk and the
way he hung his gangster type hat on his head, Keaton captured the
Rocky Sullivan character from the 1940's. Like Keaton's character, many
of the sets the movie was shot on were taken right out of movies like
Little Caesar and Public Enemy. The Club Scene is right out of Little
Caesar as well as the exterior of the hotel and the downtown newspaper
stands. The Mafia's office room is straight out of Little Caesar as
well. An amazingly funny cast including Danny DeVito, you can't beat
this comedy. A well done story with non stop comic relief with great
production value and acting.

One the whole, this movie isn't perfect. It doesn't 'hang well' together as
the story line is basically a bunch of hooks to hang jokes.<br><br>Some of these jokes are a little 'too 80s' and tend to date the
picture.<br><br>But some of these jokes are classic.<br><br>You know a movie has something special when you and your friends still
reference silly quotes from it over 2 decades later.<br><br>Plus, there are a bunch of familiar faces; Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, Joe
Piscapo, Peter Boyle, Marilu Henner, Maureen Stapleton, Bob Eubanks, Griffin
Dunne, and one of the last roles of Alan Hale Jr., the Skipper from
Gilligan's Island.<br><br>Also, there are some great absurdist moments, like when Johnny is labelling
the puppies with a pricing gun, or the Pope making an appearance in Johnny's
neighborhood. Also, the scene where the fake priest makes up a lot of words
in Latin is excellent. (""Summa cum laude, magna cum laude, the radio's too
louda... Post meridian, ante meridian, uncle meridian"").<br><br>Other Classic Scenes include
Ramone Maroney butchering the English language
Danny Devito urging Griffin Dunne to 'Play Ball'
Peter Boyle thinking he lost his manhood
The fake VD movie<br><br>This movie is no home run. But like 'Porky's', it has enough classic comedy
bits to make it memorable.

""Johnny Dangerously"" is one of those movies that exists for the sole
purpose of being silly, much like ""Airplane!"". Michael Keaton plays
Johnny Kelly, who once became a gangster under the name Johnny
Dangerously, to pay his mother's (Maureen Stapleton) bills. His nemesis
is Danny Vermin (Joe Piscopo). After a series of mix-ups, Johnny's
brother Tommy (Griffin Dunne) becomes a marked man.<br><br>That's the plot, but you don't even need to pay attention to the plot.
The whole movie is an excuse for a bunch of goofy occurrences, such as
when the year is shown in the opening scene, and a car runs over the
numbers, or when someone lights a cigarette and Johnny turns to the
camera and reminds the children in the audience never to start smoking.
My favorite character was Roman Moronie, just because of how he tried
to curse and ended up saying things like ""fargin' iceholes"". Oh, and
Alan Hale appears in one of his non-Skipper roles. In my opinion, one
of the neatest lines was, after Lil (Marilu Henner) hears Johnny's
name, she says: ""I've never met a man whose last name was an adverb.""

The jokes are obvious, the gags are corny, and the characters are walking
characatures - but I couldn't stop from laughing at his highly
entertaining
movie.  No matter how many times I see it, I still get a kick out of this
one, and I recommend it highly for all lovers of mindless entertainment.
It
contains many quotable moments, and some of the best sight-gags I've seen
to
this day.  If you've had a bad week and you need a chuckle, rent this one
on
your way home Friday night to give your weekend a good
start.

I can't remember how many times I watched it. What I do remember is
that after the first time I went to rewind it to re-watch, rather
re-enjoy, it again. And ever since, I can't get enough of it.<br><br>It's better than many of the cinematic parodies. I think it's smarter
than any parody in the first place; where the whole matter shrinks into
many gags and jokes about an available original. This time it's a movie
of its own, and its comedy comes from spoofing a whole era of making
movies, not certain ones.<br><br>This cast was unerring. For me it's Michael Keaton's comic cornerstone
and the gem of the necklace. This is Joe Piscopo best work in movies;
he can be enjoyably memorable if it's all about this role only. Marilu
Henner never looked sexier. Peter Boyle is always a star in his
supporting role. Let alone Richard Dimitri the one who played the boss
of the Indian mafia in America ! <br><br>It forced me to save its director's name : Amy Heckerling, and its
writers' as well : Harry Colomby and Jeff Harris since the first shot
with the year written on the screen to be smashed by a car after a
second ! <br><br>Speaking of which, some moments were truly exceptional. I still savor
ironies concern with cinematic stuff that used to be made in the old
days such as : the image that ripples incomprehensibly whenever there
is a flashback, the fireworks that go off whenever Johnny makes love,
the running gag about the newspapers' seller who doesn't stop having
melodramatic accidents, or the radio that gives only the news that the
drama needs! Just look at the scene in which the surprise hits all of
Johnny's gang while knowing that the DA is his brother; where the
camera gives us the consecutive reactions even the dead guy's, to know
well the wickedness of this comedy!<br><br>Recall also how the brother got the Indian mobster by a conundrum, how
the news transport Â or transform Â in jailÂetc. Simply hilarity,
special hilarity, doesn't stop in this movie. <br><br>Did you notice how all the moral speech of the lead was just a
poppycock all along since gangster Johnny is still, at the end, a
pretty much gangster not a working man in a pet shop? It's a slap in
the face of all the old moral movies, as if that preachment has no
relation to reality and the fact is crime does pay. It is the movie's
light satire and last sneer at the black and white's messages. <br><br>In maybe the fifth watching I discovered some things like : how come
Johnny's mother and brother go to cinema at the night of his
execution??, or how Johnny's bullet, that saved his brother from dying
at the movies in the nick of time, doesn't show at all in Piscopo's
body later; he was so unharmed in the next shot !!, but HEY, so was Tom
the cat in Tom &amp; Jerry's numerous movies. It is all about having a nice
time, Not thinking. However even thinking with this movie can't spoil
it. <br><br>Among me and my friends (Johnny Dangerously) is a classic of ours. It's
a small gangster comedy; so creative, amusing and totally cartoonish.
In fact it's great cartoon masquerading as live movie. It is not
gross-out, aggressive or naked comedy. Believe it or not, they used to
make these comedies ""Once"" !
