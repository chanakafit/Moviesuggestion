His mother, Mary Kathleen (McCabe), is a substitute school teacher originally from New Jersey. His father, James Donald McConaughey, was a Mississippi-born gas station owner who ran an oil pipe supply business. He is of Scottish, Irish, English, German, and Swedish descent. Matthew grew up in Longview, Texas, where he graduated from the local High School (1988). Showing little interest in his father\'s oil business, which his two brothers later joined, Matthew was longing for a change of scenery, and spent a year in Australia, washing dishes and shoveling chicken manure. Back to the States, he attended the University of Texas in Austin, originally wishing to be a lawyer. But, when he discovered an inspirational Og Mandino book ""The Greatest Salesman in the World"" before one of his final exams, he suddenly knew he had to change his major from law to film.He began his acting career in 1991, appearing in student films and commercials in Texas and directed short films as Chicano Chariots (1992). Once, in his hotel bar in Austin, he met the casting director and producer Don Phillips, who introduced him to director Richard Linklater for his next project. At first, Linklater thought Matthew was too handsome to play the role of a guy chasing high school girls in his coming-of-age drama Dazed and Confused (1993), but cast him after Matthew grew out his hair and mustache. His character was initially in three scenes but the role grew to more than 300 lines as Linklater encouraged him to do some improvisations. In 1995, he starred in The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1994), playing a mad bloodthirsty sadistic killer, opposite Renée Zellweger.Shortly thereafter, moving to L.A., Matthew became a sensation with his performances in two high-profile 1996 films Lone Star (1996), where he portrayed killing suspected sheriff and in the film adaptation of John Grisham\'s novel A Time to Kill (1996), where he played an idealistic young lawyer opposite Sandra Bullock and Kevin Spacey. The actor was soon being hailed as one of the industry\'s hottest young leading man inspiring comparisons to actor Paul Newman. His following performances were Robert Zemeckis\' Contact (1997) with Jodie Foster (the film was finished just before the death of the great astronomer and popularizer of space science Carl Sagan) and Steven Spielberg\'s Amistad (1997), a fact-based 1839 story about the rebellious African slaves. In 1998, he teamed again with Richard Linklater as one of the bank-robbing brothers in The Newton Boys (1998), set in Matthew\'s birthplace, Uvalde, Texas. During this time, he also wrote, directed and starred in the 20-minute short The Rebel (1998). In 1999, he starred in the comedy Edtv (1999), about the rise of reality television, and in 2000, he headlined Jonathan Mostow\'s U-571 (2000), portraying officer Lt. Tyler, in a WW II story of the daring mission of American submariners trying to capture the Enigma cipher machine.In the 2000s, he became known for starring in romantic comedies, such as The Wedding Planner (2001), opposite Jennifer Lopez, and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), in which he co-starred with Kate Hudson. He played Denton Van Zan, an American warrior and dragons hunter in the futuristic thriller Reign of Fire (2002), where he co-starred with Christian Bale. In 2006, he starred in the romantic comedy Failure to Launch (2006), and later as head coach Jack Lengyel in We Are Marshall (2006), along with Matthew Fox. In 2008, he played treasure hunter Benjamin ""Finn"" Finnegan in Fool\'s Gold (2008), again with Kate Hudson. After playing Connor Mead in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (2009), co-starring with Jennifer Garner, McConaughey took a two year hiatus to open different opportunities in his career. Since 2010, he has moved away from romantic comedies.That change came in 2011, in his first movie after that pause, when he portrayed criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller in The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), that operates mostly from the back seat of his Lincoln car. After this performance that was considered one of his best until then, Matthew played other iconic characters as district attorney Danny Buck Davidson in Bernie (2011), the wild private detective ""Killer"" Joe Cooper in Killer Joe (2011), Mud in Mud (2012), reporter Ward Jensen in The Paperboy (2012), male stripper club owner Dallas in Magic Mike (2012), starring Channing Tatum. McConaughey\'s career certainly reached it\'s prime, when he played HIV carrier Ron Woodroof in the biographical drama Dallas Buyers Club (2013), shot in less than a month. For his portrayal of Ron, Matthew won the Best Actor in the 86th Academy Awards, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, among other awards and nominations. The same year, he also appeared in Martin Scorsese\'s The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). In 2014, he starred in HBO\'s True Detective (2014), as detective Rustin Cohle, whose job is to investigate with his partner Martin Hart, played by Woody Harrelson, a gruesome murder that happened in his little town in Louisiana. The series was highly acclaimed by critics winning 4 of the 7 categories it was nominated at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards; he also won a Critics\' Choice Award for the role. Later in 2014, Matthew starred in Christopher Nolan\'s sci-fi film Interstellar (2014), playing Cooper, a former NASA pilot.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Tzvetislav Samardjiev, tzvetislav@abv.bg, Marcelo Gaia, and Pedro Borges          Spouse (1) Camila Alves (9 June\xa02012            - present)\xa0(3 children)          Trade Mark (4)        Curly light brown hair and soft blue eyes        Heavy Texas drawl        Habitually taking off his shirt        His catchphrase ""Alright, alright, alright!""Trivia (70)      His mother, Mary Kathleen ""Kay"" McCabe, is a schoolteacher.

I figure I am in the third round of a 15 round fight.      (on himself) My best quality is that I\'m a big hearted person. I\'m resilient, too. My worst quality is selfishness, although everyone is guilty of that to an extent. Everyone should be, I think -- you need to respect yourself.      Traveling is a great love of mine. I love South America and Africa. I\'m your ultimate backpacker when I\'m away. It\'s just me and my backpack. It\'s good for getting away from the industry.      (on how he got started in acting) I was about 21 when I started. I dropped out of law school to go to film school -- the idea of practicing law for my whole life seemed a little boring. I was doing more directing stuff to start with, until a student mate asked me to be in his film Dazed and Confused (1993). A professional guy named Don Phillips spotted me and the rest is history.      (on Hollywood) I love it. It\'s silly to say that it is a world of false and stupid people. Sure there are witches and swindlers, but you can meet there many creative, talented and generous persons too. Hollywood is a pleasant place, when you are hip to the game and you enjoy it for what it is really.      [on shapely women] I see it more with black women, who get dressed up and they\'re wearin\' everything to fit snug, and they\'re walking the walk. And you\'re like, ""Man, look at you go! Where did you get that?"". She might be a larger package, but boy, she sure understands how she\'s wrapped.      (on working with Christian Bale in Reign of Fire (2002)) Christian is one of the finest actors I\'ve ever had the privilege of working with. He\'s a giving actor, and he\'ll lay it on the line to get good results.      I want to be reincarnated as a jaguar. They\'re the coolest animals in the world. I came across one very briefly in the Manú National Park in Peru. I followed its tracks and got close enough to realize how beautifully self-contained it was. Jaguars are keen and they\'re perfectly poised. I\'d sure love to be that well designed.      To understand me, you need to understand Texan logic. If you come from Texas, you\'re 100 per cent American but you\'ll do things the Texan way. We\'re independent. We\'ve got our own way of doing things. Try to build fences round us and we\'ll run you out of town. I can go anywhere in the world but my spirit is still Texan and I recognize my own kind. There are no secret handshakes but when Texans meet there\'s a special fraternity.      I love taking advantage of my fame. If I go to the airport and get taken to the front of the line, I\'m not going to protest. When I show up to see a band and I get whisked backstage, I like it. If I\'m offered the use of a private jet, bring it on. But I draw the line at playing the, ""Do you know who I am?"" card and I refuse to have every little thing done for me. If you buy into all that, it will show up in your acting. The trick is to understand that being a good actor isn\'t playing a red-carpet celebrity. Fame is the by-product. If you don\'t see that, you\'ll be chasing your tail for a full decade ? and that makes a man dizzy. It\'s important to realize that fame is a dance, and I\'d like to think I\'ve got my dance down better now.      I\'m a loner and proud of it. I can be the world\'s most sociable guy and I love few things more than throwing a barbecue for my crowd. But being alone is where it\'s mostly at for me. Nothing beats the feeling of taking off on my own and driving to wherever the road takes me. I\'ll drive as far as I can drive, 1,700 miles in one stretch if the mood takes me. When I left Ireland after filming Reign of Fire (2002), I went backpacking on my own in Africa for 26 days. I floated on the Niger River, raced camels in the Sahara Desert, had myself a blast.      ""Just keep living"" is the motto that keeps me moving forward. I\'ve had that motto since I was 21. I was filming Dazed and Confused (1993), my father had just died, and I suddenly realized I was no longer a boy. My life\'s a lot bigger now. I have far more responsibilities. Also, it\'s been a long while since I was anonymous.      (on his favorite meal) You haven\'t lived until you\'ve tasted my butt chicken. You get a can of beer and leave half of the liquid inside it. Throw a bunch of spices into the can, then stick that in the chicken and stand it up on the grill. The beer will start to boil and the spices begin to lubricate the chicken. Do it right and nothing on this earth tastes better? no barbecue is complete without it. I cooked it up for Al Pacino while we were making Two for the Money (2005) - he dug it, man. All the proof I need.      It\'s amazing how quickly you shower when you think there might be a python in your room. There were heaps of weird creatures around in Queensland when we were shooting my latest film, Fool\'s Gold (2008). I had an 8 foot python in the coconut tree in my backyard and a 6 foot python in my shed. When I returned after three weeks, they\'d gone. It\'s one thing having pythons in your garden and knowing they\'re there; it\'s a lot more unsettling knowing they\'re somewhere about but you don\'t know where. So I was going through every closet and checking under the bed. Every time I took a bath I got nervous. I\'d be washing my hair with my eyes closed and be thinking ""What am I not seeing right now?"". With pythons about, you quickly get used to sleeping with one eye open.      Who needs a house when you can live in a trailer? People tell me it\'s not a very Hollywood way to live but it happens to be my preference. I\'ve lived in big houses and a big space gave me too many options. I had this amazing chair that I loved but I\'d go months without sitting on it. I had some nice paintings on the walls but I\'d hardly ever look at them. I realized I didn\'t need those things. So I went minimalist. My Airstream trailer is 28 feet by 7 feet and it\'s got everything I need, including TV and wireless Internet. It\'s stress-free living because my choices are limited. My living space is so small that I can sit on the toilet and scramble eggs at the same time. How cool is that?      (on working with Woody Harrelson in Edtv (1999) and Surfer, Dude (2008)) My good man Woody Harrelson, man. Whatever it is, we turn each other on. We really have a comfort with each other. Always good value with Wood-man. Classic, classic wild man.      [on playing a man who operates out of his car, in The Lincoln Lawyer (2011)] Let\'s admit it, I was that guy. I\'ve customized vans and Airstream trailers, and I know how to make a car my home.      [on doing The Lincoln Lawyer (2011)] It\'s nice to play a guy who is kind of a bottom-feeder. He\'s not about morals or ethics; he\'s about getting people off and getting it done any way he can. So he\'s pretty-street-smart, compared to my A Time to Kill (1996) guy.      (2011) I always loved to debate. I still do. I wanted to be a criminal defense lawyer at one point. And I always seem to be playing them.      (2011) I personally don\'t like to go see romantic comedies. But people do want to see them, and they seem to want to see me in them. And quite a few of them have been real successful. I like to think that they\'re not shallow--they\'re light. And it\'s hard work to keep them light, to keep the comedy buoyant. If you dig too deep in those, you kill them. In some ways, it\'s a lot easier to do something like The Lincoln Lawyer (2011). The punches hit, the bullets land and the consequences are life and death. I can click into that.      (2011, on his beginning actor days) I was waiting tables, picking up $1,500 here and there from commercials. I did a commercial for Miller Lite and made like $6,000-and that was huge!      (2011, on filming Angels in the Outfield (1994), then landing Boys on the Side (1995)) I was getting $48,500 just to act and play baseball. I thought I was rolling in dough. Two weeks into shooting that, I got called back to read for Herbert Ross and got that role (in Boys on the Side) too"".      (2011, on sudden fame after A Time to Kill (1996)) The Friday before it came out, you could have shown my picture to 100 people and asked if they knew who I was and you\'d have gotten 99 no\'s and one yes"", he says. ""And the next week, it flipped in the opposite direction. I remember walking down the street in Los Angeles the weekend the movie came out and all these people were looking at me. I remember checking my fly. There was a tremendous amount of frequency cast on me. The shift was so dramatic that, at times, it was overwhelming. Once the movie had opened, what I did to maintain my sanity was pack a backpack and get a one-way ticket to Peru. I checked out for 19 days and just hiked, anonymously, with no plan. I hiked Macchu Picchu and canoed the Amazon. I just needed to let time catch up with me.      (2011, on dealing with the paparazzi) I was tired of getting pissed off. It was legitimate but I was tired of it. I thought, well, am I ready to move to a place where they weren\'t? No, not for good. Was I ready to build fences or tall walls around my house? No. So I just shook hands with it and dealt with it. So, say I\'m taking my kids to the beach. And the photographers are there. I just talk to them and say, ""Okay, go ahead and take your picture. And then move on."" How many pictures do they need of me running on the beach? So far, they\'ve mostly respected that. But you\'ve got to have a relationship with that kind of thing if you go out in public because that check\'s already been written. Sure, I feel intruded upon. But I don\'t feel it\'s unfair. I can\'t do anything about it unless I move on or imprison myself, and I don\'t want to live like that.      [on working with teenage actors Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland in Mud (2012)] They both reminded me that seeing everything for the first time is what acting is all about. So we were playing make-believe and having fun. It\'s good that they could see the lead arrive on time and when he did he knew his lines. They were definitely watching how I handled my business.      [on playing AIDS-challenged Ron Woodroof in Dallas Buyers Club (2013)] Stay with the anarchy of this guy. Stay with the bigoted bastard. Stay with the guy who\'s out for self-preservation. Stay with the guy who\'s a business man. The guy wants to be Scarface, man - the cause, and the crusader - and the activist will be revealed. Whether you like him or not, you respect him at the end of the story because you\'re like, ""I can\'t believe someone has the courage to be that much of an ass and can still sleep at night."" This is a character who, like him or not, you\'re like, ""Well that\'s just who he is."" And if you can go ""That\'s who he is"", then you get the human. And if you\'ve got the human, he can be a bastard, a homophobe, a bigot, whatever.      [a memorable audition] Worst for me was a Lee Tamahori film. Went for a read for the part of a heavy. I knew going out, \'Man, you kind of gave 80 percent\'. So I got in my truck and turned around - U-turn - came back in, walked right past the secretary, knocked the casting director out of the way, went right up to Tamahori and weight-nailed him against the wall. I grabbed the next guy and put him in the corner, grabbed like a spoon or something. I just wrecked the room and then left. I didn\'t hear back from \'em.      I didn\'t study acting before I got my first job. And I thought, ""Hey, maybe you\'re not the kind of actor that needs to study lines - you just know your man, and you show up and you just do it\'. I go do this film Scorpion Spring (1995), and I get this idea. ""I\'m not gonna look at anything. I know what I am - the drug lord on the Mexican border in Texas. I\'ll just show up on the set, stay fresh and loose."" Well I get down there and I pick this scene, and it\'s a page-and-a-half monologue in Spanish. I felt this trickle of sweat. ""Um, can you give me twelve minutes?"". And I said, ""Never again, man."".      [on Dallas Buyers Club (2013)] I really enjoyed working with Jean-Marc [Vallee]. He introduced me to Skype; I didn\'t know what Skype was. He didn\'t like the emails as much as talking in person, so we had many late nights sitting there discussing the script. We took a hell of a ride together.      [on the reaction to his dieting, losing 47 pounds for his role in Dallas Buyers Club (2013)] My daughter was looking at me, and she said, ""Why is your neck long like a giraffe?"". The giraffe\'s neck was the only comment I got from them. They saw the transformation day to day. Now when I went to see someone who I hadn\'t seen in months, that\'s the people who would go crazy. It went from ""Is everything alright?"" and then it got to ""Are you okay?"" and the last one was, ""Oh my God, you\'re sick."" At that point, I thought Ron was just the weight he needed to be.      [on being cast opposite Woody Harrelson] Part of why we\'re friends and part of why we do what we do the way we do is that we\'re on each other\'s frequency. We add on, we affirm each other, and we one-up each other. It can turn into improv and it can go and go into the ether and then some.      [on his catchphrase] Those were actually the very first words I ever said on screen (in Dazed and Confused (1993)). ""Alright, alright, alright."" And do you know why I said \'alright\' three times? I\'m going to give you a callback to something I said five minutes ago. Because I\'m in my car, I\'m high, I\'ve got my rock \'n\' roll, but I don\'t have the chick. So I got three out of four that matter to me. So it\'s just alright, alright, alright! There\'s no fourth \'alright\'. I gotta pull into the top notch and pick up the fourth.

My wife and I launched immediately into a conversation about this film
before the end credits had even finished rolling. It's the kind of film that
makes you want to apply some of its ideas and themes to your own life and
experiences.<br><br>At first I was worried. When the film began, I thought it was going to be an
episodic experimental piece, with 13 different scenes each dealing with an
aspect of happiness. This bothered me, because the first segment of the film
left me wanting more of the same story and I would have been disappointed if
the screenplay had never come back to it. However, the first few segments
that seem at first to be unrelated begin to mesh in a fluid way (but never
in a way that feels forced), and what happens in one begins to illuminate
the actions and feelings in another.<br><br>Because of it's episodic nature, the actors don't get a lot of room to flesh
out their characters, but the performances are still strong. Alan Arkin is

In `13 Conversations About One Thing,' the `one thing' that everyone keeps
having conversations about is whether or not happiness is possible in a
world that seems to be made up of little more than a series of random events
haphazardly strung together.  Just as everything seems to be going your way,
an unexpected and unforeseen `event' may knock you completely off course,
thereby depriving you of that `happiness' you felt, moments before, lay just
within your grasp.  This view of life seems to be rather popular among
filmmakers this year, having also been explored in some depth in the sci-fi
thriller `Signs' this summer.  `13 Conversations' takes a more low-keyed
approach, providing a series of interlocking vignettes from everyday life
that, when pieced together, provide a possible answer to life's ultimate
question.  <br><br>Writers Karen and Jill Sprecher (the latter also directed the film) have
fashioned a complex narrative involving a number of characters whose paths
cross in bizarre and often shocking ways.  In fact, the film is rather
unique in that the structure actually BECOMES the theme, as we discover that
events that seem random to us - and indeed to the characters - at the outset
actually come together to form a meaningful pattern.  As one character says
at the end of the film, life really only makes sense when we take the time
to look back on it, for it is only from that perspective that we are able to
discern the overarching pattern and meaning of it all.<br><br>All of the many characters in the film are struggling not only to define
happiness but to attain a measure of it for themselves in a world in which
they are made to feel like mere helpless pawns, blown about by the whims of
`fortune,' `luck,' `chance,' `fate,' whatever one wants to call the `power'
that seems to determine the courses our lives end up taking.    Matthew
McConaughey plays a handsome and successful public defender who feels that
he has achieved happiness in his career only to have it ripped from him when
he runs over a young woman at a corner and leaves the scene of the crime. 
The woman herself (Clea Duvall), before the accident, is a sincere believer
in a higher power that watches over us and guides us along the path it most
wants us to take.  Yet, after the accident, she loses that belief, coming
instead to see life as a chaotic jumble of chance circumstances, devoid of
meaning and purpose.  John Turturro plays a college professor suffering from
the classic symptoms of major midlife crisis.  He abandons his wife (Amy
Irving), conducts a meaningless affair with a coworker, and finds no
relevance or fulfillment in his teaching job or in the students he could be
guiding and helping.  As a Physics teacher, he knows that the universe is
NOT random, that it does, in fact, operate within a series of finely
proscribed natural laws.  Perhaps this is why he is the one character who
actually tries to buck `fate' and to take proactive measures to change the
course of his life.  The problem is that the course change brings him no
more satisfaction than did his previous life path.  Perhaps, most
fascinating of all is Alan Arkin, a businessman so unhappy with his own life
that he takes pleasure in ruining the life of a co-worker who seems somehow
to have attained the happiness that has eluded the rest of
us.<br><br>`13 Conversations About One Thing' is definitely a movie that grows on you. 
Like `Go' a few years back, the makers of this film respect the intelligence
of their audience.  They gather the strands of their story slowly, thereby
allowing us to make connections and to eventually come up with the theme on
our own.  As the film's director, Jill Sprecher never hurries us along.  In
fact, much of the profundity of the screenplay is brought out by the
elegiac, lyrical tone she establishes throughout.  The quiet, unhurried
pacing of the scenes puts the audience into a reflective state of mind that
helps us see beneath the deceptively simple surface of the film's
action.<br><br>McConaughey, Duvall, Turturro and Irving are all outstanding in this film,
but it is Arkin who soars in the key role of the disgruntled businessman. 
His sad-faced, understated portrayal of a man so caught up in petty
bitterness that he will willfully destroy a harmless fellow human being to
make himself feel a bit less miserable is shattering in its brilliance.  He
has truly never been better.   Ditto for the other actors, for this is a
great ensemble cast, even though most of the performers never appear in any
scenes together.<br><br>`13 Conversations About One Thing' is a film that feels like it has REALLY
BEEN THOUGHT OUT ahead of time, not thrown together in haphazard fashion as
so many other films appear to be.  And that, given the theme of the film, is
exactly the point.<br><br>

13 Conversations is amazing.  I don't say this lightly, but I would count
it, perhaps, as one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Concise,
thoughtful, smart, perfectly woven.  I have watched it a few times, and
each
time, it inspired me and made me think.  The dialogue was economic; the
shooting exact.  The music was brilliant.  Casting was terrific, and
acting,
excellent.  The DP and gaffing work were masterful, as the film's colors
were so clean and fresh, it made you think it wasn't New York City, but
rather, any city -- allowing the story to breathe and blossom.  That is a
real achievement for a film set in NYC.  In short, everything in the film
was just as it should be -- fitting its own story perfectly, representing
its thoughts, its characters, its themes with seemingly effortless grace
and
poetry.  I am amazed that the Sprecher sisters aren't major household
names
with six picture studio deals -- they are talented filmmakers with a
unique,
creative voice.  (It is frustrating today that the lowest common
denominator
of blockbuster fare seem often to be given more money and coverage than
filmmakers like the Sprechers who make true gems.)  13 Conversations is
intelligent, moving, and beautiful.  Definitely a film to make sure to
see.

It's rare that a film by an independent filmmaker can pack such a lot
in the way of human interaction. Jill Sprecher, inspired by a mugging
she suffered, co-wrote the story in which her movie is based, with her
sister Karen. Ms. Sprecher shows an insight that is rare in the young
directors starting in the business today.<br><br>If you haven't watched the film please stop reading.<br><br>The basic idea for the movie seems to be how interconnected we human
beings are. This premise is expanded as we watch how all of the
characters we see in the film, in one way, or another, share a moment
in their existence where they touch each other's lives without even
being aware of the fact. Ms. Sprecher weaves a fine web, as she shows
the different situations in the movie.<br><br>Troy, the self-centered lawyer touches Gene's life when both are
drinking, for different reasons, at the same bar. Gene is older and
wiser; at the time they meet Gene is feeling sorry for himself, having
being ""downsized"" from his job. Troy, being in high spirits, after
having won a case in court, looks down to Gene, a man who he perceives
as a loser. Troy's own life will go through it's own turmoil after the
involuntary accident where he injures a young woman in a deserted
street. Instead of helping her, he flees the scene, leaving the girl to
what could be a sure death.<br><br>Gene is the center of the story in many ways. We see him as the man in
charge of an insurance claims department. There is a man who works for
Gene that is the epitome of good naturedness, a real kind person who is
always bringing things for everyone in the office. When Gene is asked
to reduce costs in his area, he fires Bowman, the man, who according to
logic, must be let go first, being the last one hired. We wonder for a
moment if this is just a way for Gene to get back at Bowman, because it
appears this man irritates him and his coworkers. Bowman, who up to
that moment has been so optimistic about things, immediately becomes a
sad man.<br><br>Walker, the university professor is unhappily married to Patricia. We
watch both as their marriage comes to an end. Walker is carrying on an
affair with another woman from work; he ends up living alone in a small
room. Not only does he lose his wife, but Helen too, the woman he was
having the affair with. His life and Troy's meet, if only briefly when
he buys the lawyer's car. Walker is in a way responsible for the death
of one of his students who is not doing well in the Physics course.<br><br>Then there is Bea, the young woman who cleans rich people's houses.
Together with Dorrie, she fantasizes what it would be like to live in
one of those fabulous places. Bea, who almost died when she was a
child, is not bitter about her experience. She is a kind soul who is
good to everybody, no matter who. Her life and Troy's become entwined
in a second without realizing, or knowing him, as his car hits her in
the desolate street where she is walking to the house of one of her
employers to return the shirt she has just finished resewing for him.
After going to her mother's home from the hospital, we see a gradual
transformation in Bea. She's still a kind person, but now she has a
different attitude toward life and the bad hand she was dealt.<br><br>This film brought to mind Arthur Schnitzler's play ""La Ronde"" since the
idea is basically the same. We humans tend to overlook the relation we
have with one another, and how, in some ways, we touch the life of
other people, the same way they touch ours. <br><br>The acting is first rate. Ms. Sprecher ought to be congratulated in the
way she is able to present her story and get outstanding acting by all
the principals and even those in small roles. Alan Arkin, as Gene, is
amazing. We see in his face how everything is affecting him at all
times. John Turturro gives a complex reading of this university
professor. Clea DuVall brings such a luminous aura to Bea, that it's
impossible not to feel bad for what has been done to her; she gives a
subtle performance. Matthew McConaughey's depiction of Troy is good.<br><br>There are a lot of minor roles by actors of the stature of Shawn
Elliott, Frankie Faison, Tia Texada, Rob McElhenney, Barbara Sukowa,
and William Wise, who is perfect as Bowman.<br><br>Congratulations are in order to Jill Sprecher who shows a talent for
directing real people in real situations. Judging by this effort, she
has the potential of going far.

What a great film. The ties between these disparate stories are wondrously
woven, and the sudden eye-opening twists are amazing. The spare music is a
perfect backdrop. The acting is marvelous, with Amy Irving as the neglected
wife of the melancholy professor  and Alan Arkin playing the driven and
lugubrious businessman with lots of problems and. I hardly realized who it
was until halfway through the movie. I would compare this movie to other
great art movies such as My Dinner With Andre, My Brilliant Career, Days of
Heaven. It evoked in me similar emotions. If you are feeling down and want a
big lift, I highly recommend this wonderful film. It deserves an 8 out of
10.

It must be quite something to know about screen writing and sit down to
a blank sheet of paper. You can start with images, or characters or
situations. You have to choose the type of thread and how you trace it,
including the key decision about who you are. These sisters take a
different approach, very writerly, very clever. They start with the
simple question of happiness in a life and come at it from multiple
directions, surrounding and probing it. The characters are secondary to
the writer's curiosity, and the 'stories' even more incidental.
Sometimes you have a film that works with the viewer to grow a world
and ideas; here you simply watch as ideas grown on a page are revealed
to you. Quite different, precious, but never close to lifealtering or
even viscerally engaging.<br><br>The film itself superficially resembles a 'Short Cuts' or 'Things You
Can Tell' in that many story lines are interwoven. But the differences
are profound. Altman's projects are driven by characters and situations
that touch because they ramble. The 'Things You Can Tell' project is
similar to this one in that its several components are all about the
same idea. But 'Things' uses the device of one woman in many bodies,
each with a different actress. In this project, the device is
deliberate diversity of the characters, each facet having a discernible
face.<br><br>I liked it. Its not highly cinematic, rather small theater. Its not the
stuff that changes one's imagination. But it is literate, refined, and
well woven in terms of the words.<br><br>As to the actors and their roles, one thing all these multifaceted
projects have is the option for the viewer to select a backbone. As a
matter of hardwiring we reflexively choose one thread as foreground and
the others as background. For me, the anchor was Beatrice, which
probably tells you a lot about me. The resurrection from
disillusionment (with the opening of the doll's eye!) was a bit heavy
so far as the character, but DuVall as an actor really impressed me.
All of these actors played characters with an unrecognized inner life.
Some, like Turturro work with more self-referential techniques, but
with her it seemed true.<br><br>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.

The structure of this film is familiar as we see different stories with
characters that in some sort of way are connected to one another. The
structure is reminiscent of a John Sayles film but this is top notch writing
and character development. Directed by Jill Sprecher who also wrote the
script with her sister Karen and has a number of very good actors who help
raise the level of the material. The film seems to be about characters who
make decisions then have to live with the consequences of their actions.
Matthew McConaughey is a lawyer who after winning a big case and celebrating
hits a woman (Clea DuVall) with his car and leaves the scene of the crime.
John Turturro is a teacher who decides to have an affair. Alan Arkin gives
the strongest performance in the film, which is no surprise. He works in an
insurance office and must let someone go and decides it will be a man who is
always happy. This has always irritated Arkins character. He simply cannot
understand how anyone could be happy all the time. Later, he feels guilty
about his actions and tries to get him another job at another company.
Sprecher does a good job of keeping the script simple without going over the
top to satisfy a more shallow audience. This is a film that gets more
interesting when viewed on more than one occasion. Definitely a film that
can be discussed at great lengths considering the realistic and flawed
nature of each character.

Imagine! A movie with no car chase, no special effects, no big stars,
simple
piano music, and no special sets. Just ordinary people struggling with
daily
life and trying to find the secret of happiness. Four basic stories
interweave with each other, all examining the same human issues. Alan
Arkin
practically walks away with all the acting honors, but there are no weak
roles or acting. What a joy to watch a profound movie, simply

This is most definitely not my first choice of genres, but still I thought

pretty much just a movie about a bunch of people and the things that happen

The lawyer Troy (Matthew McConaughey), the actuary Gene (Alan Arkin), the
physical science professor Walker (John Turturro) and the housecleaner
Beatrice (Clea DuVall) have their lives connected through some sort of
event. Troy meets Gene in a bar, hits Beatrice on the street and due to the
accident, decides to sell his car to Walker. Through this non-chronological
connection line, the viewer participates of their personal dramas, all of
them relative to happiness and how unpredictable life is. In a moment, each
character has a moment of happiness or expectation of a good event in his
life, which is changed later due to some unexpected occurrence. The question
is `Can we be happy in a world where our destiny is governed by
uncertainties?' This movie is a very bitter and profound story about
happiness and unpredictability of life. I saw this movie yesterday on cable
television and my vote in IMDB User Rating was seven. However, I intend to
see this film again (maybe on DVD) and reevaluate my review. I was not aware
of the theme of this complex and almost unpleasant story and maybe my first
impression was unfair. The direction and the performance of the cast are

course of his life.  The problem is that the course change brings him no
more satisfaction than did his previous life path.  Perhaps, most
fascinating of all is Alan Arkin, a businessman so unhappy with his own life
that he takes pleasure in ruining the life of a co-worker who seems somehow
to have attained the happiness that has eluded the rest of
us.<br><br>`13 Conversations About One Thing' is definitely a movie that grows on you. 
Like `Go' a few years back, the makers of this film respect the intelligence
of their audience.  They gather the strands of their story slowly, thereby
allowing us to make connections and to eventually come up with the theme on
our own.  As the film's director, Jill Sprecher never hurries us along.  In
fact, much of the profundity of the screenplay is brought out by the
elegiac, lyrical tone she establishes throughout.  The quiet, unhurried
pacing of the scenes puts the audience into a reflective state of mind that
helps us see beneath the deceptively simple surface of the film's
action.<br><br>McConaughey, Duvall, Turturro and Irving are all outstanding in this film,
but it is Arkin who soars in the key role of the disgruntled businessman. 
His sad-faced, understated portrayal of a man so caught up in petty
bitterness that he will willfully destroy a harmless fellow human being to
make himself feel a bit less miserable is shattering in its brilliance.  He
has truly never been better.   Ditto for the other actors, for this is a
great ensemble cast, even though most of the performers never appear in any
scenes together.<br><br>`13 Conversations About One Thing' is a film that feels like it has REALLY
BEEN THOUGHT OUT ahead of time, not thrown together in haphazard fashion as
so many other films appear to be.  And that, given the theme of the film, is
exactly the point.<br><br>

13 Conversations is amazing.  I don't say this lightly, but I would count
it, perhaps, as one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Concise,
thoughtful, smart, perfectly woven.  I have watched it a few times, and
each
time, it inspired me and made me think.  The dialogue was economic; the
shooting exact.  The music was brilliant.  Casting was terrific, and
acting,
excellent.  The DP and gaffing work were masterful, as the film's colors
were so clean and fresh, it made you think it wasn't New York City, but
rather, any city -- allowing the story to breathe and blossom.  That is a
real achievement for a film set in NYC.  In short, everything in the film
was just as it should be -- fitting its own story perfectly, representing
its thoughts, its characters, its themes with seemingly effortless grace
and
poetry.  I am amazed that the Sprecher sisters aren't major household
names
with six picture studio deals -- they are talented filmmakers with a
unique,
creative voice.  (It is frustrating today that the lowest common
denominator
of blockbuster fare seem often to be given more money and coverage than
filmmakers like the Sprechers who make true gems.)  13 Conversations is
intelligent, moving, and beautiful.  Definitely a film to make sure to
see.

It's rare that a film by an independent filmmaker can pack such a lot
in the way of human interaction. Jill Sprecher, inspired by a mugging
she suffered, co-wrote the story in which her movie is based, with her
sister Karen. Ms. Sprecher shows an insight that is rare in the young
directors starting in the business today.<br><br>If you haven't watched the film please stop reading.<br><br>The basic idea for the movie seems to be how interconnected we human
beings are. This premise is expanded as we watch how all of the
characters we see in the film, in one way, or another, share a moment
in their existence where they touch each other's lives without even
being aware of the fact. Ms. Sprecher weaves a fine web, as she shows
the different situations in the movie.<br><br>Troy, the self-centered lawyer touches Gene's life when both are
drinking, for different reasons, at the same bar. Gene is older and
wiser; at the time they meet Gene is feeling sorry for himself, having
being ""downsized"" from his job. Troy, being in high spirits, after
having won a case in court, looks down to Gene, a man who he perceives
as a loser. Troy's own life will go through it's own turmoil after the
involuntary accident where he injures a young woman in a deserted
street. Instead of helping her, he flees the scene, leaving the girl to
what could be a sure death.<br><br>Gene is the center of the story in many ways. We see him as the man in
charge of an insurance claims department. There is a man who works for
Gene that is the epitome of good naturedness, a real kind person who is
always bringing things for everyone in the office. When Gene is asked
to reduce costs in his area, he fires Bowman, the man, who according to
logic, must be let go first, being the last one hired. We wonder for a
moment if this is just a way for Gene to get back at Bowman, because it
appears this man irritates him and his coworkers. Bowman, who up to
that moment has been so optimistic about things, immediately becomes a
sad man.<br><br>Walker, the university professor is unhappily married to Patricia. We
watch both as their marriage comes to an end. Walker is carrying on an
affair with another woman from work; he ends up living alone in a small
room. Not only does he lose his wife, but Helen too, the woman he was
having the affair with. His life and Troy's meet, if only briefly when
he buys the lawyer's car. Walker is in a way responsible for the death
of one of his students who is not doing well in the Physics course.<br><br>Then there is Bea, the young woman who cleans rich people's houses.
Together with Dorrie, she fantasizes what it would be like to live in
one of those fabulous places. Bea, who almost died when she was a
child, is not bitter about her experience. She is a kind soul who is
good to everybody, no matter who. Her life and Troy's become entwined
in a second without realizing, or knowing him, as his car hits her in
the desolate street where she is walking to the house of one of her
employers to return the shirt she has just finished resewing for him.
After going to her mother's home from the hospital, we see a gradual
transformation in Bea. She's still a kind person, but now she has a
different attitude toward life and the bad hand she was dealt.<br><br>This film brought to mind Arthur Schnitzler's play ""La Ronde"" since the
idea is basically the same. We humans tend to overlook the relation we
have with one another, and how, in some ways, we touch the life of
other people, the same way they touch ours. <br><br>The acting is first rate. Ms. Sprecher ought to be congratulated in the
way she is able to present her story and get outstanding acting by all
the principals and even those in small roles. Alan Arkin, as Gene, is
amazing. We see in his face how everything is affecting him at all
times. John Turturro gives a complex reading of this university
professor. Clea DuVall brings such a luminous aura to Bea, that it's
impossible not to feel bad for what has been done to her; she gives a
subtle performance. Matthew McConaughey's depiction of Troy is good.<br><br>There are a lot of minor roles by actors of the stature of Shawn
Elliott, Frankie Faison, Tia Texada, Rob McElhenney, Barbara Sukowa,
and William Wise, who is perfect as Bowman.<br><br>Congratulations are in order to Jill Sprecher who shows a talent for
directing real people in real situations. Judging by this effort, she
has the potential of going far.

What a great film. The ties between these disparate stories are wondrously
woven, and the sudden eye-opening twists are amazing. The spare music is a
perfect backdrop. The acting is marvelous, with Amy Irving as the neglected
wife of the melancholy professor  and Alan Arkin playing the driven and
lugubrious businessman with lots of problems and. I hardly realized who it
was until halfway through the movie. I would compare this movie to other
great art movies such as My Dinner With Andre, My Brilliant Career, Days of
Heaven. It evoked in me similar emotions. If you are feeling down and want a
big lift, I highly recommend this wonderful film. It deserves an 8 out of
10.

It must be quite something to know about screen writing and sit down to
a blank sheet of paper. You can start with images, or characters or
situations. You have to choose the type of thread and how you trace it,
including the key decision about who you are. These sisters take a
different approach, very writerly, very clever. They start with the
simple question of happiness in a life and come at it from multiple
directions, surrounding and probing it. The characters are secondary to
the writer's curiosity, and the 'stories' even more incidental.
Sometimes you have a film that works with the viewer to grow a world
and ideas; here you simply watch as ideas grown on a page are revealed
to you. Quite different, precious, but never close to lifealtering or
even viscerally engaging.<br><br>The film itself superficially resembles a 'Short Cuts' or 'Things You
Can Tell' in that many story lines are interwoven. But the differences
are profound. Altman's projects are driven by characters and situations
that touch because they ramble. The 'Things You Can Tell' project is
similar to this one in that its several components are all about the
same idea. But 'Things' uses the device of one woman in many bodies,
each with a different actress. In this project, the device is
deliberate diversity of the characters, each facet having a discernible
face.<br><br>I liked it. Its not highly cinematic, rather small theater. Its not the
stuff that changes one's imagination. But it is literate, refined, and
well woven in terms of the words.<br><br>As to the actors and their roles, one thing all these multifaceted
projects have is the option for the viewer to select a backbone. As a
matter of hardwiring we reflexively choose one thread as foreground and
the others as background. For me, the anchor was Beatrice, which
probably tells you a lot about me. The resurrection from
disillusionment (with the opening of the doll's eye!) was a bit heavy
so far as the character, but DuVall as an actor really impressed me.
All of these actors played characters with an unrecognized inner life.
Some, like Turturro work with more self-referential techniques, but
with her it seemed true.<br><br>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.

The structure of this film is familiar as we see different stories with
characters that in some sort of way are connected to one another. The
structure is reminiscent of a John Sayles film but this is top notch writing
and character development. Directed by Jill Sprecher who also wrote the
script with her sister Karen and has a number of very good actors who help
raise the level of the material. The film seems to be about characters who
make decisions then have to live with the consequences of their actions.
Matthew McConaughey is a lawyer who after winning a big case and celebrating
hits a woman (Clea DuVall) with his car and leaves the scene of the crime.
John Turturro is a teacher who decides to have an affair. Alan Arkin gives
the strongest performance in the film, which is no surprise. He works in an
insurance office and must let someone go and decides it will be a man who is
always happy. This has always irritated Arkins character. He simply cannot
understand how anyone could be happy all the time. Later, he feels guilty
about his actions and tries to get him another job at another company.
Sprecher does a good job of keeping the script simple without going over the
top to satisfy a more shallow audience. This is a film that gets more
interesting when viewed on more than one occasion. Definitely a film that
can be discussed at great lengths considering the realistic and flawed
nature of each character.

Imagine! A movie with no car chase, no special effects, no big stars,
simple
piano music, and no special sets. Just ordinary people struggling with
daily
life and trying to find the secret of happiness. Four basic stories
interweave with each other, all examining the same human issues. Alan
Arkin
practically walks away with all the acting honors, but there are no weak
roles or acting. What a joy to watch a profound movie, simply
made.

This is most definitely not my first choice of genres, but still I thought
this film was pretty good.  The film is a little slow, but it's quite
interesting in the end.  The characters in the film are really quite
interesting and even at the end of the film I wanted to know what else
happened to the characters.<br><br>The acting was good on all accounts, Matthew McConaughey, John Tuturro, Clea
DuVall and Alan Arkin all did a fantastic jobs and I really liked all of
their characters quite a bit.<br><br>Even though, I liked the film I wouldn't recommend this to everyone.  It's
pretty much just a movie about a bunch of people and the things that happen
in their lives.  I kind of found the movie to be a lot like ""Playing By
Heart"", so if you liked that film, you may like this film.  I hope you enjoy
the film.  Thanks for reading,<br><br>-Chris

The lawyer Troy (Matthew McConaughey), the actuary Gene (Alan Arkin), the
physical science professor Walker (John Turturro) and the housecleaner
Beatrice (Clea DuVall) have their lives connected through some sort of
event. Troy meets Gene in a bar, hits Beatrice on the street and due to the
accident, decides to sell his car to Walker. Through this non-chronological
connection line, the viewer participates of their personal dramas, all of
them relative to happiness and how unpredictable life is. In a moment, each
character has a moment of happiness or expectation of a good event in his
life, which is changed later due to some unexpected occurrence. The question
is `Can we be happy in a world where our destiny is governed by
uncertainties?' This movie is a very bitter and profound story about
happiness and unpredictability of life. I saw this movie yesterday on cable
television and my vote in IMDB User Rating was seven. However, I intend to
see this film again (maybe on DVD) and reevaluate my review. I was not aware
of the theme of this complex and almost unpleasant story and maybe my first
impression was unfair. The direction and the performance of the cast are
outstanding, highlighting the acting of the (always) excellent Alan
Arkin.<br><br>Title (Brazil): `Treze Visões' (`Thirteen Visions')

Her mother Gladys Pearl Baker was a film-cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. Marilyn\'s father\'s identity was never known. Because Gladys was mentally and financially unable to care for young Marilyn, Gladys placed her in the care of a foster family, The Bolenders. Although the Bolender family wanted to adopt Marilyn, Gladys was eventually able to stabilize her lifestyle and took Marilyn back in her care when Marilyn was 7 years old. However, shortly after regaining custody of Marilyn, Gladys had a complete mental breakdown and was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and was committed to a state mental hospital. Gladys spent the rest of her life going in and out of hospitals and did not have contact with Marilyn ever again. Gladys outlived her daughter, dying in 1984.Marilyn was then taken in by Gladys\' best friend Grace Goddard, who, after a series of foster homes, placed Marilyn into the Los Angeles Orphan\'s Home in 1935. Marilyn was traumatized by her experience there despite the Orphan\'s Home being an adequate living facility. Grace Goddard eventually took Marilyn back to live with her in 1937 although this stay did not last long as Grace\'s husband began molesting Marilyn. Marilyn went to live with Grace\'s Aunt Ana after this incident, although due to Aunt Ana\'s advanced age she could not care properly for Marilyn. Marilyn once again for the third time had to return to live with the Goddard\'s. The Goddard\'s planned to relocated and according to law, could not take Marilyn with them. She only had two choices: return to the orphanage or get married. Marilyn was only 16 years old.She decided to marry a neighborhood friend named James Dougherty; he went into the military, she modeled, they divorced in 1946. She owned 200 books (including Tolstoy, Whitman, Milton), listened to Beethoven records, studied acting at the Actors\' lab in Hollywood, and took literature courses at UCLA downtown. 20th Century Fox gave her a contract but let it lapse a year later. In 1948, Columbia gave her a six-month contract, turned her over to coach Natasha Lytess and featured her in the B movie Ladies of the Chorus (1948) in which she sang three numbers : ""Every Baby Needs a Da Da Daddy"", ""Anyone Can Tell I Love You"" and ""The Ladies of the Chorus"" with Adele Jergens (dubbed by Virginia Rees) and others. Joseph L. Mankiewicz saw her in a small part in The Asphalt Jungle (1950) and put her in All About Eve (1950), resulting in 20th Century re-signing her to a seven-year contract. Niagara (1953) and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) launched her as a sex symbol superstar.When she went to a supper honoring her in the The Seven Year Itch (1955), she arrived in a red chiffon gown borrowed from the studio (she had never owned a gown). That same year, she married and divorced baseball great Joe DiMaggio (their wedding night was spent in Paso Robles, California). After The Seven Year Itch (1955), she wanted serious acting to replace the sexpot image and went to New York\'s Actors Studio. She worked with director Lee Strasberg and also underwent psychoanalysis to learn more about herself. Critics praised her transformation in Bus Stop (1956) and the press was stunned by her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller. True to form, she had no veil to match her beige wedding dress so she dyed one in coffee; he wore one of the two suits he owned. They went to England that fall where she made The Prince and the Showgirl (1957) with Laurence Olivier, fighting with him and falling further prey to alcohol and pills. Two miscarriages and gynecological surgery followed. So did an affair with Yves Montand. Work on her last picture The Misfits (1961), written for her by departing husband Miller was interrupted by exhaustion. She was dropped from the unfinished Something\'s Got to Give (1962) due to chronic lateness and drug dependency.On August 4, 1962, Marilyn Monroe\'s day began with threatening phone calls. Dr. Ralph Greenson, Marilyn\'s physician, came over the following day and quoted later in a document ""felt it was possible that Marilyn Monroe had felt rejected by some of the people she had been close to"". Apart from being upset that her publicist slept too long, she seemed fine. Pat Newcombe, who had stayed the previous night at Marilyn\'s house, left in the early evening as did Greenson who had a dinner date. Marilyn was upset he couldn\'t stay, and around 7:30pm she telephoned him while she was to tell him that her second husband\'s son had called him. Peter Lawford also called Marilyn, inviting her to dinner, but she declined. Lawford later said her speech was slurred. As the dark and depressing evening for Marilyn wore on there were other phone calls, including one from Jose Belanos, who said he thought she sounded fine. According to the funeral directors, Marilyn died sometime between 9:30pm and 11:30pm. Her maid unable to raise her but seeing a light under her locked door, called the police shortly after midnight. She also phoned Ralph Greenson who, on arrival, could not break down the bedroom door. He eventually broke in through French windows and found Marilyn dead in bed. The coroner stated she had died from acute barbiturate poisoning, and it was a \'probable suicide\'.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Ed Stephan <stephan@cc.wwu.edu>                    Probably the most celebrated of all actresses, Marilyn Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson on June 1, 1926, in the charity ward of the Los Angeles General Hospital. Prior to her birth, Marilyn\'s father bought a motorcycle and headed north to San Francisco, abandoning the family in Los Angeles. Marilyn grew up not knowing for sure who her father really was. Her mother, Gladys, had entered into several relationships, further confusing her daughter as to who it was who fathered her. Afterward, Gladys gave Norma Jeane (Marilyn) the name of Baker, a boyfriend she had before Mortenson. Poverty was a constant companion to Gladys and Norma. Gladys, who was extremely attractive and worked for RKO Studios as a filmcutter, suffered from mental illness and was in and out of mental institutions for the rest of her life, and because of that Norma Jeane spent time in foster homes. When she was nine, she was placed in an orphanage where she was to stay for the next two years. Upon being released from the orphanage, she went to yet another foster home. In 1942, at age 16, Norma Jeane married 21-year-old aircraft plant worker James Dougherty. The marriage only lasted four years, and they divorced in 1946. By this time, Marilyn began to model swimsuits and bleached her hair blonde. Various shots made their way into the public eye, where some were eventually seen by RKO Pictures head Howard Hughes. He offered Marilyn a screen test, but an agent suggested that 20th Century-Fox would be the better choice for her, since it was a much bigger and more prestigious studio. She was signed to a contract at $125 per week for a six-month period and that was increased by $25 per week at the end of that time when her contract was lengthened.Her first film was in 1947 with a bit part in The Shocking Miss Pilgrim (1947). Her next production was not much better, a bit in the eminently forgettable Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay! (1948). Two of the three brief scenes in which she appeared wound up on the cutting room floor. Later that same year, she was given a somewhat better role as Evie in Dangerous Years (1947). However, Fox declined to renew her contract, so she went back to modeling and acting school.Columbia Pictures then picked her up to play Peggy Martin in Ladies of the Chorus (1948), where she sang two numbers. Notices from the critics were favorable for her, if not the film, but Columbia dropped her. Once again Marilyn returned to modeling. In 1949, she appeared in United Artists\' Love Happy (1949). It was also that same year she posed nude for the now famous calendar shot which was later to appear in Playboy magazine in 1953 and further boost her career. She would be the first centerfold in that magazine\'s long and illustrious history. The next year proved to be a good year for Marilyn. She appeared in five films, but the good news was that she received very good notices for her roles in two of them, The Asphalt Jungle (1950) from MGM and All About Eve (1950) from Fox. Even though both roles were basically not much more than bit parts, movie fans remembered her dizzy but very sexy blonde performance.In 1951, Marilyn got a fairly sizable role in Love Nest (1951). The public was now getting to know her and liked what it saw. She had an intoxicating quality of volcanic sexuality wrapped in an aura of almost childlike innocence. In 1952, Marilyn appeared in Don\'t Bother to Knock (1952), in which she played a somewhat mentally unbalanced babysitter. Critics didn\'t particularly care for her work in this picture, but she made a much more favorable impression later in the year in Monkey Business (1952), where she was seen for the first time as a platinum blonde, a look that became her trademark. The next year, she appeared in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) as Lorelei Lee. It was also the same year she began dating the baseball great Joe DiMaggio.Marilyn was now a genuine box-office drawing card. Later, she appeared with Betty Grable, Lauren Bacall and Rory Calhoun in How to Marry a Millionaire (1953). Although her co-stars got the rave reviews, it was the sight of Marilyn that really excited the audience, especially the male members. On Thursday, January 14th, 1954, Marilyn wed DiMaggio, then proceeded to film There\'s No Business Like Show Business (1954). That was quickly followed by The Seven Year Itch (1955), which showcased her considerable comedic talent and contained what is arguably one of the most memorable moments in cinema history: Marilyn standing above a subway grating and the wind from a passing subway blowing her white dress up.By October 1954, Marilyn announced her divorce from DiMaggio. The union lasted only eight months. In 1955, she was suspended by Fox for not reporting for work on How to Be Very, Very Popular (1955). It was her second suspension, the first being for not reporting for the production of The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955). Both roles went to others. Her work was slowing down, due to her habit of being continually late to the set, her illnesses (whether real or imagined) and generally being unwilling to cooperate with her producers, directors, and fellow actors.However in Bus Stop (1956), Marilyn finally showed critics that she could play a straight dramatic role. It was also the same year she married playwright, Arthur Miller (they divorced in 1960). In 1957, Marilyn flew to Britain to film The Prince and the Showgirl (1957) which proved less than impressive critically and financially. It made money, but many critics panned it for being slow-moving. After a year off in 1958, Marilyn returned to the screen the next year for the delightful comedy, Some Like It Hot (1959) with Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. The film was an absolute smash hit, with Curtis and Lemmon pretending to be females in an all-girl band, so they can get work. This was to be Marilyn\'s only film for the year.In 1960, Marilyn appeared in George Cukor\'s Let\'s Make Love (1960), with Tony Randall and Yves Montand. Again, while it made money, it was critically panned as stodgy and slow-moving. The following year, Marilyn made what was to be her final film. The Misfits (1961), which also proved to be the final film for the legendary Clark Gable, who died later that year of a heart attack. The film was popular with critics and the public alike. In 1962, Marilyn was chosen to star in Fox\'s Something\'s Got to Give (1962). Again, her absenteeism caused delay after delay in production, resulting in her being fired from the production in June of that year. It looked as though her career was finished. Studios just didn\'t want to take a chance on her because it would cost them thousands of dollars in delays. She was only 36 years old.Marilyn made only 30 films in her lifetime, but her legendary status and mysticism will remain with film history forever.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Denny Jackson          Spouse (3) Arthur Miller (29 June\xa01956            - 20 January\xa01961)\xa0(divorced)           Joe DiMaggio (14 January\xa01954            - 31 October\xa01955)\xa0(divorced)           James Dougherty (19 June\xa01942            - 13 September\xa01946)\xa0(divorced)          Trade Mark (4)        Lisp, breathless voice        Platinum blonde hair        Voluptuous figure        Beauty spot on cheekTrivia (134)      Voted \'Sexiest Woman of the Century\' by People Magazine.

She was Playboy\'s first ""Sweetheart of the Month"" in December 1953.      When she died in 1962 at age 36, she left an estate valued at $1.6 million. In her will, Monroe bequeathed 75% of that estate to Lee Strasberg, her acting coach, and 25% to Dr. Marianne Kris, her psychoanalyst. A trust fund provided her mother, Gladys Baker Eley, with $5,000 a year. When Dr. Kris died in 1980, she passed her 25% on to the Anna Freud Centre, a children\'s psychiatric institute in London. Since Strasberg\'s death in 1982, his 75% has been administered by his widow, Anna, and her lawyer, Irving Seidman.

Ex-husband Joe DiMaggio put fresh roses at her memorial site, for numerous years after her death.      When putting her imprints at Grauman\'s she joked that Jane Russell was best known for her large front-side and she was known for her wiggly walk, so Jane could lean over, and she could sit in it. It was only a joke, but she dotted the ""I"" in her name with a rhinestone, which was stolen within days.      Redheaded actress Tina Louise played the character role of Ginger Grant on the television series Gilligan\'s Island (1964), was loosely based on her personality, but a different hair color.      Her first modeling job paid only five dollars.      Frequently used Nivea moisturizer.      During the filming of Niagara (1953), she was still under contract as a stock actor, thus, she received less salary than her make-up man. This was also the only film in which her character died. The film was reworked to highlight her after Anne Bancroft withdrew.      Often carried around the book, ""The Biography of Abraham Lincoln.""      Was an outstanding player on the Hollygrove Orphanage softball team.      Because the bathing suit she wore in the movie Love Nest (1951) was so risque (for the time period) and caused such a commotion on the set, director Joseph M. Newman had to make it a closed set when she was filming.      Fearing blemishes and sweat, she washed her face fifteen times a day.      She was suggested as a possible wife for Prince Rainier of Monaco. But he picked actress, Grace Kelly, to be his wife.      Thought the right side of her face was her ""best"" side.

Offered to convert to Catholism in order to marry Joe DiMaggio in a Church ceremony, but she was turned down because she was divorced. Subsequently, when the divorced DiMaggio married Marilyn in a civil ceremony at San Francisco City Hall, he was automatically excommunicated by the Church; this edict was struck down by Pope John XXIII\'s Ecumenical Council (Vatican II) in 1962.      Although it\'s believed that her mother, Gladys Baker, named her after Norma Talmadge, Gladys reportedly told her daughter, Bernice (Marilyn\'s half-sister), that she named Marilyn after Norma Jeane Cohen, a child she was Nanny to while living in Louisville, KY. while her son Robert Kermit Baker (Marilyn\'s half brother) was in Hospital, and estranged from the father Jasper Baker.

Def Leppard\'s single ""Photograph"" from their ""Pyromania"" album was also written about Monroe. Glenn Danzig, lead singer of the punk band The Misfits, recorded a song called ""Who Killed Marilyn?"", inspired by his belief that she had been murdered. She is mentioned in the lyrics of several other songs, including ""Celluloid Heroes"" by The Kinks, ""We Didn\'t Start the Fire"" by Billy Joel, ""Vogue"" by Madonna, ""Lady Nina"" by rock band Marillion and ""Tell Me It\'s Not True"" from the musical ""Blood Brothers"".      Her behavior on the unfinished Something\'s Got to Give (1962) dimmed her reputation in the industry, but she was still big box office at the time of her death. What a Way to Go! (1964) and The Stripper (1963) were being developed for her.      When she was told that she was not the star in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) she verbally said ""Well whatever I am, I\'m still the blonde."".      The famous nude photo of her by Tom Kelley originally appeared as anonymous on a calendar entitled ""Miss Golden Dreams."" In 1952, a blackmailer threatened to identify the model as Marilyn, but she shrewdly thwarted the scheme by announcing the fact herself. Hugh M. Hefner then bought the rights to use the photo for $500. She became ""The Sweetheart of the Month"" in the first issue of Hefner\'s magazine, Playboy. Neither Kelley or Monroe ever saw a dime of the millions the calendar made for its publisher.      Formed her own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions, with Milton H. Greene, on December 31, 1955.      Appears on sleeve of The Beatles\' ""Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band"" album.

She left her job and signed with Emmeline Snively\'s modeling agency.      Was referenced in the dialogue of La dolce vita (1960), in the context of dieting.      The Emily Ann Faulkner/Rita Shawn character (played by Kim Stanley) in the John Cromwell film The Goddess (1958) was based on her.

Ten days in advance, on Saturday, May 19th, 1962, she performed for U.S. President John F. Kennedy at his 45th birthday tribute in his honor at Madison Square Garden. She sang ""Happy Birthday"". (Kennedy\'s real birthday was May 29th).      After discovering her dress was torn, at the 1950 Academy Awards, she burst into tears.      Was named #6 Actress on The American Film Institute\'s 50 Greatest Screen Legends.      The dress Marilyn Monroe wore to serenade John F. Kennedy, on May 19, 1962 at his birthday celebration was so tight, that it had to be sewn onto her. She had to sit still for approximately an hour.      In 1999, a make-up kit that she personally owned, sold for $266,500.      One of the first Los Angeles natives to become a major movie star.      Aside from her birth name of Norma Jeane Mortenson, she was baptized and mainly known throughout her life as Norma Jeane Baker. During her modeling days she was also known as Norma Jeane Dougherty (her first marriage name), and also as Jean Norman. When she signed with 20th Century-Fox, studio casting executive Ben Lyon had first chosen the name Carol Lind as her stage name, although she disliked that. Eventually she chose her mother\'s maiden name of Monroe. Three names were drawn up as possible stage names. The first was Norma Jeane Monroe, although that sounded awkward; the second was Jean Monroe, and the third was Marilyn Monroe, the latter first name being chosen by Lyon who thought Norma Jeane resembled famed stage actress Marilyn Miller. Norma Jeane liked Jean Monroe, for it preserved some of her name, but Lyon convinced her that Marilyn Monroe sounded more alliterative and so it was chosen.      She took acting lessons from Michael Chekhov.Sergei Parajanov made collages of Monroe, Charles Chaplin, Mona Lisa, and other famous personages and many were featured in Mikhail Vartanov\'s Parajanov: The Last Spring (1992).      A 1982 review into the original inquest of Marilyn\'s death, conducted on its 20-year anniversary, concluded that the actress committed suicide or accidentally overdosed, and was not murdered--rumors that were fueled by the sloppy handling of evidence, the delay in securing the scene and the disappearance of tissue samples.      The ADR stage at Twentieth Century Fox is named after her.      In 1972, actress Veronica Hamel and her husband became the new owners of Marilyn\'s Brentwood home. They hired a contractor to replace the roof and remodel the house, and the contractor discovered a sophisticated eavesdropping and telephone tapping system that covered every room in the house. The components were not commercially available in 1962, but were in the words of a retired Justice Department official, ""standard FBI issue."" This discovery lent further support to claims of conspiracy theorists that Marilyn had been under surveillance by the Kennedys and the Mafia. The new owners spent $100,000 to remove the bugging devices from the house.      Was good friends with Dorothy Dandridge and Ava Gardner when they were all young, struggling actresses in Hollywood.      When budding actresses Shelley Winters and Marilyn were roommates in the late 1940s in Hollywood, Shelley said that one day she had to step out and asked Marilyn to ""wash the lettuce"" for a salad they were to share for dinner. When Shelley got back to the apartment, (Marilyn was apparently new to the art of cooking) had the leaves of lettuce in a small tub of soapy water and was scrubbing them clean. She had not heard of the phrase before either, or did not know it\'s true meaning.      Her real father was Charles Stanley Gifford. From his side, she was descended from the founder of Rhode Island, Roger Williams, and religious leader Anne Marbury-Hutchinson, from whom she is related to Lucretia Rudolph (wife of President James A. Garfield), Grover Cleveland, William Howard Taft, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, George Bush, and George W. Bush.      In How to Marry a Millionaire (1953), her character Pola is reading a book called ""Murder By Strangulation"" on the plane. Coincidentally, this is how her character was murdered in Niagara (1953).      Friend of James Haspiel.Don\'t Bother to Knock (1952) (her 18th film) was an attempt to prove to critics that she could act successfully. Because some earlier films took numerous takes and much longer time to complete. Especially, The Seven Year Itch (1955) which took numerous extra takes, for her character role, alone.      In Italy, her films were dubbed at the beginning of her career by Miranda Bonansea. As she matured she was dubbed by the marvellous and prolific Rosetta Calavetta with immense success, particularly in Some Like It Hot (1959). Zoe Incrocci lent her voice to Monroe once: in All About Eve (1950).      Her lifelong bouts with depression and self-destruction took their toll during filming The Seven Year Itch (1955). She frequently muffed scenes and forgot her lines, leading to sometimes as many as 40 takes of a scene before a satisfactory result was produced. Her constant tardiness and behavioral problems made the budget of the film swell to $1.8 million, a high price for the time. The film still managed to make a nice profit. The classic shot of her dress blowing up around her legs as she stands over a subway grating in this film was originally shot on Manhattan\'s Lexington Avenue at 52nd St., On Wednesday, September 15th, 1954, at 1:00 a.m. Five thousand onlookers whistled and cheered through take after take as Marilyn repeatedly missed her lines. This occurred in presence of an increasingly embarrassed and angry Joe DiMaggio (her husband at the time; the nine-month-old marriage officially ended during the shooting of this film). The original footage shot on that night in New York never made it to the screen; the noise of the crowd had made it unusable. Director Billy Wilder re-shot the scene on the 20th Century-Fox lot, on a set replicating Lexington Avenue, and got a more satisfactory result. However, it took another 40 takes for Marilyn to achieve the famous scene. Amazingly, her very narrow spike heels don\'t get stuck or break in the subway grating, although this was a universal problem at the time for the countless women wearing that very popular style heel in New York City in that era. An important promotional campaign was released for this mainstream motion picture, including a 52-foot-high cutout of Marilyn (from the blowing dress scene) erected in front of Loews State Theater, in New York City\'s Times Square. The movie premiere was on June 1, 1955, which was also her 29th birthday.      Was originally set to play Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany\'s (1961), but Audrey Hepburn played the role instead.What a Way to Go! (1964) initially intended as a vehicle for her, Shirley MacLaine played Louisa May Foster instead. Producer Arthur P. Jacobs was her publicist and J. Lee Thompson was on her list of approved directors.      She resided at the Hollywood Roosevelt while she was breaking into the acting business.      Her ""Happy Birthday Mr. President"" dress sold for $1,267,500.00, a world record for the most expensive piece of clothing ever sold, and is in the Guinness Book of World Records.      She left Hollywood to pursue serious acting by studying under Lee Strasberg at his Actors\' Studio in New York City.      Her classic shape, according to her dressmaker, is actually measured at 37-23-36.      In 1946, she signed her first studio contract with 20th Century Fox and dyed her hair.      Spent most of her early childhood in foster homes and orphanages because her mother was committed to a mental institution. Later, she lived with her mother\'s best friend, Grace McKee, and her family. McKee, a big fan of Jean Harlow, allowed her to wear make-up and curl her hair and, when she was 15, it was McKee who pierced her ears for her using a sewing needle. At 16, when McKee could no longer take care of her, she got married to avoid returning to the orphanage.      Producer Keya Morgan owns her Bible.      When she married Joe DiMaggio, the couple moved into a home at 508 N. Palm Drive in Beverly Hills, that was next door to Jean Harlow\'s last home.      She tried 9 different shades of blonde hair color before settling on platinum blonde.      Her personal library contained over 400 books on topics ranging from art to history, psychology, philosophy, literature, religion, poetry, and gardening. Many of the volumes, auctioned in 1999, bore her pencil notations in the margins.      There are over 600 books written about her.      Nearly 11 years after her death, she appeared on the cover of the Tuesday, July 17th, 1973 edition of ""Time Magazine"" in a full-color portrait taken by Bert Stern, from the last photographic sitting before her death. The cover-story heralds the publication of ""Marilyn,"" the biography of her by Norman Mailer. On the cover, her image dwarfs a black & white photo of Mailer. Mailer reportedly was displeased that ""Time"" chose to play up Monroe and diminish him, visually on the cover. The publication of the coffee table biography, which contained many photographs including several by Stern, was a major event of that publishing season. The book retailed for $19.95, which is approximately $100 in 2008 money, when factored for inflation.      ""Time Magazine"" reported in 1973 that Los Angeles County coroner Thomas Noguchi, the doctor who performed Monroe\'s autopsy, said that contrary to rumors, Monroe\'s stomach was never pumped after her death. The level of Nembutal in her bloodstream was 4.5 milligrams per 100, which is the equivalent of 40 or 50 capsules indicating suicide.      In 1961, after her divorce from Arthur Miller, she purchased a 2900 square foot hacienda style house in Brentwood, for $77,500.      Featured in ""Femme Noir: Bad Girls of Film"" by Karen Burroughs Hannsberry (McFarland, 1998).      Her last film Something\'s Got to Give (1962), was finally released in 2003. In the swimming pool scene, Marilyn reveals much more to the camera than she did in her then controversial calendar photo from the early 1950s.      Was in consideration for the part of Adelaide in Guys and Dolls (1955), but Vivian Blaine was cast instead.      Although she was perhaps the most famous actress of the 1950s decade, she never made more than $100,000 per picture upfront. Actresses such as Elizabeth Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck were earning significantly more.      Former stepmother of Robert A. Miller.      Half-sister of Berniece and Robert Kermitt Baker (but she never knew him, because he died at 14) by her mother\'s side. Sister-in-law of Paris Miracle, aunt of Mona Rae Miracle.      Became pregnant twice (in July 1957 and November 1958) during her marriage to Arthur Miller; on both occasions she suffered miscarriages.      Although she was an avid buyer of books and owned over 400 of them at her death, third husband Arthur Miller said, ""Aside from Colette\'s Cheri and a few short stories, I had never known her to read anything all the way through. She felt she could get the idea of a book, and often did, in just a few pages."".      Read and wrote poetry.      Ranked #3 in Men\'s Health 100 Hottest Women of all Time (2011).      Was a lifelong liberal Democrat.      Was close friends with singer Ella Fitzgerald and helped her rise in her musical career by arranging for her to sing in many upscale nightclubs some of which were segregated during the time of their friendship.      Monroe was a stutterer, a little known fact that was easily covered thanks to studio vocal coaches who provided her with diction lessons.      Learned to play the guitar for her role in River of No Return (1954) and the ukulele for her role in Some Like It Hot (1959).      Former sister-in-law of Joan Copeland, Vince DiMaggio, and Dominic DiMaggio. She and Joan shared the same birthday (June 1).      Film editor Dann Cahn recommended a young woman he was dating for the part of a beautiful young woman in Your Show Time (1949). Producer Stanley Rubin auditioned her and turned her down because she did not have enough experience. The young woman\'s name was Marilyn Monroe.      She was scheduled for The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955), but she was thought too old at 30 when the character was supposed to be 17 so she was replaced with Joan Collins.      According to Adam Curtis\' ""The Century of Self"", Monroe was in the later years subjected to an experimental kind of therapy where she was forced to attend the rituals of an average family and then expected to model her self upon the experience. Arthur Miller commented in the same documentary ""I don\'t think suffering is always a mistake"".Ayn Rand wrote a powerful tribute to her, compiled in ""The Voice of Reason"".      Although Monroe\'s famous nude calender grossed $750,000, the actress only got $50 and a bad cold out of it.      After working with Monroe in As Young as You Feel (1951) jealous co-star Constance Bennett wisecracked, ""Now there\'s a broad with a future behind her!"".      Among roles that Monroe turned down under her Fox contract: ""Pink Tights,"" ""How To Be Very, Very Popular,"" ""The Revolt of Mamie Stover,"" ""The Girl in the Red velvet Swing,\' ""The Jean Harlow Story,"" ""The Blue Angel,"" and ""Can-Can."".      She campaigned to play the Maria Schell role in ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" but she was never seriously considered.      According to the book ""Flesh and Fantasy"" Monroe perfected a Vaseline-based lip gloss.      ""Goodbye, Charlie"" with Debbie Reynolds, and ""The Stripper"" with Joanne Woodward were originally slated by Fox as Monroe projects.      Director Billy Wilder was quoted as saying, ""The great success of Monroe... was that she did not infuriate the female."".      Was good friends with Judy Garland.      Played by Mary Hanson in Hollywood Mouth 2 (2014). The director of that film, Jordan Mohr, had portrayed Marilyn\'s rival Simone Signoret in the stage play ""Two Simones: de Beauvoir and Signoret in Hollywood"".      Richard Widmark on co-starring with Monroe in ""Don\'t Bother to Knock"": ""She was a vulnerable kid. Murder to work with because she was scared to death of acting - even when she became a big movie actress. We had a hell of a time getting her out of the dressing room. When it was five o\'clock , it got irritating: \'C\'mon, Marilyn, we want to go home!\' She was a movie animal. Something happened between the lens and the film. Nobody knew what the hell it was. On the set, you\'d think: \'Oh, this is impossible; you can\'t print this.\' You\'d see it, and she\'s got everyone backed off the screen. Olivier said the same thing. She had that phenomenal something! Nobody knows what it is, but she had it. She certainly was never a professional actress. She always had a coach with her, lurking in the background, giving her signals. And she could never remember three words in a row - so it was all piece-work. Beyond all the technical deficiencies, she was a nice girl. We got along fine."".      Is one of 20 actresses who did not receive an Oscar nomination for their Best Actress in a Comedy/Musical Golden Globe-winning performance; hers being for Some Like It Hot (1959).

In order to fall asleep quicker and stay asleep longer she often mixed champagne with sleeping pills.      Became friends with Exotic Animal Trainer Ralph Helfer while working together in the movie River of No Return (1954) and got very attached to his Raccoon named Bandit.      In November 2016, the dress worn by Monroe while singing ""Happy Birthday"" to President John F. Kennedy at his 1962 birthday celebration was sold for $4.8 million, a record amount for a dress sold at auction. This surpassed the previous record for a dress sold at auction, which was also held by a dress worn by Monroe: the white dress she wore in The Seven Year Itch (1955) fetched $4.6 million in 2011.      Marilyn Monroe was 36 when she was found dead in her Beverly Hills-West Hollywood home on an early Sunday morning, August 5, 1962, just less than two and a half months after she appeared at New York City\'s Madison Square Garden, on a Saturday evening, May 19, 1962. The event was staged and produced by Broadway composer and lyricist Richard Adler. It was choreographed by Carol Haney of ""The Pajama Game"" fame. The Democratic event rally was a fund raising gala for the Democratic Party, the evening\'s program highlight, a celebration of John F. Kennedy\'s forty-fifth birthday, ten days before his actual birth-date on Tuesday, May 29, 1962, before 15,000 invited guests, Marilyn Monroe to sing ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President"" to President John F. Kennedy. Monroe sang the traditional ""Happy Birthday to You"" lyrics in a sultry, intimate voice, with ""Mr. President"" inserted as Kennedy\'s name. She continued the song with a snippet from the classic song, ""Thanks for the Memory"", for which she had written new lyrics specifically aimed at Kennedy. ""Thanks, Mr. President, For all the things you\'ve done, The battles that you\'ve won, The way you deal with U.S. Steel, And our problems by the ton, We thank you so much."" That moment in New York City, as we look back on it today in a grainy video, is frozen in time with all its possibilities still before it. We see celebration, joy, life. And we know too much about the future. Maybe that\'s why the gown Marilyn wore is worth $4.8 million. Because people will line up to see it, to stand next to something that once sparkled in the presence of greatness, of triumph, of happiness. The gown that broke the November 2016 auction record, was a creation of Hollywood film costume designer Jean Louis, with the original sketch executed by 19 year old costume illustrator Bob Mackie. Made of sheer silk marquisette-gauze fabric, the flesh-colored gown was hand-sewn with over 2,500 rhinestone-crystals, originally cost $1,440.33. It was tailored by an atelier so close to the body that Monroe was sewn into it before she walked onto the stage. The dress sold in 1999 at an auction in New York for over US $1.26 million. A new bidder subsequently purchased the dress in November 17, 2016. Peter Lawford was at the event that night to introduce Monroe. He made a play on the actress\'s reputation for tardiness by giving her a number of introductions throughout the night, building anticipation, after which she did not appear on stage. When Monroe finally appeared in a spotlight, Lawford introduced her as the ""late Marilyn Monroe"". Monroe peeled off her white ermine fur coat, revealing the dress, and the audience gasped. The film video of the event when actor Peter Lawford includes the downright eerie introduction of Monroe\'s missed cue for her entrance. ""Mr. President,"" Lawford says, leaning into the microphone, ""the LATE Marilyn Monroe."" As Lawford takes her white ermine coat, a thousand voices in the audience let out a gasp of ""Oh!"" at the sight of the gown, and the woman underneath it. According to Los Angeles\' Julien\'s Auctions, Marilyn was the only thing underneath the sheer gown, the dress was so tight that Monroe wore nothing else. Rumors of an affair between the president and the film star were sparked by the absence of Jacqueline Kennedy from the 45th birthday celebration, and by the sultry and suggestive performance. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who rarely attended Democratic Party events, spent the day at the Loudon Hunt Horse Show with her children John-John and Caroline. ""I can now retire from politics after having had \'Happy Birthday\' sung to me in such a sweet, wholesome manner,"" alluding to Marilyn\'s delivery, skintight dress, and image as a sex symbol, JFK said, when he stood alone at the lectern a few minutes later. Monroe had been spirited away from the microphone while the cameras were distracted by the entrance of an enormous birthday cake carried in on the shoulders of two men in chefs\' jackets. The November, 2016, buyer Ripley\'s Entertainment Inc., the company that operates ""Ripley\'s Believe It or Not! Museum"" in Hollywood, California, paid $4.8 million at auction. The company plans to display the dress there and also take it on tour. In 2017, Ripley\'s is celebrating its 100th year anniversary, and the ""Marilyn Monroe\'s \'Happy Birthday, Mr. President\' gown"" will be prominently featured, as it should be. Surviving to 100 and still overspending on dresses is something to celebrate. JFK was assassinated at age 46, eighteen months later after his Madison Square Garden 45th ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President"" birthday celebration, at 12:30pm Central Time, on a Friday noon motorcade parade, November 22, 1963, in Dealy Plaza in Dallas, Texas.      Subject of song ""Marilyn Monroe"" by Phoebe Legere.      Born on the same day as Andy Griffith.Personal Quotes (116)      I love a natural look in pictures. I like people with a feeling one way or another - it shows an inner life. I like to see that there\'s something going on inside them.      My problem is that I drive myself... I\'m trying to become an artist, and to be true, and sometimes I feel I\'m on the verge of craziness, I\'m just trying to get the truest part of myself out, and it\'s very hard. There are times when I think, \'All I have to be is true\'. But sometimes it doesn\'t come out so easily. I always have this secret feeling that I\'m really a fake or something, a phony.      [on living with the Bolenders when she was a little girl] They were terribly strict. They didn\'t mean any harm . . . it was their religion. They brought me up harshly.      [on meeting Joe DiMaggio for the first time] I was surprised to be so crazy about Joe. I expected a flashy New York sports type, and instead I met this reserved guy who didn\'t make a pass at me right away! He treated me like something special. Joe is a very decent man, and he makes other people feel decent, too.      [on why Joe DiMaggio didn\'t accompany her on one of her USO tours] Joe hates crowds and glamor.      [on why she divorced James Dougherty] My marriage didn\'t make me sad, but it didn\'t make me happy either. My husband and I hardly spoke to each other. This wasn\'t because we were angry. We had nothing to say. I was dying of boredom.      [on why her marriage to Joe DiMaggio didn\'t work] I didn\'t want to give up my career, and that\'s what Joe wanted me to do most of all.      I want to be a big star more than anything. It\'s something precious.      [on her favorite actress] Jean Harlow was my idol.      [on drifting in and out of orphanages when she was little] The world around me then was kind of grim. I had to learn to pretend in order to - I don\'t know - block the grimness. The whole world seemed sort of closed to me . . . [I felt] on the outside of everything, and all I could do was to dream up any kind of pretend game.      [on her early marriage to James Dougherty] Grace McKee arranged the marriage for me, I never had a choice. There\'s not much to say about it. They couldn\'t support me, and they had to work out something. And so I got married.      I\'m not interested in money, I just want to be wonderful.      A career is wonderful, but you can\'t curl up with it on a cold night.      Sometimes I think it would be easier to avoid old age, to die, young, but then you\'d never complete your life, would you? You\'d never wholly know yourself...      A dollar for your thoughts...      I\'ve been on a calendar, but never on time.      No one ever told me I was pretty when I was a little girl. All little girls should be told they\'re pretty, even if they aren\'t.      In Hollywood a girl\'s virtue is much less important than her hairdo. You\'re judged by how you look, not by what you are. Hollywood\'s a place where they\'ll pay you a thousand dollars for kiss, and fifty cents for your soul. I know, because I turned down the first offer often enough and held out for the fifty.      Dogs never bite me. Just humans.      Sex is a part of nature. I go along with nature.      Fame will go by and, so long, I\'ve had you, Fame. If it goes by, I\'ve always known it was fickle.      I knew I belonged to the public and to the world, not because I was talented or even beautiful, but because I never had belonged to anything or anyone else.      People had a habit of looking at me as if I were some kind of mirror instead of a person. They didn\'t see me, they saw their own lewd thoughts, then they white-masked themselves by calling me the lewd one.      A sex-symbol becomes a thing, I just hate being a thing. But if I\'m going to be a symbol of something I\'d rather have it sex than some other things we\'ve got symbols of.      The truth is I\'ve never fooled anyone. I\'ve let people fool themselves. They didn\'t bother to find out who and what I was. Instead they would invent a character for me. I wouldn\'t argue with them. They were obviously loving somebody I wasn\'t. When they found this out, they would blame me for disillusioning them---and fooling them.      To put it bluntly, I seem to have a whole superstructure with no foundation. But I\'m working on the foundation.      If I had observed all the rules, I\'d never have gotten anywhere.      I want to grow old without face-lifts... I want to have the courage to be loyal to the face that I have made.      It\'s often just enough to be with someone. I don\'t need to touch them. Not even talk. A feeling passes between you both. You\'re not alone.      I\'m a failure as a woman. My men expect so much of me, because of the image they\'ve made of me and that I\'ve made of myself, as a sex symbol. Men expect so much, and I can\'t live up to it.      It stirs up envy, fame does. People you run into feel that, well, who does she think she is, Marilyn Monroe? They feel fame gives them some kind of privilege to walk up to you and say anything to you, you know, of any kind of nature - and it won\'t hurt your feelings.      Fame is fickle, and I know it. It has it\'s compensations but it also has it\'s drawbacks, and I\'ve experienced them both.      My illusions didn\'t have anything to do with being a fine actress. I knew how third rate I was. I could actually feel my lack of talent, as if it were cheap clothes I was wearing inside. But my God, how I wanted to learn, to change, to improve!      If I play a stupid girl, and ask a stupid question, I\'ve got to follow it through. What am I supposed to do, look intelligent?      [on her famous nude calendar pose in 1949] My sin has been no more than I have written, posing for the nude because I desperately needed 50 dollars to get my car out of hock.      An actor is supposed to be a sensitive instrument. Isaac Stern takes good care of his violin. What if everyone jumped on his violin?      There was my name up in lights. I said, ""God, somebody\'s made a mistake!"" But there it was in lights. And I sat there and said, ""Remember, you\'re not a star"". Yet there it was up in lights.      Some people have been unkind. If I say I want to grow as an actress, they look at my figure. If I say I want to develop, to learn my craft, they laugh. Somehow they don\'t expect me to be serious about my work.      I was never used to being happy, so that wasn\'t something I ever took for granted. I did sort of think, you know, marriage did that. You see, I was brought up differently from the average American child because the average child is brought up expecting to be happy - that\'s it, successful, happy, and on time.      You know, when you grow up you can get kind of sour, I mean, that\'s the way it can go.      Wouldn\'t it be nice to be like men and get notches in your belt and sleep with most attractive men and not get emotionally involved?      I used to think as I looked at the Hollywood night, ""There must be thousands of girls sitting alone like me, dreaming of becoming a movie star. But I\'m not going to worry about them. I\'m dreaming the hardest.""      The trouble with censors is they worry if a girl has cleavage. They ought to worry if she hasn\'t any.      I used to say to myself, ""What the devil have you got to be proud about, Marilyn Monroe?"" And I\'d answer, ""Everything, everything"".      [on stardom] It scares me. All those people I don\'t know, sometimes they\'re so emotional. I mean, if they love you that much without knowing you, they can also hate you the same way.      [Johann Wolfgang von Goethe] said, ""Talent is developed in privacy"", you know? And it\'s really true. There is a need for aloneness which I don\'t think most people realize for an actor. It\'s almost having certain kinds of secrets for yourself that you\'ll let the whole world in on only for a moment, when you\'re acting.      I want to be an artist, an actress with integrity.      I\'ve never dropped anyone I believed in.      [on John F. Kennedy] It would be so nice to have a president who looks so young and good-looking.      I restore myself when I\'m alone. A career is born in public -- talent in private.      Talent is developed in privacy... but everybody is always tugging at you. They\'d all like sort of a chunk at you. They\'d kind of like to take pieces out of you.      I want to be an artist... not an erotic freak. I don\'t want to be sold to the public as a celluloid aphrodisiacal.      [about Montgomery Clift] He\'s the only person I know that is in worse shape than I am.      I\'ve never liked the name Marilyn. I\'ve often wished that I had held out that day for Jean Monroe. But I guess it\'s too late to do anything about it now.      [on Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift] Marlon\'s kinda hard to tie down, they say. He\'s never sure what he wants to do. He and Monty Clift have a lot in common, though they\'re totally different people, but they don\'t plan their careers too well and they\'re not ambitious enough for their talents.      Personally, I react to Marlon Brando. He\'s a favorite of mine.      [on Frank Sinatra] He is a man at the top of his profession and is a fine actor as well. You know, he got an Oscar for From Here to Eternity (1953). He has helped more people anonymously than anybody else. And the miserable press smears him with lies about his being involved with the Mafia and gangsters. And Frank just takes it.      [on Mae West] A nice lady even though she turned down making a picture with me. That just shows how smart she is.      Speaking of Oscars, I would win overwhelmingly if the Academy gave an Oscar for faking orgasms. I have done some of my best acting convincing my partners I was in the throes of ecstasy.      [on Laurence Olivier on the set of The Prince and the Showgirl (1957)] Olivier came into my dressing room to give me hell for screwing up. I soothed him by telling him I thought his Hamlet (1948) was one of the greatest films ever made. You know he won an Oscar for it.      When Clark Gable died, I cried for 2 days straight. I couldn\'t eat or sleep.      [on Sigmund Freud] I read his ""Introductory Lectures,"" God, what a genius. He makes it so understandable. And he is so right. Didn\'t he say himself that [William Shakespeare] and [Fyodor Dostoevsky] had a better understanding of psychology than all the scientists put together? Damn it, they do.      [on James Joyce and the character of Molly Bloom in Ulysses] Here is Joyce writing what a woman thinks to herself. Can he, does he really know her innermost thoughts? But after I read the whole book, I could better understand that Joyce is an artist who could penetrate the souls of people, male or female. It really doesn\'t matter that Joyce doesn\'t have...or never felt a menstrual cramp. To me Leopold Bloom is a central character. He is the despised Irish Jew, married to an Irish Catholic woman. It is through them Joyce develops much of what he wants to say. Do you agree that the scene where Bloom is looking at the little girl on the swing is the most erotic in the book?      [on John F. Kennedy] When he has finished his achievements, he will take his place with Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and [Franklin D. Roosevelt] as one of our greatest Presidents. I\'m glad he has [Robert F. Kennedy]. It\'s like the Navy. The President is the Captain and Bobby is his Executive Officer. Bobby would do absolutely anything for his brother. And so would I. I\'ll never embarrass him. As long as I have memory, I have John Fitzgerald Kennedy.      [on Sunday being the loneliest day of the week for her] All the men I know are spending the day with their wives and families, and all the stores in Los Angeles are closed. You can\'t wander through looking at all the pretty clothes and pretending to buy something.      [on Marlon Brando] He\'s very sweet and tender, not at all the Stanley Kowalski rapist people think he is.Arthur Miller wouldn\'t have married me if I had been nothing but a dumb blonde.      I have always been deeply terrified to really be someone\'s wife since I know from life one cannot love another, ever, really.      [on Peter Lawford] I have a need to be frightened and nothing really in my personal relationships and dealings lately have been frightening me, except for him. I felt very uneasy at different times with him, the real reason I was afraid of him is because I believe him to be homosexual...Peter wants to be a woman and would like to be me, I think.      Hollywood is a place where they\'ll pay you $50,000 for a kiss and 50c for your soul.      It\'s better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone.      It was the creative part that kept me going, trying to be an actress. I enjoy acting when you really hit it right.      I did what they said and all it got me was a lot of abuse. Everyone\'s just laughing at me. I hate it. Big breasts, big ass, big deal.      [on Arthur Miller\'s script for \'The Misfits\'] Arthur did this to me. He could have written anything and he comes up with this. If that\'s what he thinks of me, well, then I\'m not for him and he\'s not for me. Arthur says it\'s his movie. I don\'t think he even wants me in it.      I won\'t be satisfied until people want to hear me sing without looking at me.      The body is meant to be seen, not all covered up.      I love to do things that censors won\'t pass.      I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they\'re right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.      I have feelings too. I am still human. All I want is to be loved, for myself and for my talent.      I knew I belonged to the public and to the world, not because I was talented or even beautiful, but because I had never belonged to anything or anyone else.      Boys think girls are like books, If the cover doesn\'t catch their eye they won\'t bother to read what\'s inside.      [on shooting the famous scene in The Seven Year Itch (1955) where wind from the subway beneath blows her skirt up] At first it was all innocent and fun, but when Billy Wilder kept shooting the scene over and over the crowd of men kept on applauding and shouting, \'More, more Marilyn - let\'s see more.\' What was supposed to be a fun scene turned into a sex scene.      I\'ve often stood silent at a party for hours listening to my movie idols turn into dull and little people.      When you\'re young and healthy you can plan on Monday to commit suicide, and by Wednesday you\'re laughing again.      Suicide is a person\'s privilege. I don\'t believe it\'s a sin or a crime, it\'s your right if you do. Though it doesn\'t get you anywhere.      The other girls rode to school in a bus. I had no nickel to pay for the ride. Rain or shine, I walked the two miles from my ""aunt\'s"" home to the school. I hated the walk, I hated the school. I had no friends. The pupils seldom talked to me and never wanted me in their games. Nobody ever walked home with me or invited me to visit their homes. This was partly because I came from the poor part of the district where all the Mexicans and Japanese lived. It was also because I couldn\'t smile at anyone.      How or why I can act - and I\'m not sure I can - is the thing for me to understand. The torture, let alone the day to day happenings - the pain one cannot explain to another.      Executives can get colds and stay home and phone in - but the actor? How dare you get a cold or a virus! I wish they had to act a comedy with a temperature and a virus infection! I\'m there to give a performance, not to be disciplined by a studio. This isn\'t supposed to be a military school, after all.      [on homosexuality] No sex is wrong if there\'s love involved.      As long as I can remember, I\'ve always loved people.      What the world really needs is a real feeling of kinship. Everybody: stars, laborers, Negroes, Jews, Arabs. We are all brothers. Please don\'t make me a joke. End the interview with what I believe.      People always ask me if I believe diamonds are a girl\'s best friend. Frankly, I don\'t.      I have favorite motion-picture stars, like everyone else. You know who mine are? My favorite is Marlon Brando. I mean, really, I believe we\'d be an interesting combination. I\'ve said that about Marlon for a long time, but we haven\'t found the right story. Can you imagine us on the big screen? I hope something happens soon. Greta Garbo, I\'ve never met her. It really bugs me when I miss one of her films on TV. Oh, if you could only get me to meet her! I\'ve also heard wonderful things about Jeanne Eagels and Laurette Taylor. And the one they called the Blond Bombshell: Jean Harlow. Kay Kendall was a great comedian. She was really talented. I would have loved working with Gerard Philipe, the handsome French star- his films I\'ve been told were a huge success in France, as were his stage plays. I was told he wanted to make films with me. Oh, what a shame we never got the opportunity. We would have made an interesting team. What a shame. He was so young to die; he was thirty-six. He had been ill and apparently died of a heart attack.      Nearly everyone I knew talked to me about God. They always warned me not to offend Him.      Drugs pull you down and shut the lid on life. Pot opens everything up. All the anxieties, the creepy crawly blues, it all just drifts away and you can slowly remember what it feels like to be alive. Even more importantly, you can take a step back from the crap that\'s flying and see what really is important, which of the many things in your life really deserves worrying about. Not much!      [why she converted to Judaism] I believe in everything a little, and if I have kids, I think they should be Jewish. Anyway, I can identify with the Jews. Everybody\'s out to get them no matter what they do.      It might be kind of a relief to be finished. It\'s sort of like you don\'t know what kind of a yard dash you\'re running, but then you\'re at the finish line and you sort of sigh - you\'ve made it! But you never have. You have to start all over again.      I think that sexuality is only attractive when it\'s natural and spontaneous.      I sleep in the nude but I pull the sheets up.      When it comes down to it, I let them think what they want. If they care enough to bother with what I do, then I\'m already better than them.      I remember when I got the part in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Jane Russell, she was the brunette in it and I was the blonde. She got $200,000 for it, and I got my $500 a week, but that to me was, you know, considerable. She, by the way, was quite wonderful to me. The only thing was I couldn\'t get a dressing room. I said, finally, I really got to this kind of level, I said, ""Look, after all, I am the blonde, and it is Gentlemen Prefer Blondes!"" Because still they always kept saying, ""Remember, you\'re not a star."" I said, ""Well, whatever I am, I am the blonde!""      Who said nights were for sleep?      We are all born sexual creatures, thank God, but it\'s a pity so many people despise and crush this natural gift.      I\'m for the individual as opposed to the corporation. The way it is the individual is the underdog, and with all the things a corporation has going for them the individual comes out banged on her head. The artist is nothing. It\'s really tragic.      People had a habit of looking at me like I was some kind of mirror instead of a person. They didn\'t see me, they saw their own lewd thoughts, then they white-masked themselves by calling me the lewd one.      For the first family I lived with, to go to a movie was a sin. Every night I was told to pray that I would not wake up in hell.      There is nothing positive about being fat. And there is nothing positive about loving yourself. We all need to conform to society\'s expectations of who we are and if we don\'t, who will? Life is more enjoyable when you are thin and pretty. I was never fat a day in my life and I never will.      Creativity has got to start with humanity and when you\'re a human being, you feel, you suffer.      Fame is like caviar. It\'s good to have caviar, but not every damned day!      Let yourself go, the pleasure of physical movement is so important. If that\'s a problem, you say to yourself, what is there that I am afraid of, or hiding? Maybe your libido!      I have always felt comfortable in blue jeans. I have found it interesting, however, that people also whistle at blue jeans. I have to admit that I like mine to fit. There\'s nothing I hate worse than baggy blue jeans.      I want the world to see my body.      Men who think that a woman\'s past love affairs lessen her love for them are stupid. A woman can bring a new love to each man that she loves, providing that there are not too many.      The public doesn\'t mind people living together without being married, providing they don\'t overdo it.      Imperfection is beauty, madness is genius, it\'s better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring.      To everyone who thinks they\'re ugly because they\'re not a size 0, you\'re the beautiful one and it\'s society that\'s ugly.Salary (19)The Shocking Miss Pilgrim\xa0(1947)      $75 /week      Dangerous Years\xa0(1947)      $75 /week      Scudda Hoo!

Served as a volunteer overseas during the Korean War, as an alternative to military service. He was invited to the White House by Eisenhower to discuss his service as the administration considered the possibility of a Peace Corps (not realized until Kennedy\'s administration), but he had to decline to due his live-TV commitments.      He played Helen Hunt\'s father in Quarterback Princess (1983) and her grandfather in Peggy Sue Got Married (1986).      Before he was cast as Justinian in The Viking Queen (1967), the role was offered to Christopher Lee but he turned it down.      Originally, Knots Landing (1979) was intended to be a soap opera vehicle for both him & Michele Lee, from the beginning, until he chose to leave the show at the beginning of the third season.

He made his stage debut in the mid 1930s and came into contact with Orson Welles\' Mercury Theatre. As a result, he earned the bit role of a reporter in the final scenes of Citizen Kane (1941). Making little leeway in films, O\'Connell returned to the Broadway lights where he played Polonius in ""Hamlet"" and Banquo in ""Macbeth"", finally gaining considerable attention as the amiable bachelor storekeeper in ""Picnic"" in 1953. He transferred the role successfully to film three years later and began a series of flawed and forlorn characters on TV and the screen from then on. A particular standout was as James Stewart\'s boozed up attorney and mentor in Anatomy of a Murder (1959) for which he won his second Oscar-nomination for ""best supporting actor"" (the first was for Picnic (1956) three years earlier). The mustachioed O\'Connell usually played wise, helpful and friendly, and he also inhabited crafty villains from time to time, but there was always an unhappy ambiance and \'loser\' quality in his elderly gents, which made you feel sorry for him. He played Monte Markham\'s ""son"" (Markham had been frozen in an iceberg, which explains Markham\'s young appearance) in the 1967 sitcom ""The Second Hundred Years"" but the series was short-lived.

Ancestors on her father\'s side were Mayflower colonists Priscilla and John Alden. Her parents divorced while she was still young and Betty eventually learned to speak Spanish while traveling with her mother to various Spanish-speaking countries during her childhood. Mother and daughter settled in Newton, Massachusetts, after the mother remarried. Betty\'s passion for the theatre was sparked during her early teens and by 1932 she was enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Art. She made her professional debut in a 1933 summer stock production of ""The First Mrs. Fraser"" and soon was cast in stage roles elsewhere. She even found work in a London theater production of ""She Loves Me"" in early 1934.Rather plaintive in appearance with flat but highly distinctive tones, Betty\'s Broadway debut came about as an understudy in the comedy ""Page Miss Glory"" in November of 1934, courtesy of George Abbott, in which Betty also had a minor role. Therafter she performed frequently in the comedy mold, and in the service of Abbott, with such delightful plays as ""Three Men on a Horse (1935), ""Boy Meets Girl"" (1936) ""Room Service"" (1937) and ""The Primrose Path (1939), and earning fine reviews for the last two.After seeing her performance on stage as Henry Aldrich\'s girlfriend Barbara in ""What a Life"" (1938), Paramount executives utilized her services when they transferred What a Life (1939) to film. The studio not only liked what they saw but signed her to a seven-year contract. Throughout the 1940s Betty appeared in a variety of leading ingénue and co-star roles. The important part of Mae, the farm girl, in John Steinbeck\'s classic Of Mice and Men (1939) starring Burgess Meredith and Lon Chaney was an early highlight, although it didn\'t provide her the necessary springboard for stardom. Part of the problem was that the rather reserved actress tended to shun the Hollywood scene (she still lived quietly with her mother).While performing for Abbott again on Broadway in ""Ring Two"" (1939), Betty met the show\'s playwright Elmer Rice and the couple married in 1942. Their three children, John Alden, Judith and Paul, would appear on occasion with their mother on the summer stock stage. Betty also enhanced husband Rice\'s plays ""Flight to the West"" (1940) and ""A New Life"" (1943), which were designed especially for her.Betty offered consistent, quality work even when the movies she appeared in met with less-than-stellar reviews. She was afforded the opportunity to work with some of Hollywood\'s finest leading men, including Fredric March in Victory (1940) and Tomorrow, the World! (1944), John Wayne in The Shepherd of the Hills (1941), Robert Cummings in Flesh and Fantasy (1943) and Joel McCrea in The Great Moment (1944). Tops on the list was her heart-tugging performance as the anguished daughter victimized by father Claude Rains in the classic soaper Kings Row (1942).She purposely did not renew her Paramount contract at this point and, following another sterling performance in The Southerner (1945), took a long break from camera work. Back on Broadway, she appeared in such distinguished plays as ""The Voice of the Turtle"" and her husband\'s ""Dream Girl"" (Rice also directed) for career sustenance. She won the New York Drama Critics Circle award for the latter in 1946. Her Hedvig in Ibsen\'s ""The Wild Duck"" was also critically lauded.An isolated return to Paramount to play what should have been a career highlight ended up a major disappointment,. While her Daisy Buchanan in F. Scott Fitzgerald\'s The Great Gatsby (1949) had mixed reviews (some felt she was miscast and not glamorous enough for the part), the movie itself (which was extensively trimmed) and her underwhelming co-star Alan Ladd were also cited as problems. Still a marquee value on Broadway, however, she displayed great range in such fare as ""Twelfth Night"", ""The Rat Race"", ""Peter Pan"" (taking over for Jean Arthur), ""The Fourposter"" (she and Burgess Meredith replaced Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn) and ""Ladies of the Corridor""Betty\'s soulful features took on a hardened, careworn veneer by the time she returned to Hollywood in the mid-1950\'s. Nevertheless, she had a ""Field"" day as a character player appearing in a number of drab, dressed-down roles. She lent credence to a number of fascinatingly flawed small-town moms and matrons in films, among them cream-of-the-crop hits Picnic (1955), starring Kim Novak, Bus Stop (1956) with Marilyn Monroe and Peyton Place (1957) headlining Lana Turner and Hope Lange. The stage plays ""The Seagull"", ""Waltz of the Toreadors"", ""Touch of the Poet"" and ""Separate Tables"" also accentuated this newly mature phase of her career.TV took up a large percentage of Betty\'s time in the 1950s and 1960s with a number of showcase roles. She continued at a fairly steady pace but without much fanfare (as she preferred). Divorced from Rice in 1956, she married and split from lawyer and criminologist Edwin J. Lukas before settling down permanently with husband/artist Raymond Olivere in 1968. Betty\'s swan song in films was a small, featured part in Clint Eastwood\'s Coogan\'s Bluff (1968) as a floozie type, looking noticeably older than she was. Mixing in such stalwart, brittle roles on stage as Amanda in ""The Glass Menagerie"" and Birdie in ""The Little Foxes"", she made one of her last theater appearances in the difficult role of the mother in ""The Effect of Gamma Rays on ""Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds"" in 1971.Betty suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage in Hyannis, Massachusetts in 1973, just as she was about to leave and film The Day of the Locust (1975). Cast in the flashy role of ""Big Sister"", an evangelist, her part was taken over by Geraldine Page. At age 57, Hollywood lost a somewhat undervalued talent who enjoyed the work more than the stardom that often accompanied it.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net          Spouse (3)               Raymond Olivere          (22 March\xa01968            - 13 September\xa01973)\xa0(her death)                         Edwin J.

I recently saw a tribute to Marilyn Monroe and it was mentioned that
Marilyn called ""Bus Stop"" her favorite film in which she acted. She
thought she did her best work in that film and it legitimized her as a
serious actress. This was one of the few films of hers I had never seen
so I was very anxious now to see this, especially on widescreen. Well,
it was disappointing: not because of Marilyn - she was fine - but the
story was incredibly stupid.<br><br>Part of the problem might be the way our society has changed, although
I doubt even 50 years ago - when this film came out - a guy could do
what ""Bo Decker"" (Don Murray) did in here and get away with it.
Nonetheless, to watch this brainless idiot - in a crowded nightclub -
chase a woman down, rip off half of her dress, break into her dressing
room, follow her out the window to a bus station, lasso her and kidnap
her by dragging her onto the bus.....and have NOBODY even attempt to
stop him during all of this (and more) is a real insult to any viewer's
intelligence. No police? No security? No harassment, et al? <br><br>The story, like Murray's character who has fewer brains than the rodeo
animals he's battling, is just plain dumb. Monroe (""Cheri"") and friend
Eileen Heckart (""Vera"") are fine, as is the other main character,
""Virgil"" (Arthur O'Connell) but Murray is so loud, abrasive and stupid
that he ruins the movie. He - not Monroe - dominates the film,
unfortunately.<br><br>Thankfully, Monroe is.....well, Monroe, so all is not lost watching
this movie but this screenplay is so dated and so moronic you'll cringe
watching the film.

While I'm in agreement with the consensus view on Bus Stop that it is
one of the better films with Marilyn Monroe, and I like Monroe as much
as the next classic film fan, or as much as the next guy with
overactive hormones, I've noticed a relative downplaying of Don
Murray's work in the film--often critics outright dismiss him,
characterizing Bus Stop as a film that works ""despite Murray's
character and performance"". I couldn't disagree with that more
strongly. Not to detract from Monroe, but what really pushed Bus Stop
over the top for me in terms of quality--in addition to the fine,
allegorical story--was the hilariously over-the-top performance of
Murray and the sheer absurdity of his character.<br><br>But maybe my different view on this, and why I love the film so much,
is because I'm a huge fan of absurdism. Bus Stop is the tale of
Beauregard ""Bo"" Decker (Murray) and Virgil Blessing (Arthur O'Connell).
They're headed from their ranch in Montana to Phoenix, Arizona to
participate in a rodeo. Bo is quite skilled at ridin' and rustlin', so
Virgil is taking him ""off of the farm"" for one of the only times in his
life to give the rodeo a shot, and more importantly, to get him a bit
more worldly experience, especially with women. Bo's experience with
the fairer sex had been pretty much limited to pictures in magazines.
Virgil seems to just want Bo to lose a bit of his innocence, but Bo has
in his mind that he's going to find ""an angel"" and take possession of
her. Because he's only been on a ranch, that's the only way he knows
how to relate to anything. He figures once he finds an angel he'll just
rope her up like a calf and take her home. As we see from the beginning
of the film, Bo has a tendency to be brash and yell at everyone, like
he's hollerin' instructions across the range at his partner before they
lose control of their cattle.<br><br>Enter Monroe as showgirl ""Cherie"". She's a hillbilly (heck, we learn
that she even almost married her cousin) from Arkansas whose made it as
far as Arizona, where she's playing a dive girlie club in Phoenix,
trying to earn enough money and gumption to one day make it to L.A.
Once Bo sees her, he decides she's his angel. Needless to say, that
doesn't go over so well.<br><br>The bulk of the film consists of Bo trying to ride everything in the
world like a bucking bronco while others, including Cherie, try to
figure out what's wrong with him. For me, this material was
gut-bustingly funny. I had to hit pause on the DVD player a number of
times because I was laughing so hard.<br><br>This is not to say that Monroe doesn't turn in a great, nuanced
performance--she does, despite the reported difficulties filming her.
According to scriptwriter George Axelrod, she would repeatedly break
out in tears, become extremely frustrated, forget her lines, yell
profanities, and director Joshua Logan couldn't call ""cut"" during her
scenes or she'd take it as a personal affront, so Logan would let 900
feet of film just run out while he talked to her, coaxing a performance
out of her. And it's not to say that Monroe and Murray do not have
chemistry together--they do; if they hadn't, the film wouldn't have
worked.<br><br>But without Murray's bizarre but funny character, which he plays to a
tee, I'm not sure I would have thought Bus Stop was a 10. In fact,
there was one section where I felt that score might be in
jeopardy--during the latter part of the relatively quiet climax set in
Grace's Diner/Bus Stop, when Murray tones down a bit. The film is still
good at that point--still definitely a 9, but I found myself slightly
missing the hyperactive comedy of the earlier scenes.<br><br>The story for Bus Stop was originally a one-act play by William Inge
called People in the Wind. Inge later adapted People in the Wind for a
larger scale production on Broadway, now retitled Bus Stop. It opened
at the Music Box Theater in New York City on March 2, 1955 and ran for
478 performances. It was quickly adapted for film by Axelrod, who
changed the play quite a bit, including dropping major characters.<br><br>The cinematography in the film is lush, and evidences that we're still
in the early days of the anamorphic widescreen process known as
Cinemascope. Logan makes use of some broad landscapes and wide shots of
the rodeo, crowd and such, but the best uses of widescreen in the film
are subtler. Probably the best shot arrives in that ""quiet"" section
mentioned above, when Cherie has her head on Grace's bar, her torso
stretched horizontally. Bo ends up putting his head on top of hers,
aligning his body similarly, and together they fill the screen,
naturally conforming to the aspect ratio. Logan's direction is great
throughout, both for camera work and his actor's performances.<br><br>As for Monroe, perhaps reflecting (barely) offscreen problems at the
time, she easily paints a complex, almost tortured soul. Her
performance underscores one of the main subtexts of the
film--loneliness accompanied by a kind of melancholy hope. Every
character who has more than a couple lines is experiencing this in some
way--even Bo, who is covering it up with his boisterousness. Logan and
Axelrod also emphasize ironies--one beautiful instance is when Bo
announces Cherie as his angel while she's singing ""That Old Black
Magic"" in a very suggestive costume. And there are nice, unrealized (by
the characters) parallels in their quests--in their loneliness and
hope, they're really all looking for their own angels, often not
recognizing when they're right in front of them.

Marilyn Monroe is so good here it's startling. Her Cherie (with the accent
on the first syllable, remember) is one of the most lovable characters in
the history of film. That the rest of the movie is rocky-going and her
co-star is no match for her is unfortunate, but not fatal.<br><br>Apparently the director, Joshua Logan, was able to create a relatively
peaceful environment where Monroe could completely ""let go"" and allow her
natural fragility and sex appeal to take over. When she's on screen it's
impossible to take your eyes off her, not just because she's beautiful (what
starlet from the 1950's WASN'T beautiful?) but because she's laying bare her
character's soul for the camera (and in the process much of her own soul as
well). She isn't just reading lines with various inflections or doing bits
of business like so many actors do, she's bringing the character to life.<br><br>Unforgettable is the moment where she finds herself perched on the shoulder
of the crazy, lovestruck cowboy watching a parade and she's trying to
pantomime to a friend in the crowd how she wound up up there. Or the way she
keeps ""shushing"" the loud-talking bus driver so that he won't wake up the
sleeping cowboy as she's planning her escape. Or the way she can't make eye
contact or get her lazy backwoods accent (that is incredibly charming) to
sound firm enough when she keeps trying to tell the cowboy to get lost. Her
comic timing is just sublime and unteachable. <br><br>Don Murray's performance as the cowboy, criminally and inexplicably
Oscar-nominated, is cloying, two-dimensional and geared for the stage, not
the intimacy of film. He needs to provide some hint of vulnerabilty before
he's humbled in the fist fight with the bus driver, but he is tragically not
up to the task. His Beauregard is the kind of loud-mouthed, uncouth buffoon
that only a greatly skilled comic actor can make sympathetic, and Murray
simply doesn't know how to finesse the comic moments and make them work.<br><br>Monroe receives fine support from Arthur O'Connell as Beau's older, wiser
friend Virgil Blessing, but this is her show all the way. She makes it a
good movie, but one can't help imagining how much better it could have been
had it been directed by someone like Kazan and co-starred possibly Rock
Hudson.

Bus Stop has been rightly hailed as Marilyn Monroe's breakthrough
performance in a movie as a serious dramatic actress. She is absolutely
superb here, ditching the breathless dumb blonde of earlier roles and
playing a hardened, Southern chanteuse in search of true love. She
manages to convey a whole range of emotions which is testament to her
time spent at Lee Strasberg's Actor's Studio in New York. As usual she
sparkles and it's difficult to take your eyes off her, but there is a
depth and sympathy to her playing that makes you take note of the
performance and not simply the curves.<br><br>However, Bus Stop is a relatively simple picture of unrequited then
requited love. The comedy moments don't often work that well and Don
Murray's Beau has to be one of the most irritating characters I have
ever seen in a film. Him and Cherie coming together at the end of the
picture is unbelievable and spoiled the movie for me...I always wanted
her to get away!<br><br>Bus Stop is more enjoyable from the Monroe point of view as her playing
is spellbinding and marked a turning point in her career.

The movie is based on a play that I haven't read so maybe I'm missing
some of the subtext but as pure entertainment I wouldn't recommend this
movie. The characters aren't well-defined and are little more than
stereotypes, e.g. Grace, the sassy diner waitress, Cherie, the showgirl
with a heart of gold. Marilyn Monroe plays the same type of character
that she more or less played for her entire career, but she does it
very well; she and Hope Lange provide the only good performances. Don
Murray's unsophisticated cowboy was so obnoxious he practically ruined
any enjoyment to be had from the movie. The supporting players are
decent but that's all. It's a shame, this movie could have been pretty
good if they had made one or two different casting decisions.

I watched this yesterday and I'm still in shock. Monroe began to ripen
as a dramatic actress just mere days (it seems) before she died. For
sheer hilarity and dramatic weight, she never surpassed her role in
""Some like it hot"". For dramatic power she was very impressive and
powerful in ""The Misfits"". This film, earlier in her career has been
hailed as an early dramatic performance.<br><br>I am not familiar with the play from whence this film came from. I just
watched it and took it for what it appeared. I found Don Murray's
characterization of the cowboy to be a negative distraction, largely
because instead of a real person he came across as a living comic-book
character. There was not a moment when he was on the screen except for
his quiet moments of remorse at the end, when he was not sounding like
a lunatic. Other commentators have noted that this over the top
performance was supposed to be this way, deliberately to be funny.
Well, in my time, at the end of 2006, this type of behavior looks
stupid, ridiculous and unbelievable. Further, Murray spends almost
every second in the film shouting at the top of his lungs as if this is
the way most cowboys fresh off the farm act when hitting the big city
for the first time. Ahhhhh, no: I don't think so. The director (Logan)
must have encouraged him to act this way and for me it makes him look
like an imbecile. Honestly, his acting just made me so uncomfortable
from the beginning to the end I wish I could have stopped the film.<br><br>Then we have Monroe. She looked as she always does, beautiful. But, I
did notice that she kept changing the inflection of her voice, as if
not quite yet sure of how to morph from a blonde-bombshell-dimwit into
a real person, a dramatic presence. She just comes in and out of the
""place"" and it strikes me now as quite a fascinating moment in her
career, almost at the cusp of breaking out into better acting. Her
attempts at an accent come and go and if we were not so distracted by
what she looked like we'd take closer note of it. Her skin looked so
white next to the cowboy that she almost looked sickly. The best
moments were when she was staring into a mirror (very well set up shot)
and the doubts and fears that crossed her face felt every bit as real
as one could imagine.<br><br>All in all I was shocked at how bad the film looked, given the age in
which we live. The cartoonish characterization that Murray gives just
looks ridiculous and hence hard to relate to. I just could not imagine
any cowboy acting like a wild baboon on steroids. Sorry, but this just
made me cringe. You compare a great dramatic effort like ""The Misfits""
and the contrast makes everything clear. If Joshua Logan wanted to make
a drama here then he destroyed it with the creation of a character
right out of the comic ""Bizarro"". This film just does not age well.

""Bus Stop"" is named for the setting of the last half-hour of this film, the
bus stop in the snow, somewhere in Wyoming, where Beau finally gets his
'comeuppance', right before he and Cherie reconcile.  If this movie had not
been made in 1956, but instead in modern times, it would have received a
very laughable reception. As it is, I consider it a cult classic in the
genre of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", so horrible and fake are the
characters and the dialog. <br><br>However, Marilyn Monroe, in her 26th film, playing a simple showgirl from
Arkansas, does very well with her role. Don Murray as ""Beau"", in his very
first film, is so obnoxious that by the time he apologises for his bad
behavior, we no longer care about him, and ""Cherie's"" accepting him just
doesn't make sense. Hope Lange has a small part as ""Elma"" on the bus, in
this her first film. She and Murray married afterward in real life, but it
didn't last. Murray made a number of other films, including the father in
""Quarterback Princess"" in 1983 with Helen Hunt.<br><br>The reason to see this film is Marilyn Monroe in her prime, almost 30, and
only 6 years from her death. The story, of the possessive cowboy who decides
to marry Cherie and haul her away to his ranch in Montana, is pretty simple
and pretty implausible. The scene in the bus stop, where he finally kisses
her ""for serious"", was also featured in an episode of Northern Exposure,
with Chris playing Beau and Maggie playing Cherie, for a community theater
production they were rehearsing for.

...is the ""corn"" factor in this at times embarrassingly bad Marilyn
Monroe feature. I like to cut Norma Jean a fair bit of slack on the
subject of her acting ability and will go a little out of my way to
watch some of her lesser-known movies when they air on the schedules
but I found this country bumpkin nonsense almost toe-curlingly
unwatchable.<br><br>I'm struggling really hard to think of any redeeming features but I
find I can't. The story is lighter-than-fluff fluff and one you'd more
likely see fleshed out from near-nothingness in a musical of the era.
Unfortunately some of the hokiest hillbilly music you'll ever hear does
make something of an intrusion into the story and I'm sorry but I find
old-style country and western music as harmonious as a nail-scratched
blackboard.<br><br>Monroe looks fine if a little shop-worn at times, gives us a variety of
accents from most of the mid-western states and is required at various
times to dress herself in a mildly prurient way in a way that no other
major Hollywood star of the era would or should have to. However her
co-star, ""introducing"" Don Murray (how I wish he'd been introduced to
oblivion!) gives the most lunk-headedly irritating performance I think
I've ever seen as a hayseed country boy who gets the hots for Monroe's
down-at-heel showgirl with plenty, in fact, far too much a-whooping and
a-hollering for normal patience to bear. I see to my horror that Murray
inexplicably got an Oscar nomination for his I hesitate to call it
acting which must surely have given hope to every non-actor of the day!<br><br>The direction is almost as dumb and the dialogue dumber again, - I defy
anyone to not laugh out loud at Murray and Monroe's big ""at long last
love"" scene where their faces fill the screen and unfortunately the
world's worst dialogue simultaneously fills your ears.<br><br>I guess the producer and director were seeking to cash in on Marilyn's
ascending star with a light-hearted country-style romantic comedy but
really do yourself a favour and give this particular bus the widest

'Bus Stop' is a cheerful and romantic old-style film with part of the
action centering around a bus stop and bus journey. Bo, a
not-very-bright cowboy, does not know anything about love but has his
heart set on bringing a woman back home with him. He sees Cherie
(played by Monroe) at a bar and falls instantly in love, but she does
not quite feel the same way about him. The film explores this romance
and the lessons that Bo (and Cherie) has to learn in order to 'grow
up'. It takes him several mistakes and character flaws to overcome,
but, with the help of Marilyn Monroe, everything comes to a happy (and
quick) ending, like most 1950s films.<br><br>Overall, 'Bus Stop' is an engaging and funny film and it is worth a
watch. However, there are some problems. One of the problems is that I
found Bo to be extremely annoying in places. He is too 'in your face';
I am not sure whether Bo's innocence was over-played by the actor or if
it was written in the script. The other problem I had was the ending.
Older films typically have a rushed ending, at least when compared to
the present day. It just seems to abrupt.<br><br>The film also has some amuzing adult humor, and this is subtle so there
is not a chance of a child picking up on it. (Look at the float in the
parade!) Overall, 'Bus Stop' is an all-around enjoyable tale about an
age past.

Alternately puzzled, lost, desperate, lonely, confused and unexpectedly
radiant with happiness, Marilyn Monroe, with a mixture of humor and
pain scores her greatest triumph in Joshua Logan's ""Bus Stop"" creating
a complete and deeply touching character...<br><br>Singing 'That Old Black Magic' to a noisy crowd of cowpokes who
couldn't care less about her efforts to entertain them, Cherie is
pleased to discover a fan in Bo, a young and innocent cowboy who has
come to make his fortune at the Rodeo and finds himself an Angel to
take back to his Montana ranch...The kiss she gives him in
appreciation, determines him then and there to be his beloved wife...<br><br>Logan gives Don Murray his first and best-remembered screen role, as
the gauche simple-thinking cowboy who romances the glamorous
'chantoose'... Marilyn succeeds in making him say ""please"" which is the
point of the whole thing... Murray was Oscar-nominated for his
performance...<br><br>There are other fine performances in the movie: Arthur O'Connell,
delightful as the cowboy's pal who big-brothers him with loving
patience; Eileen Heckart amusing as the old time friend; Betty Field,
strong enough as the bus stop owner; Robert Bray, firm as the driver of
the bus and Hope Lange, so auspicious in her screen debut whom Cherie
reveals details of her past...<br><br>With a modern Western background and rodeo atmosphere, and with
panoramic long shot and overwhelming close-ups in color and
CinemaScope, ""Bus Stop"" is a comedy-drama very well done, and a modest
entertainment in familiar American vein...<br><br>The film had one of Monroe's most touching songs: 'That Old Black
Magic' was as funny as it was heartbreaking

I recently saw a tribute to Marilyn Monroe and it was mentioned that
Marilyn called ""Bus Stop"" her favorite film in which she acted. She
thought she did her best work in that film and it legitimized her as a
serious actress. This was one of the few films of hers I had never seen
so I was very anxious now to see this, especially on widescreen. Well,
it was disappointing: not because of Marilyn - she was fine - but the
story was incredibly stupid.<br><br>Part of the problem might be the way our society has changed, although
I doubt even 50 years ago - when this film came out - a guy could do
what ""Bo Decker"" (Don Murray) did in here and get away with it.
Nonetheless, to watch this brainless idiot - in a crowded nightclub -
chase a woman down, rip off half of her dress, break into her dressing
room, follow her out the window to a bus station, lasso her and kidnap
her by dragging her onto the bus.....and have NOBODY even attempt to
stop him during all of this (and more) is a real insult to any viewer's
intelligence. No police? No security? No harassment, et al? <br><br>The story, like Murray's character who has fewer brains than the rodeo
animals he's battling, is just plain dumb. Monroe (""Cheri"") and friend
Eileen Heckart (""Vera"") are fine, as is the other main character,
""Virgil"" (Arthur O'Connell) but Murray is so loud, abrasive and stupid
that he ruins the movie. He - not Monroe - dominates the film,
unfortunately.<br><br>Thankfully, Monroe is.....well, Monroe, so all is not lost watching
this movie but this screenplay is so dated and so moronic you'll cringe
watching the film.

While I'm in agreement with the consensus view on Bus Stop that it is
one of the better films with Marilyn Monroe, and I like Monroe as much
as the next classic film fan, or as much as the next guy with
overactive hormones, I've noticed a relative downplaying of Don
Murray's work in the film--often critics outright dismiss him,
characterizing Bus Stop as a film that works ""despite Murray's
character and performance"". I couldn't disagree with that more
strongly. Not to detract from Monroe, but what really pushed Bus Stop
over the top for me in terms of quality--in addition to the fine,
allegorical story--was the hilariously over-the-top performance of
Murray and the sheer absurdity of his character.<br><br>But maybe my different view on this, and why I love the film so much,
is because I'm a huge fan of absurdism. Bus Stop is the tale of
Beauregard ""Bo"" Decker (Murray) and Virgil Blessing (Arthur O'Connell).
They're headed from their ranch in Montana to Phoenix, Arizona to
participate in a rodeo. Bo is quite skilled at ridin' and rustlin', so
Virgil is taking him ""off of the farm"" for one of the only times in his
life to give the rodeo a shot, and more importantly, to get him a bit
more worldly experience, especially with women. Bo's experience with
the fairer sex had been pretty much limited to pictures in magazines.
Virgil seems to just want Bo to lose a bit of his innocence, but Bo has
in his mind that he's going to find ""an angel"" and take possession of
her. Because he's only been on a ranch, that's the only way he knows
how to relate to anything. He figures once he finds an angel he'll just
rope her up like a calf and take her home. As we see from the beginning
of the film, Bo has a tendency to be brash and yell at everyone, like
he's hollerin' instructions across the range at his partner before they
lose control of their cattle.<br><br>Enter Monroe as showgirl ""Cherie"". She's a hillbilly (heck, we learn
that she even almost married her cousin) from Arkansas whose made it as
far as Arizona, where she's playing a dive girlie club in Phoenix,
trying to earn enough money and gumption to one day make it to L.A.
Once Bo sees her, he decides she's his angel. Needless to say, that
doesn't go over so well.<br><br>The bulk of the film consists of Bo trying to ride everything in the
world like a bucking bronco while others, including Cherie, try to
figure out what's wrong with him. For me, this material was
gut-bustingly funny. I had to hit pause on the DVD player a number of
times because I was laughing so hard.<br><br>This is not to say that Monroe doesn't turn in a great, nuanced
performance--she does, despite the reported difficulties filming her.
According to scriptwriter George Axelrod, she would repeatedly break
out in tears, become extremely frustrated, forget her lines, yell
profanities, and director Joshua Logan couldn't call ""cut"" during her
scenes or she'd take it as a personal affront, so Logan would let 900
feet of film just run out while he talked to her, coaxing a performance
out of her. And it's not to say that Monroe and Murray do not have
chemistry together--they do; if they hadn't, the film wouldn't have
worked.<br><br>But without Murray's bizarre but funny character, which he plays to a
tee, I'm not sure I would have thought Bus Stop was a 10. In fact,
there was one section where I felt that score might be in
jeopardy--during the latter part of the relatively quiet climax set in
Grace's Diner/Bus Stop, when Murray tones down a bit. The film is still
good at that point--still definitely a 9, but I found myself slightly
missing the hyperactive comedy of the earlier scenes.<br><br>The story for Bus Stop was originally a one-act play by William Inge
called People in the Wind. Inge later adapted People in the Wind for a
larger scale production on Broadway, now retitled Bus Stop. It opened
at the Music Box Theater in New York City on March 2, 1955 and ran for
478 performances. It was quickly adapted for film by Axelrod, who
changed the play quite a bit, including dropping major characters.<br><br>The cinematography in the film is lush, and evidences that we're still
in the early days of the anamorphic widescreen process known as
Cinemascope. Logan makes use of some broad landscapes and wide shots of
the rodeo, crowd and such, but the best uses of widescreen in the film
are subtler. Probably the best shot arrives in that ""quiet"" section
mentioned above, when Cherie has her head on Grace's bar, her torso
stretched horizontally. Bo ends up putting his head on top of hers,
aligning his body similarly, and together they fill the screen,
naturally conforming to the aspect ratio. Logan's direction is great
throughout, both for camera work and his actor's performances.<br><br>As for Monroe, perhaps reflecting (barely) offscreen problems at the
time, she easily paints a complex, almost tortured soul. Her
performance underscores one of the main subtexts of the
film--loneliness accompanied by a kind of melancholy hope. Every
character who has more than a couple lines is experiencing this in some
way--even Bo, who is covering it up with his boisterousness. Logan and
Axelrod also emphasize ironies--one beautiful instance is when Bo
announces Cherie as his angel while she's singing ""That Old Black
Magic"" in a very suggestive costume. And there are nice, unrealized (by
the characters) parallels in their quests--in their loneliness and
hope, they're really all looking for their own angels, often not
recognizing when they're right in front of them.

Marilyn Monroe is so good here it's startling. Her Cherie (with the accent
on the first syllable, remember) is one of the most lovable characters in
the history of film. That the rest of the movie is rocky-going and her
co-star is no match for her is unfortunate, but not fatal.<br><br>Apparently the director, Joshua Logan, was able to create a relatively
peaceful environment where Monroe could completely ""let go"" and allow her
natural fragility and sex appeal to take over. When she's on screen it's
impossible to take your eyes off her, not just because she's beautiful (what
starlet from the 1950's WASN'T beautiful?) but because she's laying bare her
character's soul for the camera (and in the process much of her own soul as
well). She isn't just reading lines with various inflections or doing bits
of business like so many actors do, she's bringing the character to life.<br><br>Unforgettable is the moment where she finds herself perched on the shoulder
of the crazy, lovestruck cowboy watching a parade and she's trying to
pantomime to a friend in the crowd how she wound up up there. Or the way she
keeps ""shushing"" the loud-talking bus driver so that he won't wake up the
sleeping cowboy as she's planning her escape. Or the way she can't make eye
contact or get her lazy backwoods accent (that is incredibly charming) to
sound firm enough when she keeps trying to tell the cowboy to get lost. Her
comic timing is just sublime and unteachable. <br><br>Don Murray's performance as the cowboy, criminally and inexplicably
Oscar-nominated, is cloying, two-dimensional and geared for the stage, not
the intimacy of film. He needs to provide some hint of vulnerabilty before
he's humbled in the fist fight with the bus driver, but he is tragically not
up to the task. His Beauregard is the kind of loud-mouthed, uncouth buffoon
that only a greatly skilled comic actor can make sympathetic, and Murray
simply doesn't know how to finesse the comic moments and make them work.<br><br>Monroe receives fine support from Arthur O'Connell as Beau's older, wiser
friend Virgil Blessing, but this is her show all the way. She makes it a
good movie, but one can't help imagining how much better it could have been
had it been directed by someone like Kazan and co-starred possibly Rock
Hudson.

Bus Stop has been rightly hailed as Marilyn Monroe's breakthrough
performance in a movie as a serious dramatic actress. She is absolutely
superb here, ditching the breathless dumb blonde of earlier roles and
playing a hardened, Southern chanteuse in search of true love. She
manages to convey a whole range of emotions which is testament to her
time spent at Lee Strasberg's Actor's Studio in New York. As usual she
sparkles and it's difficult to take your eyes off her, but there is a
depth and sympathy to her playing that makes you take note of the
performance and not simply the curves.<br><br>However, Bus Stop is a relatively simple picture of unrequited then
requited love. The comedy moments don't often work that well and Don
Murray's Beau has to be one of the most irritating characters I have
ever seen in a film. Him and Cherie coming together at the end of the
picture is unbelievable and spoiled the movie for me...I always wanted
her to get away!<br><br>Bus Stop is more enjoyable from the Monroe point of view as her playing
is spellbinding and marked a turning point in her career.

The movie is based on a play that I haven't read so maybe I'm missing
some of the subtext but as pure entertainment I wouldn't recommend this
movie. The characters aren't well-defined and are little more than
stereotypes, e.g. Grace, the sassy diner waitress, Cherie, the showgirl
with a heart of gold. Marilyn Monroe plays the same type of character
that she more or less played for her entire career, but she does it
very well; she and Hope Lange provide the only good performances. Don
Murray's unsophisticated cowboy was so obnoxious he practically ruined
any enjoyment to be had from the movie. The supporting players are
decent but that's all. It's a shame, this movie could have been pretty
good if they had made one or two different casting decisions.

I watched this yesterday and I'm still in shock. Monroe began to ripen
as a dramatic actress just mere days (it seems) before she died. For
sheer hilarity and dramatic weight, she never surpassed her role in
""Some like it hot"". For dramatic power she was very impressive and
powerful in ""The Misfits"". This film, earlier in her career has been
hailed as an early dramatic performance.<br><br>I am not familiar with the play from whence this film came from. I just
watched it and took it for what it appeared. I found Don Murray's
characterization of the cowboy to be a negative distraction, largely
because instead of a real person he came across as a living comic-book
character. There was not a moment when he was on the screen except for
his quiet moments of remorse at the end, when he was not sounding like
a lunatic. Other commentators have noted that this over the top
performance was supposed to be this way, deliberately to be funny.
Well, in my time, at the end of 2006, this type of behavior looks
stupid, ridiculous and unbelievable. Further, Murray spends almost
every second in the film shouting at the top of his lungs as if this is
the way most cowboys fresh off the farm act when hitting the big city
for the first time. Ahhhhh, no: I don't think so. The director (Logan)
must have encouraged him to act this way and for me it makes him look
like an imbecile. Honestly, his acting just made me so uncomfortable
from the beginning to the end I wish I could have stopped the film.<br><br>Then we have Monroe. She looked as she always does, beautiful. But, I
did notice that she kept changing the inflection of her voice, as if
not quite yet sure of how to morph from a blonde-bombshell-dimwit into
a real person, a dramatic presence. She just comes in and out of the
""place"" and it strikes me now as quite a fascinating moment in her
career, almost at the cusp of breaking out into better acting. Her
attempts at an accent come and go and if we were not so distracted by
what she looked like we'd take closer note of it. Her skin looked so
white next to the cowboy that she almost looked sickly. The best
moments were when she was staring into a mirror (very well set up shot)
and the doubts and fears that crossed her face felt every bit as real
as one could imagine.<br><br>All in all I was shocked at how bad the film looked, given the age in
which we live. The cartoonish characterization that Murray gives just
looks ridiculous and hence hard to relate to. I just could not imagine
any cowboy acting like a wild baboon on steroids. Sorry, but this just
made me cringe. You compare a great dramatic effort like ""The Misfits""
and the contrast makes everything clear. If Joshua Logan wanted to make
a drama here then he destroyed it with the creation of a character
right out of the comic ""Bizarro"". This film just does not age well.

""Bus Stop"" is named for the setting of the last half-hour of this film, the
bus stop in the snow, somewhere in Wyoming, where Beau finally gets his
'comeuppance', right before he and Cherie reconcile.  If this movie had not
been made in 1956, but instead in modern times, it would have received a
very laughable reception. As it is, I consider it a cult classic in the
genre of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", so horrible and fake are the
characters and the dialog. <br><br>However, Marilyn Monroe, in her 26th film, playing a simple showgirl from
Arkansas, does very well with her role. Don Murray as ""Beau"", in his very
first film, is so obnoxious that by the time he apologises for his bad
behavior, we no longer care about him, and ""Cherie's"" accepting him just
doesn't make sense. Hope Lange has a small part as ""Elma"" on the bus, in
this her first film. She and Murray married afterward in real life, but it
didn't last. Murray made a number of other films, including the father in
""Quarterback Princess"" in 1983 with Helen Hunt.<br><br>The reason to see this film is Marilyn Monroe in her prime, almost 30, and
only 6 years from her death. The story, of the possessive cowboy who decides
to marry Cherie and haul her away to his ranch in Montana, is pretty simple
and pretty implausible. The scene in the bus stop, where he finally kisses
her ""for serious"", was also featured in an episode of Northern Exposure,
with Chris playing Beau and Maggie playing Cherie, for a community theater
production they were rehearsing for.

...is the ""corn"" factor in this at times embarrassingly bad Marilyn
Monroe feature. I like to cut Norma Jean a fair bit of slack on the
subject of her acting ability and will go a little out of my way to
watch some of her lesser-known movies when they air on the schedules
but I found this country bumpkin nonsense almost toe-curlingly
unwatchable.<br><br>I'm struggling really hard to think of any redeeming features but I
find I can't. The story is lighter-than-fluff fluff and one you'd more
likely see fleshed out from near-nothingness in a musical of the era.
Unfortunately some of the hokiest hillbilly music you'll ever hear does
make something of an intrusion into the story and I'm sorry but I find
old-style country and western music as harmonious as a nail-scratched
blackboard.<br><br>Monroe looks fine if a little shop-worn at times, gives us a variety of
accents from most of the mid-western states and is required at various
times to dress herself in a mildly prurient way in a way that no other
major Hollywood star of the era would or should have to. However her
co-star, ""introducing"" Don Murray (how I wish he'd been introduced to
oblivion!) gives the most lunk-headedly irritating performance I think
I've ever seen as a hayseed country boy who gets the hots for Monroe's
down-at-heel showgirl with plenty, in fact, far too much a-whooping and
a-hollering for normal patience to bear. I see to my horror that Murray
inexplicably got an Oscar nomination for his I hesitate to call it
acting which must surely have given hope to every non-actor of the day!<br><br>The direction is almost as dumb and the dialogue dumber again, - I defy
anyone to not laugh out loud at Murray and Monroe's big ""at long last
love"" scene where their faces fill the screen and unfortunately the
world's worst dialogue simultaneously fills your ears.<br><br>I guess the producer and director were seeking to cash in on Marilyn's
ascending star with a light-hearted country-style romantic comedy but
really do yourself a favour and give this particular bus the widest
possible berth and wait for the next one, no matter how long it takes

His family moved to Santa Monica, California when he was eight years old. His acting career began with plays at high school, followed by acting in West Coast, a traveling theater company.Ford was discovered in 1939 by Tom Moore, a talent scout for 20th Century Fox. He subsequently signed a contract with Columbia Pictures the same year. Ford\'s contract with Columbia marked a significant departure in that studio\'s successful business model. Columbia\'s boss, Harry Cohn, had spent decades observing other studios\'-most notably Warner Brothers-troubles with their contract stars and had built his poverty-row studio around their loan-outs. Basically, major studios would use Columbia as a penalty box for unruly behavior-usually salary demands or work refusals. The cunning Cohn usually assigned these stars (his little studio could not normally afford then) into pictures, and the studio\'s status rose immensely as the 1930s progressed. Understandably, Cohn had long resisted developing his own stable of contract stars (he\'d first hired Peter Lorre in 1934 but didn\'t know what to do with him) but had relented in the late 1930s, first adding Rosalind Russell, then signing Ford and fellow newcomer William Holden. Cohn reasoned that the two prospects could be used interchangeably, should one become troublesome. Although often competing for the same parts, Ford and Holden became good friends. Their careers would roughly parallel each other through the 1940s, until Holden became a superstar through his remarkable association with director Billy Wilder in the 1950s.Ford made his official debut in Fox\'s Heaven with a Barbed Wire Fence (1939), and continued working in various small roles throughout the 1940s until his movie career was interrupted to join the Marines in World War II. Ford continued his military career in the Naval Reserve well into the Vietnam War, achieving the rank of captain. In 1943 Ford married legendary tap dancer Eleanor Powell, and had one son, Peter Ford. Like many actors returning to Hollywood after the war (including James Stewart and Holden (who had already acquired a serious alcohol problem), he found it initially difficult to regain his career momentum. He was able to resume his movie career with the help of Bette Davis, who gave him his first postwar break in the 1946 movie A Stolen Life (1946). However, it was not until his acclaimed performance in a 1946 classic film noir, Gilda (1946), with Rita Hayworth, that he became a major star and one of the the most popular actors of his time. He scored big with the film noir classics The Big Heat (1953) and Blackboard Jungle (1955), and was usually been cast as a calm and collected everyday-hero, showing courage under pressure. Ford continued to make many notable films during his prestigious 50-year movie career, but he is best known for his fine westerns such as 3:10 to Yuma (1957) and The Rounders (1965). Ford pulled a hugely entertaining turn in The Sheepman (1958) and many more fine films. In the 1970s, Ford made his television debut in the controversial The Brotherhood of the Bell (1970) and appeared in two fondly remembered television series: Cade\'s County (1971) and The Family Holvak (1975). During the 1980s and 1990s, Ford limited his appearance to documentaries and occasional films, including a nice cameo in Superman (1978).Glenn Ford is remembered fondly by his fans for his more than 100 excellent films and his charismatic silver screen presence.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Mattias Thuresson <mattias.thuresson@mbox300.swipnet.se>          Spouse (4)               Jeanne Baus          (5 March\xa01993            - 1994)\xa0(divorced)           Cynthia Ford (10 September\xa01977            - 13 September\xa01984)\xa0(divorced)           Kathryn Hays (27 March\xa01966            - 26 June\xa01969)\xa0(divorced)           Eleanor Powell (23 October\xa01943            - 23 November\xa01959)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)          Trade Mark (3)        Western cowboy roles        Soft-spoken commanding voice with light Canadian accent        Ladies\' manTrivia (38)      Glenn appeared in 5 movies with classic leading actress, Rita Hayworth: Affair in Trinidad (1952), The Lady in Question (1940), The Loves of Carmen (1948), The Money Trap (1965) and Gilda (1946).

The story was to be about a Binghamton, New York courthouse clerk, who finds herself falling in love with a beautiful liar who is accused of armed robbery as well as a hit and run charge involving a death. The cast was to have included Laraine Day, Fred MacMurray, Yvonne De Carlo, Hugh Beaumont, Glenn Ford, Howard Duff, and Evelyn Keyes, with the studio wanting to shoot on location in Binghamton and neighboring Johnson City. The project never materialized because the plot was considered too much of a generic step-up of Double Indemnity (1944), plus the studio never received a reply via phone or standard mail, from the Binghamton Courthouse, or from then Mayor Donald Kramer, granting permission to film on location in the area, and to negotiate a fair range of payment. Based on that neglect, the studio canceled the project and moved on.      Proposed to his 3rd wife, Cynthia Ford (nee Cynthia Howard), at Windsor Castle in England in August 1977.      In support of President Lyndon Johnson\'s escalation of the Vietnam War, Ford traveled with a combat camera crew from the demilitarized zone south to the Mekong Delta.Personal Quotes (16)      When I\'m on camera, I have to do things pretty much the way I do things in everyday life. It gives the audience someone real to identify with.      People laugh when I say I\'m not an actor, but I\'m not, I play myself.      The Western is a man\'s world and I love it.      I\'ve never played anyone but myself on screen.      If they tried to rush me, I\'d always say I\'ve only got one other speed, and it\'s slower.      ""Let\'s never forget that to remain free we must always be strong. That\'s an important lesson I learned in my Navy career in World War II. National defense must be the top priority for our country. If you are strong, you are safe. Now is the time for every American to be proud. This is the land of the free and the home of the brave. If we are not brave, we will not be free."" (2004)      ""Never give up. Take what life throws at you and throw it right back. If life keeps throwing then you have a tennis match going. Learn to like tennis."" (2002)Ronald Reagan was a true friend and an American Patriot. We are proud of him and his service to the country. We need men like him today.      [In westerns] you don\'t have to speak English to understand what\'s going on. I\'ve always said the talking pictures talk too much anyway.      I\'m out of place doing sophistication. I\'m so uncomfortable in a tuxedo.      When I see films that go on and on with dialogue, I feel like telling the actors, ""Be quiet! Let the audience do some of the work!"" (from a 1975 interview with Bob Thomas, Canadian Press)      Some actors count their lines as soon as they receive a script. I\'m the opposite. I try to see how many lines I can whittle down...You can say just as much in 4 as you can in 14.      Hell, no actor is going to tell Frank Capra how to make a picture. He has forgotten more about movie-making than most directors ever know.      Americans playing Shakespeare are really ridiculous.      Asked how he wished to be remembered: He did his best and he believed in God.      I wish I were up and around, but I\'m doing the best that I can. There\'s so much I have to be grateful for.

If you think it\'s difficult to meet new people, try picking up the wrong golf ball.      The worst part about being me is when people want me to make them laugh.      I won\'t quit until I get run over by a truck, a producer or a critic.      It\'s hard enough to write a good drama, it\'s much harder to write a good comedy, and it\'s hardest of all to write a drama with comedy. Which is what life is.      Nobody deserves this much money - certainly not an actor.      [on Marilyn Monroe] Difficult? Yes. But she was a wonderful comedienne and she had a charisma like no one before or since.      [on Judy Holliday] She was intelligent and not at all like the dumb blonds she so often depicted. She didn\'t give a damn where the camera was placed, how she was made to look, or about being a star. She just played the scene -- acted with, not at. She was also one of the nicest people I ever met.      [on Billy Wilder] I\'ve had directors who were marvelous at breaking scenes down and handling people. But when you would string all the pearls together, they wouldn\'t make a beautiful necklace. But Billy is the kind of picture-maker who can make a beautiful string of pearls. He makes the kind of movies that are classics and last forever.      [on Walter Matthau] Walter is a helluva actor. The best I\'ve ever worked with.      [on Shirley MacLaine] She hated rehearsals and had a bad habit of ad-libbing, which didn\'t set well with Billy Wilder. But we got used to each other, because mainly she\'s a helluva girl.      (On comedic roles in 1970) I really can\'t be funny unless it\'s part of the character. It really bugs me when someone thinks of me as a comic. If I read \'comedian Jack Lemmon,\' I gag. That means I\'m not an actor - which I am.      (In a 1984 interview) ""I\'ve worked with great actors, great directors, and had some marvelous parts. Oh, my God, I don\'t know any actor who has had more tremendous parts! I really don\'t. I don\'t know of one, and I think it\'s why we\'re sitting here. I think it\'s why I\'m still around.      (on Judy Holliday) She was one of the greats, and her early death was one of the great tragedies. She was also one of the nicest people I ever hope to meet. She was hardly the dizzy blonde. If she were alive today, she would\'ve zipped right through the Mensa puzzles. God, I was sweating gumdrops, on the plane coming here trying to do those those suckers.      (On Marilyn Monroe) ... a good light comedienne, unique. She wasn\'t that enormously talented, but her gift was knowing how to use the special kind of talent she had to great advantage... I really couldn\'t get to know what was inside her. She would put up a glass window and never let anyone in.      It\'s better to work with a Billy Wilder once or with a John Ford once than to work with four other directors who do not have that touch of genius.      Wilder goes for the home run every time, and sometimes he strikes out. So did Babe Ruth, but Ruth was the greatest of them all, and, in my opinion, so is Billy.      Failure seldom stops you. What stops you is the fear of failure.Salary (7)Some Like It Hot\xa0(1959)      $100,000       The Apartment\xa0(1960)      $175,000       Irma la Douce\xa0(1963)      $350,000 + 7.5% of the gross.

Kashfi is often thought of as being Indian but several newspapers have said that she is, in fact, the daughter of a Welsh factory worker, William Callaghan, and simply reinvented herself to increase her screen appeal. In her 1979 memoir, Kashfi still held onto the claim that she is Indian by insisting that she is the product of an ""unregistered alliance"" between Selma Ghose and an Indian architect named Devi Kashfi, and that William Callaghan is her stepfather. She met Brando in 1955 in the Paramount commissary and after an on-off relationship (mainly due to Brando\'s relentless womanizing) married him in 1957. (Brando claimed that he married her only because she had become pregnant.) She gave birth in May 1958 to their son, Christian, who became notorious in 1990 for shooting dead Dag Drollet, a crime that earned him a ten-year jail sentence. Kashfi divorced Brando in 1959. She remarried a Los Angeles businessman named James Hannaford in 1974, but he died in 1987. She also outlived her first husband Marlon Brando (who died in 2004) and their son Christian (who died in 2008).

He lied about his age (he was actually 14) in 1916 so he could join the army. When Gen. John J. Pershing sent American troops to invade Mexico in pursuit of Pancho Villa--Mexican rebels under Villa\'s command raided Columbus, NM, and killed 16 American soldiers and civilians--Donlevy served with that expedition and later, in WW I, was a pilot with the Lafayette Escadrille, a unit of the French Air Force comprised of American and Canadian pilots. His schooling was in Cleveland, OH, but in addition he spent two years at the US Naval Academy at Annapolis, MD. However, he gave up on a military career for the stage. After having landed several smaller roles, he got a part in ""What Price Glory"" and established himself as a bona fide actor. Later such roles on stage as ""Three for One"", ""The Milky Way"" and ""Life Begins at 8:30"" gave him the experience to head off to Hollywood. Donlevy began his Hollywood career with the silent film A Man of Quality (1926) and his first talkie was Gentlemen of the Press (1929) (in which he had a bit part). There was a five- to six-year gap before he reappeared on the film scene in 1935 with three pictures: Mary Burns, Fugitive (1935), Another Face (1935) and Barbary Coast (1935), which was his springboard into film history. Receiving rave reviews as ""the tough guy all in black"", acting jobs finally began to roll his way. In 1936 he starred in seven films, including Strike Me Pink (1936), in which he played the tough guy to Eddie Cantor\'s sweet bumpkin Eddie Pink. In all, from 1926 to 1969 Donlevy starred in at least 89 films, reprising one of his Broadway roles as a prizefighter in The Milky Way (1940), and had his own television series (which he also produced), Dangerous Assignment (1952). In 1939 he received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of the sadistic Sgt. Markoff in Paramount\'s Beau Geste (1939), its remake of an earlier silent hit. The Great McGinty (1940), a Preston Sturges comedy about a poor homeless slob who makes it to Governor of a state with the mob\'s help, is a brilliant character study of a man and the changes he goes through to please himself, those around him and, eventually, the woman he loves. A line in the film, spoken by Mrs. McGinty, seems a fitting description of the majority of roles Brian Donlevy would play throughout his career: "". . . You\'re a tough guy, McGinty, not a wrong guy."" Donlevy\'s ability to make the roughest edge of any character have a soft side was his calling card. He perfected it and no one has quite mastered it since. He later, in 1944, reprised that role in The Miracle of Morgan\'s Creek (1944). By 1935 Donlevy was working for 20th Century-Fox and had just completed filming 36 Hours to Kill (1936) when he became engaged to young singer Marjorie Lane, and they married the next year. The marriage produced one child, Judy, but ended in divorce in 1947. It was 19 years before he remarried. In 1966, Bela Lugosi\'s ex-wife Lillian became Mrs. Brian Donlevy, and they were married until his death in 1972. Donlevy had always derived great pleasure from his two diverse interests, gold mining and writing poetry, so it was fitting that after his last film, Pit Stop (1969), he retired to Palm Springs, CA, where he began to write short stories and had his income well supplemented from a prosperous California tungsten mine he owned. Having gone in for throat surgery in 1971 he re-entered the Motion Picture County Hospital in Woodland Hills, CA, on March 10th, 1972. Less than a month later, on April 6, he passed away from cancer.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Jane Byron Dean <McGinty@aol.com>          Spouse (3)               Lillian Arch Lugosi          (25 February\xa01966            - 5 April\xa01972)\xa0(his death)           Marjorie Lane (31 December\xa01936            - 20 January\xa01948)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)                         Yvonne Grey          (5 October\xa01928            - 1 February\xa01936)\xa0(divorced)          Trivia (16)      Sassy-talking, rugged-looking, square-shouldered supporting actor said, however, always to have gone through this necessary morning ritual before arriving on the movie set: 1) insert dentures; 2) don hairpiece; 3) strap on corset; 4) lace up ""elevator"" shoes.      Played historical figure William Quantrill, the leader of a Confederate guerrilla band during the US Civil War, in two films: Kansas Raiders (1950) and Woman They Almost Lynched (1953). The second was not a sequel to the first.      His character, Gil Warren, in In Old Chicago (1937) died as a result of the Chicago fire. His character, Steely Edwards, in \'The Great Man\'s Lady (1942) died in the San Francisco fire.      When he was working on I Wanted Wings (1941) with Ray Milland they filmed on an actual military base and he played Capt. Mercer. He got so uncomfortable with soldiers thinking he was a real captain and saluting him that he wore a sign around his neck that said, ""Actor"".      On January 11, 1950, he crashed the plane he was flying into a hillside near Solvang, CA, but miraculously walked away unhurt.      The two overriding interests in his life were gold mining and writing poetry.      According to a statement in a 1944 movie magazine, Donlevy did not smoke or play cards. The only smoking he did was ""for the movies"".      It\'s widely believed that Ray Milland accidentally cut Donlevy\'s shoulder during the filming of Beau Geste (1939) when he missed Donlevy\'s protective padding with his bayonet. This legend was recently repeated on American Movie Classics (AMC) during an airing of the film. In actuality, Ray stabbed him in the lower left ribcage. The wound was deep enough to not only make him bleed but resulted in a scar that Donlevy bore for the rest of his life.      In Birth of the Blues (1941) Donlevy\'s cornet playing was dubbed by \'Pokey\' Carriere.      He was William Holden\'s best man at his 1941 wedding to Brenda Marshall.      Father of Judy Donlevy.      Step-father of Bela Lugosi Jr..      Besides television, he also portrayed government spy Steve Mitchell on NBC Radio\'s ""Dangerous Assignment"" (1949-1953).      Although he is typically credited as having been with the Lafayette Escadrille, he was not. However he was a member of a group of young American men who went to France and received flight training there in WWI. As such, he was an honorary member of The Lafayette Flying Corps (also known as the Franco-American Flying Corps). The Corps was never officially a unit, it is a collective name for all American pilots -- including the Lafayette Escadrille pilots -- who flew for the French during World War I. The exact number of actual pilots who flew for the French is open to question and many different numbers exist depending on who is counting. The numbers range from as low as 180 to over 300. The most widely accepted number of men who were recognized as having successfully completed French flight training (received their ""brevets"") is 209. Of this 209, only 180 actually served at the Front in combat divided among 66 French pursuit escadrilles and 27 bomber/observer escadrilles.      He is the only actor to play Professor Bernard Quatermass on screen more than once, which he did in the Hammer science fiction film The Quatermass Xperiment (1955) and its sequel Quatermass 2 (1957). In spite of this, he was reportedly ""Quatermass"" creator Nigel Kneale\'s least favourite actor in the role.

I found this movie to be excellent. I think it did not find an audience
because of its dark tone. It explores the concept of death in a unique
way for a western. The light comedy interspersed was a nice relief.
Definitely worth watching for any western fans. Glenn Ford was
magnificent. Jack Lemmon, while showing his flair for comedy, was
subtly profound. The movie itself is profound in a subtle way. We can
relate to Lemmon's character easily-stuck in a boring job and wishing
for something more. Finding something more however, doesn't bring the
joy he thought it would. He changes and grows;his relationship with
Ford is terrific. This is not a western that glorifies the life of the
cowboy. Rather, you see the grim, hard life that tries to suck the
sweetness of man out of him.

I think that this is one of Glenn Ford's best performances.  He plays
against type cast as a tough rancher with not much heart.  Jack
Lemmon provides the heart for the film.  The film is realistic in it's
portrayal of western life in the ninteenth century and is based on
the Writer Frank Harris's real story.  Frank Harris was a hotel clerk
who wanted to be a cowboy so bad that he gave his own money to
buy a piece of the stock from Glen Ford's ranch with the condition
that he could ride the trail.  Glen Ford loses his money gambling
and has to take Harris(Lemmon's) deal in order to buy more
cattle.
Along the trail Lemmon finds the work hard and the men that he
associates with harder.  Harris becomes tough but learns a
lesson and in the end teaches something to Glen Ford along the
way.  
The only problem with the dvd version is that it is in pan and scan
format and it should be in wide screen as this is an epic western
that needs the wide screen.  I recommend that the viewer who
really wants to see this in widescreen request it on turner classic
movies as that is the only place where you can see it that
way.
Enjoy this movie any way you can see it however.  It is like a good
novel.

As one of the other reviewers pointed out, this whole film is based on
a few lines of an autobiography where the protagonist Frank Harris
joins a group of cattle RUSTLERS for a spell. So in fact that as tough
as Glenn Ford and his crew are, at least they're on the right side of
the law. <br><br>Also Frank Harris is probably best known for the first definitive life
of Oscar Wilde. And Harris like Wilde was born in Ireland. Might have
been nice if Jack Lemmon had played him with a brogue.<br><br>Another reviewer pointed out that Jack Lemmon did not fit into the
western film. True enough, but in fact this is the story of a
tenderfoot who goes on a cattle drive and has quite the adventure. <br><br>Still and all Cowboy is a pretty good realistic western about life on a
cattle drive. These drovers aren't any kind of heroic, but they do the
job that has to be done. Jack Lemmon's ideas about cowboys are taken
from the dime novels of the period. He gets rid of his romantic
notions, but fast.<br><br>Among the supporting cast Brian Donlevy comes off best as the world
weary former town marshal who joins the drive to get away from his job
and meets a tragic end. <br><br>Cowboy came out in 1958 which was the height of Glenn Ford's career.
Ford did some of the best westerns of the 1950s and Cowboy ranks right
up there.

Delmer Daves was very successful with this film, about how a young hotel
clerk (Lemmon) becomes a cowboy, but most of all how he becomes a man. Daves
takes us on journey, driving a cattle herd from Mexico to finally place them
on the Santa Fe train bound for Chicago, and he manages to keep us
interested every moment. There is a snake, an Indian attack, wild horses, a
cattle stampede, cowboys fighting...What is impressive is the efficiency
with which Glenn Ford commands the operation, no time is lost, everything
must be done to deliver the herd
with as few losses as possible. Lemmon starts becoming like Ford, obsessed
about his task, when they both learn something about human
values.

The most interesting thing to me about this Western was the not so
flattering portrayal of the cowhands involved. Not a buddy-buddy bunch
of guys riding the lone prairie, but a dog eat dog
if-it-don't-concern-me-personally-then-I-don't-want-to-hear-about-it
sort of existence. I haven't read the (autobiographical) book on which
the movie was based, but it's easy to see that this perspective was
taken from it because it rings true to human nature. The rattlesnake
episode was disturbing (for a 1958 film) because the initiator of the
'prank' was left entirely unpunished (and he even tries to steal the
dead man's boots, for crying out loud!) These guys were some sorry
specimens, but maybe that's what weeks in the saddle tending cattle in
the heat and dust and rain does to people. It must have hardened a man
to just the degree that was shown in this worthwhile, offbeat film.

Circumstances force a tough trail boss (Ford) to take on a former hotel
bellboy (Lemmon) as his partner in a trail drive, on condition that
Lemmon can go along on the drive. Along the way he finds out that a
cowboy's life isn't as glamorous or romantic as he thought it would be,
and a whole lot more dangerous besides. This is a vastly entertaining
film, mainly because Lemmon and Ford work so well together. Lemmon knew
exactly how far to go in showing boyish enthusiasm and excitement
without making it seem childish or juvenile, and he stays right on that
fine line here. Ford's character is a weary cattleman who's seen and
done it all, and knows what Lemmon is in for, tries to tell him and
gets annoyed when he won't listen, and the two complement each other
perfectly. A top-notch supporting cast helps things immensely, and
Delmer Daves' directs smoothly, interspersing drama and humor in just
the right amounts. A very, very enjoyable film.

This is quite a good western. It's not a John Wayne style western, with
the big hero triumphant over some nasty adversary etc., or some hired
gunman coming into town to do a clean-up job for an aggrieved widow,
but it's a more serious type of western picture, telling a true story
of cowboy life. I saw that it was due to come on TV, and I ran a tape
over it, even though I had never seen nor heard of it before. I was
intrigued that Jack Lemmon would be in a cowboy picture, and I just
couldn't envisage him in that genre. I guess that I'm too used to
seeing him in comedic roles. Well, for the first half of the movie I
watched him, and I kept seeing Jack Lemmon the comic, even though he
was portraying a serious cowboy. However, after I got engrossed in the
story a bit, I realised that Mr Lemmon was really doing a good job, and
I stopped seeing the comic Lemmon, and saw instead the cowboy which he
had suddenly become. I must say that he impressed me greatly with his
portrayal, and I admire his versatility even more now. <br><br>Glenn Ford does a great job too, as always, but we have seen him in
roles like this before. He and Jack bounce their portrayals off each
other with wonderful effect, and they work extremely well together. <br><br>I was also surprised to see Dick York pop up as one of the cowhands,
and he makes a really good job of it too. Look out also for Strother
Martin and Richard Jaeckel.<br><br>I think that this picture is a surprise package in several ways, and
well worth watching. It is an enjoyable true story, with great scenery,
and good acting from a great collection of stars. It is a must-see for
any western buff. 8/10.

Cowboy is directed by Delmer Daves and adapted to screenplay by Edmund
H. North and Dalton Trumbo from Frank Harris' book My Reminiscences as
a Cowboy. It stars Glenn Ford, Jack Lemmon, Víctor Manuel Mendoza, Anna
Kashfi, Dick York, King Donovan, Brian Donlevy and Richard Jaeckel.
Music is by George Duning and cinematography by Charles Lawton Junior.<br><br>Based on Frank Harris' memoir, the story finds Lemmon as Harris, a
Chicago hotel clerk who in an attempt to prove he is a man and impress
the girl he loves, wrangles his way onto a cattle drive being led by
rough and tough cowpoke Tom Reece (Ford). He soon finds that out there
on the range, in amongst the dust, beef and perils of the west, that
life is far from glamorous.<br><br>Once you buy into Lemmon as a Western character, accepting his
transference from utter greenhorn into a man of the drive, it really
becomes a very good film. It's a sort of debunking of the cowpoke myths
whilst playing out as a character study of two men, who are polar
opposites, as they build an understanding and ultimately help each
other to grow and learn. Along the way, from Chicago to the Rio Grande,
there is fights, death, stampedes and tests of loyalties and manhood.
The great Delmer Daves directs it without fuss or filler (how nice that
the romantic arc is rightly a side issue and doesn't get in the way)
and Lawton's photography brings the sprawling landscapes to life. <br><br>Lead cast members are excellent, with Ford once again providing rich
characterisation by way of layered acting, and Lemmon rises up to the
challenge of genre work outside of what he would be known for. In
support Donlevy is his usual excellent self, making what could have
been a clichéd character (aging gunfighter wants to leave his past
behind) interesting with emotional depth, and Mendoza as the Ramrod is
good foil for Ford. There's some quibbles, such as Dick York hard to
take seriously, Jaeckel and Strother Martin (uncredited) wasted and
some of the humour doesn't come off. But this is a very enjoyable film,
one that thrives on having some character depth and actually something
worthy to say. 7.5/10

Frank Harris was a hotel clerk who had always dreamed of becoming a
ranch hand. When circumstances provided him with an opportunity, he did
just that. The movie which is based on his real life exploit is called
"" Cowboy."" In it Jack Lemmon plays Harris who buys a partnership with
Cattle boss Tom Reese (Glen Ford) and is reluctantly hired on as a
tenderfoot cowboy. Directed by Delmer Daves, Harris encounters all the
hardships warn him by Tom Reese. What he further learns is the hard
lessons concerning life and death on the trail. Reese is a hard brand
who bestows the harsh lessons on his apprentice to such a degree, that
what he develops into, is a replica of an uncaring, unsympathetic tough
as leather trail hand. From an audience point of view, Ford fits
comfortable in his role, but Lemmon seems a bit out of his element.
Still, it's fun to watch as both men work to ply their craft. A good
film with the addition of experienced cast members, like Brian Donlevy
and Dick York. Recommended to Ford and Lemmon fans. ***

Ford is terrific. This is not a western that glorifies the life of the
cowboy. Rather, you see the grim, hard life that tries to suck the
sweetness of man out of him.

I think that this is one of Glenn Ford's best performances.  He plays
against type cast as a tough rancher with not much heart.  Jack
Lemmon provides the heart for the film.  The film is realistic in it's
portrayal of western life in the ninteenth century and is based on
the Writer Frank Harris's real story.  Frank Harris was a hotel clerk
who wanted to be a cowboy so bad that he gave his own money to
buy a piece of the stock from Glen Ford's ranch with the condition
that he could ride the trail.  Glen Ford loses his money gambling
and has to take Harris(Lemmon's) deal in order to buy more
cattle.
Along the trail Lemmon finds the work hard and the men that he
associates with harder.  Harris becomes tough but learns a
lesson and in the end teaches something to Glen Ford along the
way.  
The only problem with the dvd version is that it is in pan and scan
format and it should be in wide screen as this is an epic western
that needs the wide screen.  I recommend that the viewer who
really wants to see this in widescreen request it on turner classic
movies as that is the only place where you can see it that
way.
Enjoy this movie any way you can see it however.  It is like a good
novel.

As one of the other reviewers pointed out, this whole film is based on
a few lines of an autobiography where the protagonist Frank Harris
joins a group of cattle RUSTLERS for a spell. So in fact that as tough
as Glenn Ford and his crew are, at least they're on the right side of
the law. <br><br>Also Frank Harris is probably best known for the first definitive life
of Oscar Wilde. And Harris like Wilde was born in Ireland. Might have
been nice if Jack Lemmon had played him with a brogue.<br><br>Another reviewer pointed out that Jack Lemmon did not fit into the
western film. True enough, but in fact this is the story of a
tenderfoot who goes on a cattle drive and has quite the adventure. <br><br>Still and all Cowboy is a pretty good realistic western about life on a
cattle drive. These drovers aren't any kind of heroic, but they do the
job that has to be done. Jack Lemmon's ideas about cowboys are taken
from the dime novels of the period. He gets rid of his romantic
notions, but fast.<br><br>Among the supporting cast Brian Donlevy comes off best as the world
weary former town marshal who joins the drive to get away from his job
and meets a tragic end. <br><br>Cowboy came out in 1958 which was the height of Glenn Ford's career.
Ford did some of the best westerns of the 1950s and Cowboy ranks right
up there.

Delmer Daves was very successful with this film, about how a young hotel
clerk (Lemmon) becomes a cowboy, but most of all how he becomes a man. Daves
takes us on journey, driving a cattle herd from Mexico to finally place them
on the Santa Fe train bound for Chicago, and he manages to keep us
interested every moment. There is a snake, an Indian attack, wild horses, a
cattle stampede, cowboys fighting...What is impressive is the efficiency
with which Glenn Ford commands the operation, no time is lost, everything
must be done to deliver the herd
with as few losses as possible. Lemmon starts becoming like Ford, obsessed
about his task, when they both learn something about human
values.

The most interesting thing to me about this Western was the not so
flattering portrayal of the cowhands involved. Not a buddy-buddy bunch
of guys riding the lone prairie, but a dog eat dog
if-it-don't-concern-me-personally-then-I-don't-want-to-hear-about-it
sort of existence. I haven't read the (autobiographical) book on which
the movie was based, but it's easy to see that this perspective was
taken from it because it rings true to human nature. The rattlesnake
episode was disturbing (for a 1958 film) because the initiator of the
'prank' was left entirely unpunished (and he even tries to steal the
dead man's boots, for crying out loud!) These guys were some sorry
specimens, but maybe that's what weeks in the saddle tending cattle in
the heat and dust and rain does to people. It must have hardened a man
to just the degree that was shown in this worthwhile, offbeat film.

Circumstances force a tough trail boss (Ford) to take on a former hotel
bellboy (Lemmon) as his partner in a trail drive, on condition that
Lemmon can go along on the drive. Along the way he finds out that a
cowboy's life isn't as glamorous or romantic as he thought it would be,
and a whole lot more dangerous besides. This is a vastly entertaining
film, mainly because Lemmon and Ford work so well together. Lemmon knew
exactly how far to go in showing boyish enthusiasm and excitement
without making it seem childish or juvenile, and he stays right on that
fine line here. Ford's character is a weary cattleman who's seen and
done it all, and knows what Lemmon is in for, tries to tell him and
gets annoyed when he won't listen, and the two complement each other
perfectly. A top-notch supporting cast helps things immensely, and
Delmer Daves' directs smoothly, interspersing drama and humor in just
the right amounts. A very, very enjoyable film.

The attitudes and comments of the actors playing drovers of cattle from
Texas to Kansas were the closest to those of real cowboys ever put on
the screen.<br><br>I worked as a rider for the cattle association for a while and the
personalities were the same.<br><br>The joke that Jack Limon had never rode a horse so he should get a
horse that had never been ridden was real cowhand humor.<br><br>The cowboys finding that city living was too rough for them after
partying in Chicago for a few days, and they best get back out on the
trail where it was safe, was real cowhand humor.<br><br>The change in Jack as he became more interested in the profit and less
being the dude was realistic.<br><br>This was a movie showing real history of a tough business that would
soon fade into romantic lore.

This is quite a good western. It's not a John Wayne style western, with
the big hero triumphant over some nasty adversary etc., or some hired
gunman coming into town to do a clean-up job for an aggrieved widow,
but it's a more serious type of western picture, telling a true story
of cowboy life. I saw that it was due to come on TV, and I ran a tape
over it, even though I had never seen nor heard of it before. I was
intrigued that Jack Lemmon would be in a cowboy picture, and I just
couldn't envisage him in that genre. I guess that I'm too used to
seeing him in comedic roles. Well, for the first half of the movie I
watched him, and I kept seeing Jack Lemmon the comic, even though he
was portraying a serious cowboy. However, after I got engrossed in the
story a bit, I realised that Mr Lemmon was really doing a good job, and
I stopped seeing the comic Lemmon, and saw instead the cowboy which he
had suddenly become. I must say that he impressed me greatly with his
portrayal, and I admire his versatility even more now. <br><br>Glenn Ford does a great job too, as always, but we have seen him in
roles like this before. He and Jack bounce their portrayals off each
other with wonderful effect, and they work extremely well together. <br><br>I was also surprised to see Dick York pop up as one of the cowhands,
and he makes a really good job of it too. Look out also for Strother
Martin and Richard Jaeckel.<br><br>I think that this picture is a surprise package in several ways, and
well worth watching. It is an enjoyable true story, with great scenery,
and good acting from a great collection of stars. It is a must-see for
any western buff. 8/10.

Cowboy is directed by Delmer Daves and adapted to screenplay by Edmund
H. North and Dalton Trumbo from Frank Harris' book My Reminiscences as
a Cowboy. It stars Glenn Ford, Jack Lemmon, Víctor Manuel Mendoza, Anna
Kashfi, Dick York, King Donovan, Brian Donlevy and Richard Jaeckel.
Music is by George Duning and cinematography by Charles Lawton Junior.<br><br>Based on Frank Harris' memoir, the story finds Lemmon as Harris, a
Chicago hotel clerk who in an attempt to prove he is a man and impress
the girl he loves, wrangles his way onto a cattle drive being led by
rough and tough cowpoke Tom Reece (Ford). He soon finds that out there
on the range, in amongst the dust, beef and perils of the west, that
life is far from glamorous.<br><br>Once you buy into Lemmon as a Western character, accepting his
transference from utter greenhorn into a man of the drive, it really
becomes a very good film. It's a sort of debunking of the cowpoke myths
whilst playing out as a character study of two men, who are polar
opposites, as they build an understanding and ultimately help each
other to grow and learn. Along the way, from Chicago to the Rio Grande,
there is fights, death, stampedes and tests of loyalties and manhood.
The great Delmer Daves directs it without fuss or filler (how nice that
the romantic arc is rightly a side issue and doesn't get in the way)
and Lawton's photography brings the sprawling landscapes to life. <br><br>Lead cast members are excellent, with Ford once again providing rich
characterisation by way of layered acting, and Lemmon rises up to the
challenge of genre work outside of what he would be known for. In
support Donlevy is his usual excellent self, making what could have
been a clichéd character (aging gunfighter wants to leave his past
behind) interesting with emotional depth, and Mendoza as the Ramrod is
good foil for Ford. There's some quibbles, such as Dick York hard to
take seriously, Jaeckel and Strother Martin (uncredited) wasted and
some of the humour doesn't come off. But this is a very enjoyable film,
one that thrives on having some character depth and actually something
worthy to say. 7.5/10

Frank Harris was a hotel clerk who had always dreamed of becoming a
ranch hand. When circumstances provided him with an opportunity, he did
just that. The movie which is based on his real life exploit is called
"" Cowboy."" In it Jack Lemmon plays Harris who buys a partnership with
Cattle boss Tom Reese (Glen Ford) and is reluctantly hired on as a
tenderfoot cowboy. Directed by Delmer Daves, Harris encounters all the
hardships warn him by Tom Reese. What he further learns is the hard
lessons concerning life and death on the trail. Reese is a hard brand
who bestows the harsh lessons on his apprentice to such a degree, that
what he develops into, is a replica of an uncaring, unsympathetic tough
as leather trail hand. From an audience point of view, Ford fits
comfortable in his role, but Lemmon seems a bit out of his element.
Still, it's fun to watch as both men work to ply their craft. A good
film with the addition of experienced cast members, like Brian Donlevy
and Dick York. Recommended to Ford and Lemmon fans. ***

Kiss of Death (1947) and other noir thrillers established Widmark as part of a new generation of American movie actors who became stars in the post-World War II era. With fellow post-War stars Kirk Douglas and Robert Mitchum, Widmark brought a new kind of character to the screen in his character leads and supporting parts: a hardboiled type who does not actively court the sympathy of the audience. Widmark was not afraid to play deeply troubled, deeply conflicted, or just down right deeply corrupt characters.After his debut, Widmark would work steadily until he retired at the age of 76 in 1990, primarily as a character lead. His stardom would peak around the time he played the U.S. prosecutor in Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) as the 1950s segued into the 1960s, but he would continue to act for another 30 years.Richard Weedt Widmark was born in Sunrise Township, Minnesota, to Ethel Mae (Barr) and Carl Henry Widmark. His father was of Swedish descent and his mother of English and Scottish ancestry. He has said that he loved the movies from his boyhood, claiming ""I\'ve been a movie bug since I was 4. My grandmother used to take me"". The teen-aged Widmark continued to go to the movies, and was thrilled by Dracula (1931) and Frankenstein (1931). ""I thought Boris Karloff was great"", Widmark said. Although he loved the movies and excelled at public speaking while attending high school, Widmark attended Lake Forest College with the idea of becoming a lawyer. However, he won the lead role in a college production of, fittingly enough, the play ""Consellor-at-Law"", and the acting bug bit deep. After taking his bachelor of arts degree in 1936, he stayed on at Lake Forest as the Assistant Director of Speech and Drama. However, he soon quit the job and moved to New York to become an actor and, by 1938, he was appearing on radio in ""Aunt Jenny\'s Real Life Stories"". He made his Broadway debut in 1943 in the play ""Kiss and Tell"", and continued to appear on stage in roles that were light years away from the tough cookies he would play in his early movies.After World War II, he was signed by 20th Century Fox to a seven-year contract. After seeing his screen-test for the role of ""Tommy Udo"", 20th Century Fox boss Darryl F. Zanuck insisted that the slight, blonde Widmark - no one\'s idea of a heavy, particularly after his stage work - be cast as the psychopath in Kiss of Death (1947), which had been prepared as a Victor Mature vehicle. Even though the role was small, Widmark stole the picture. 20th Century Fox\'s publicity department recommended that exhibitors market the film by concentrating on thumbing the tub for their new anti-hero. ""Sell Richard Widmark"" advised the studio\'s publicity manual that an alert 20th Century Fox sent to theater owners. The manual told local exhibitors to engage a job-printer to have ""Wanted"" posters featuring Widmark\'s face to be printed and pasted up. He won a Golden Globe and an Oscar nod for the part, which lead to an early bout with typecasting at the studio. Widmark played psychotics in The Street with No Name (1948) and Road House (1948), and held his own against new Fox superstar Gregory Peck in the William A. Wellman\'s Western, Yellow Sky (1948), playing the villain, of course. When he finally pressured the studio to let him play other parts, his appearance as a sailor in Down to the Sea in Ships (1949) made headlines: ""Life"" magazine\'s March 28, 1949 issue featured a three-page spread of the movie, headlined, ""Widmark the Movie Villain Goes Straight"". He was popular, having captured the public imagination, and before the decade was out, his hand and footprints were immortalized in concrete in the court outside Grauman\'s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.The great director Elia Kazan cast Widmark in his thriller Panic in the Streets (1950) not as the heavy - that role went to Jack Palance - but as the physician who tracks down Palance, who has the plague, in tandem with detective Paul Douglas. Widmark was establishing himself as a real presence in the genre that later would be hailed as ""film noir"". Having proved he could handle other roles, Widmark didn\'t shy away from playing heavies in quality pictures. The soon-to-be-blacklisted director Jules Dassin cast him in one of his greatest roles, as the penny-ante hustler ""Harry Fabian"" in Night and the City (1950). Set in London, Widmark\'s Fabian manages to survive in the jungle of the English demimonde, but is doomed. Widmark was masterful in conveying the desperation of the criminal seeking to control his own fate but who is damned, and this performance also became an icon of film noir. In that same year, he appeared in Oscar-winning writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz\'s No Way Out (1950) as a bigot who instigates a race riot.As the 1950s progressed, Widmark played in Westerns, military vehicles, and his old stand-by genre, the thriller. He appeared with Marilyn Monroe (this time cast as the psycho) in Don\'t Bother to Knock (1952) and made Pickup on South Street (1953) that same year for director Samuel Fuller. His seven-year contract at Fox was expiring, and Zanuck - who would not renew the deal - cast him in the Western Broken Lance (1954) in a decidedly supporting role, billed beneath not only Spencer Tracy but even Robert Wagner and Jean Peters. The film was well-respected, and it won an Oscar nomination for best screenplay for the front of Hollywood 10 blacklistee Albert Maltz. Widmark left Fox for the life of a freelance, forming his own company, ""Heath Productions"". He appeared in more Westerns, adventures and social dramas, and pushed himself as an actor by taking the thankless role of ""The Dauphin"" in Otto Preminger\'s adaptation of George Bernard Shaw\'s Saint Joan (1957), a notorious flop that didn\'t bring anyone any honors, neither Preminger, his leading lady Jean Seberg or Widmark. In 1960, he was appearing in another notorious production, John Wayne\'s ode to suicidal patriotism, The Alamo (1960), with the personally liberal Widmark playing ""Jim Bowie"" in support of the very-conservative Wayne\'s ""Davy Crockett"". Along with character actor Chill Wills, Widmark arguably was the best thing in the movie.In 1961, Widmark acquitted himself quite well as the prosecutor in producer-director Stanley Kramer\'s Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), appearing with the Oscar-nominated Spencer Tracy and the Oscar-winning Maximilian Schell, as well as with superstar Burt Lancaster and acting genius Montgomery Clift and the legendary \'Judy Garland\' (the latter two winning Oscar nods for their small roles). Despite being showcased with all this thespian-firepower, Widmark\'s character proved to be the axis on which the drama turned. A little later, Widmark appeared in two Westerns directed by the great John Ford, with co-star James Stewart in Two Rode Together (1961) and as the top star in Ford\'s apologia for Indian genocide, Cheyenne Autumn (1964). On Two Rode Together (1961), Ford feuded with Jimmy Stewart over his hat. Stewart insisted on wearing the same hat he had for a decade of highly successful Westerns that had made him one of the top box office stars of the 1950s. Both he and Widmark were hard-of-hearing (as well as balding and in need of help from the makeup department\'s wig-makers), so Ford would sit himself far away from them while directing scenes and then give them directions in a barely audible voice. When neither one of the stars could hear their director, Ford theatrically announced to his crew, that after over 40 years in the business, he was reduced to directing two deaf toupees. It was testimony to the stature of both Stewart and Widmark as stars that this was as far as Ford\'s baiting went, as the great director could be extraordinarily cruel.Widmark continued to co-star in A-pictures through the 1960s. He capped off the decade with one of his finest performances, as the amoral police detective in Don Siegel\'s gritty cop melodrama Madigan (1968). Watching ""Madigan"", one can see Widmark\'s characters as a progression in the evolution of what would become the late 1960s nihilistic anti-hero, such as those embodied by Clint Eastwood in Siegel\'s later Dirty Harry (1971). Im the 1970s, he continued to make his mark in movies and, beginning in 1971, in television. In movies, he appeared primarily in supporting roles, albeit in highly billed fashion, in such films as Sidney Lumet\'s Murder on the Orient Express (1974), Robert Aldrich\'s Twilight\'s Last Gleaming (1977), and Stanley Kramer\'s The Domino Principle (1977). He even came back as a heavy, playing the villainous doctor in Coma (1978).In 1971, in search of better roles, he turned to television, starring as the President of the U.S. in the TV movies Vanished (1971). His performance in the role brought Widmark an Emmy nomination. He resurrected the character of ""Madigan"" for NBC, in six 90-minute episodes that appeared as part of the rotation of ""NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie"" for the Fall 1972 season. Widmark was married for 55 years to playwright Jean Hazlewood, from 1942 until her death in 1997 (they had one child, Anne, who was born in 1945). He lived quietly and avoided the press, saying in 1971, ""I think a performer should do his work and then shut up"". ""Los Angeles Times"" critic Kevin Thomas thought that Widmark should have won an Oscar nomination for his turn in When the Legends Die (1972), playing a former rodeo star tutoring \'Frederic Forrest\'.It is surprising to think that Kiss of Death (1947) represented his sole Oscar nomination, but with the rise of the respect for film noir around the time his career began tapering off in 70s, he began to be reevaluated as an actor. Unlike Bogart, who did not live to see his reputation flourish after his death, well before he retired, Widmark became a cult figure.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Martin Lewison and Jon C.

Inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum (2002).      His sole Academy Award nomination was for best actor in a supporting role for Kiss of Death (1947) in 1948. Though he had won the Golden Globe Award for the role, he lost the Oscar to Edmund Gwenn in Miracle on 34th Street (1947).      Was honored with a retrospective of his films by the Museum of Modern Art (New York, New York). [May 2001]      When Kiss of Death (1947) was released to theaters in 1947, 20th Century Fox\'s publicity department encouraged theater owners to ""Sell Richard Widmark!"" Fox\'s publicity manual advised theaters to have a local printer make up ""Wanted"" with Widmark\'s face on them to advertise the film, in which he made his debut. The role was small, but Widmark made this one of the most indelible performances in the history of cinema.      His daughter with wife Jean Hazlewood, Anne Heath Widmark, an artist and author, married baseball legend Sandy Koufax on January 1, 1969.      Has significantly contributed to the preservation of land and nature in his adopted hometown of Roxbury, Connecticut. As one of the founding members of the Roxbury Land Trust, he has tenaciously worked to preserve the pristine character of the Litchfield County town which has been the longtime home of celebrities the likes of Arthur Miller, Marilyn Monroe, and artist Alexander Calder. Actor and Widmark\'s friend, Walter Matthau also owned property in bucolic Roxbury and at Widmark\'s urging, Matthau made a generous contribution of property to the trust shortly before his death.      At 5\' 10"", he was one of the shorter leading men of his era.      His father was Swedish by descent; his mother was English, Scottish and Irish.      He was the stepfather of Amy Fonda, daughter of Henry Fonda and Susan Blanchard.      In fall 2007, he sustained a fractured vertebrae after a fall. He died about six months later of complications.      When his contract at 20th Century Fox expired in 1954 after seven years, he deliberately went independent in order to have more artistic control over his films. He formed his own company, Heath Productions.      Was not able to see active duty during World War II due to a perforated eardrum, but did serve as an air raid warden and entertained servicemen as a member of the American Theatre Wing.      Despite playing heartless killers and bigots on film, he personally denounced all kinds of violence and the usage of guns. He admitted that once he went fishing and regretted the fact he caught a trout and took its life. He also apologized profusely to Sidney Poitier during the shoot of the movie No Way Out (1950) after filming scenes together which called for Widmark to spew out racist remarks.      Earned several awards in oratory contests while a pre-law student at Lake Forest College. He was also active in the drama department and played the lead in the play ""Counselor-at-Law"" as a sophomore.      President of his high school class. He wrote for the high school newspaper.      Born in Sunrise, Minnesota, his father, Carl Widmark, was a general store manager before becoming a traveling salesman. The family eventually settled in Princeton, Illinois, where his father owned a downstairs bakery.      Spent his later years divided between a ranch in Hidden Valley, California, and a farm in Connecticut.John Wayne/Richard Widmark is the sign/countersign used by soldiers holding the Alamo in Viva Max (1969).      Activist for strengthening gun control laws in the United States.      Resided on his mansion in Roxbury, Connecticut from the 1950s until his death.      Was on the first cover of German teen magazine ""Bravo"" together with Marilyn Monroe (1956).      Born to Carl Widmark, a salesman, and his wife Ethal Mae.      His acting idol was Spencer Tracy.      Before he ever became a film actor, Widmark was busy with voice-over work on various radio programs during the 1930s and 1940s.      Featured in ""Bad Boys: The Actors of Film Noir"" by Karen Burroughs Hannsberry (McFarland, 2003).      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6800 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California in February 8, 1960.      Although 27 years old at the time, Widmark was considered for the role of the cocky young sailor eventually played by Robert Walker in Bataan (1943).      He was a lifelong liberal Democrat.      From Sidney Poitier\'s speech about Widmark at the D. W. Griffith Award for Life Achievment: ""... the generosity of spirit that lights his way will also warm your heart..."".      Very touched by Sidney Poitier presenting him with the D. W. Griffith Lifetime Achievment Award in 1990, Widmark said to his old friend, ""Sid, I can\'t believe you came all the way to California to do this for me."" Poitier replied, ""For you I would have walked!"".      He was the first choice of playwright Robert Anderson for both the stage and film versions of I Never Sang for My Father (1970) in the role eventually played by Gene Hackman.      He appeared in a public service short entitled ""Off the Highway"", which was made by USC students and directed by Fred Zinnemann, who talked Widmark--his neighbor at the time--into appearing in it.      Was Frank \'Lefty\' Rosenthal\'s first choice to play the character based on him in Casino (1995). Being that Widmark was 80 years old at the time, the role eventually went to Robert De Niro.      Director Henry Hathaway thought Widmark\'s high forehead looked too intellectual to play Tommy Udo in Kiss of Death (1947), so he had the young actor wear a hairpiece for his screen test.      Widmark and Jean Hazlewood had a daughter, Anne Heath Widmark, who was married to Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax (1969-82). Hazlewood died in March 1997.      In 1947, the crime drama Kiss of Death catapulted Widmark to movie stardom. The actor made one of the most shocking film debuts in movie history as his character, the cackling psychopath Tommy Udo, shoved an older wheelchair-bound woman down a flight of stairs to her death. The role earned Widmark an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor and proved to be the beginning of a distinguished five-decade film career.      Actor Richard Widmark was offered an audition for a radio soap opera two years after college and soon after made his screen debut as the cackling psychopath Tommy Udo in the crime drama Kiss of Death (1947).      Despite his rising career, and happy marriage to his college sweetheart, Ora Jean Hazlewood, the 1940s were a time of great stress for the actor. Unable to serve in World War II due to a perforated eardrum, he spent three anxious years fearing for the life of his brother Donald, a bomber pilot who was injured and held as a prisoner-of-war by the Nazis. Although Donald Widmark was freed at the war\'s end, his failing health over the next decade would be the most agonizing tragedy in Richard\'s life.      In September 1999, Widmark married Susan Blanchard, who was Henry Fonda\'s third wife.      Stereotyped onscreen as a hot-headed villain, Widmark fought for better roles and went on to give complex performances in such film classics as Panic in the Streets (1950), No Way Out (1950) (which introduced him to close friend Sidney Poitier), Night and the City (1950), Broken Lance (1954) (co-starring his idol, Spencer Tracy), and Madigan (1968).      After a turbulent childhood, lightened by his frequent trips to the movies, Widmark became an accomplished high school scholar, a college football star, and eventually a teacher of speech and drama at Lake Forest College in Illinois.      Two years out of college, Widmark headed to New York City in 1938 when a friend offered him an audition for a radio soap opera. Widmark won the role and soon became a busy player in broadcasting and on the Broadway stage (debuting in 1943).      Good friends with Sidney Poitier. They co-starred together in three films: No Way Out (1950), The Long Ships (1964) and The Bedford Incident (1965).      Had appeared with Karl Malden in five films: Kiss of Death (1947), Halls of Montezuma (1951), Take the High Ground! (1953), How the West Was Won (1962) and Cheyenne Autumn (1964).      Had appeared with Henry Fonda in five films: Warlock (1959), How the West Was Won (1962), Madigan (1968), Rollercoaster (1977) and The Swarm (1978).Personal Quotes (25)      [speaking in 1976] The heavies in my day were kid\'s stuff compared to today. Our villains had no redeeming qualities. But there\'s a new morality today. A villain is a guy with a frailty. Heroes are villains.      The more takes I do, the worse I get.      [on his giggling psychopathic killer in his debut film Kiss of Death (1947)] I\'d never seen myself on the screen, and when I did, I wanted to shoot myself. That damn laugh of mine! For two years after that picture, you couldn\'t get me to smile. I played the part the way I did because the script struck me as funny and the part I played made me laugh, the guy was such a ridiculous beast.      I suppose I wanted to act in order to have a place in the sun. I\'d always lived in small towns, and acting meant having some kind of identity.      It\'s weird, the effect actors have on an audience. With the [bad guy] roles I played in those early movies, I found that quite a few people wanted to have a go at me.      It\'s a bit rough priding oneself that one isn\'t too bad an actor and then finding one\'s only remembered for a giggle.Marilyn Monroe wanted to be this great star but acting just scared the hell out of her. That\'s why she was always late--couldn\'t get her on the set. She had trouble remembering lines. But none of it mattered. With a very few special people, something happens between the lens and the film that is pure magic. And she really had it.      [in 2001] I\'m a lifelong liberal. I\'ve never been a real activist--I just shoot my mouth off. When I knew Ronald Reagan, he was an affable, boring fellow. Now he\'s an icon. It\'s incredible. Like half of America, I\'m doubly mystified by Reagan\'s spiritual heir, our current president.      [in 1976] I know I\'ve made kind of a half-assed career out of violence, but I abhor violence. I am an ardent supporter of gun control. It seems incredible to me that we are the only civilized nation that does not put some effective control on guns.      Movie audiences fasten on to one aspect of the actor, and then they decide what they want you to be. They think you\'re playing yourself. The truth is that the only person who can ever really play himself is a baby.      I could choose the director and my fellow actors. I could carry out projects which I liked but the studios didn\'t want. The businessmen who run Hollywood today have no self-respect. What interests them is not movies but the bottom line. Look at Dumb and Dumber (1994), which turns idiocy into something positive, or Forrest Gump (1994), a hymn to stupidity. \'Intellectual\' has become a dirty word.      When I see people destroying their privacy--what they think, what they feel--by beaming it out to millions of viewers, I think it cheapens them as individuals.      [on Spencer Tracy] What an actor should be is exemplified, for me, by him. I like the reality of his acting. It\'s so honest and seems so effortless, even though what Tracy does is the result of damn hard work and extreme concentration. Actually, the ultimate in any art is never to show the wheels grinding. The essence of bad acting, for example, is shouting. Tracy never shouts. He\'s the greatest movie actor there ever was.      I won\'t have a gun in my house.      Many of my friends were blacklisted. America should be ashamed forever.      [upon receiving the D.W. Griffith Award for Lifetime Achievment in 1990] It\'s my second award. The other was for sight reading in the eighth grade.      [1986 interview, on his Kiss of Death (1947) character Tommy Udo] Ben Hecht wrote the script. I don\'t know whether he had indicated the laugh or whether I did it out of nervousness. I think it was probably a combination. [Director Henry Hathaway] liked it and said, ""We could use a little more of that"".      [on Movie Madness (1982)] What a disaster! Who directed that? Oh, Henry Jaglom. Enough said!      [on Hanky Panky (1982)] That went down the tunnel; but I never had so much fun on a dog.      [In a 1971 N.Y. Times interview] I don\'t care how well known an actor is - he can still live a normal life, if he wants to. I still believe it. That\'s the trouble with actors. If they\'re not recognized, they think it\'s all over.      [in 1985, on Henry Hathaway] Through the years Henry and I became very close friends. We did a few pictures together, and he was always tough as nails. Off the set he was a charmer; on the set, he was Hitler!      [in 1986, on Darryl F. Zanuck] We weren\'t crazy about each other. He wasn\'t my cup of tea; he was a first-rate administrator, but a little Napoleon. He had gemutlich with writers and with directors, but no sympathy at all for actors. Of all the moguls, Zanuck was the only one who could make a film. He was a good utter. I didn\'t admire the type of fellow he was. So I was never invited to Palm Springs--or all that nonsense. We had a business relationship, and it worked out very well.      [in 1988, on director William Keighley] Bill Keighley was a very nice man, an elegant gut; he was married to an actress named Genevieve Tobin. He had been with [Darryl F. Zanuck] for years over at Warners. Directed oodles of gangster movies, but he himself was a drawing room type of fellow.      [in 1986 interview, on Marilyn Monroe] She was a vulnerable kid. Murder to work with because she was scared to death of acting--even when she became a big movie actress. We had a hell of a time getting her out of the dressing room. When it was five o\'clock, it got irritating: ""C\'mon, Marilyn, we want to go home!: She was a movie animal. Something happened between the lens and the film. Nobody knew what the hell it was. On the set, you\'d think: ""Oh, this is impossible; you can\'t print this"". You\'d see it, and she\'s got everyone backed off the screen. [Laurence Olivier] said the same thing. She had that phenomenal something! Nobody knows what it is, but she had it. She certainly was never a professional actress. She always had a coach with her, lurking in the background, giving her signals. And she could never remember three words in a row--so it was all piece-work. Beyond all the technical deficiencies, she was a nice girl. We got along fine.      [on not resigning with Fox after seven years] I didn\'t sign a new contract because I was tired of being shot from one movie to another--finishing one on a Saturday and starting another on Monday. I could get more money on the outside and get a wider variety of stuff.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nMarilyn Monroe ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 283 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(5)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(2)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(3)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(4)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(134)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(116)\xa0|Salary\xa0(19)  Overview (5)Date of Birth1\xa0June1926,\xa0Los Angeles, California, USA Date of Death5\xa0August1962,\xa0Los Angeles, California, USA      \xa0(drug overdose)    Birth NameNorma Jeane MortensonNicknamesThe Blonde BombshellMM    Height5\'\xa05½""\xa0(1.66\xa0m)    Mini Bio (2)          Marilyn Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson at the Los Angeles County Hospital on June 1, 1926. Her mother Gladys Pearl Baker was a film-cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. Marilyn\'s father\'s identity was never known. Because Gladys was mentally and financially unable to care for young Marilyn, Gladys placed her in the care of a foster family, The Bolenders. Although the Bolender family wanted to adopt Marilyn, Gladys was eventually able to stabilize her lifestyle and took Marilyn back in her care when Marilyn was 7 years old. However, shortly after regaining custody of Marilyn, Gladys had a complete mental breakdown and was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and was committed to a state mental hospital. Gladys spent the rest of her life going in and out of hospitals and did not have contact with Marilyn ever again. Gladys outlived her daughter, dying in 1984.Marilyn was then taken in by Gladys\' best friend Grace Goddard, who, after a series of foster homes, placed Marilyn into the Los Angeles Orphan\'s Home in 1935. Marilyn was traumatized by her experience there despite the Orphan\'s Home being an adequate living facility. Grace Goddard eventually took Marilyn back to live with her in 1937 although this stay did not last long as Grace\'s husband began molesting Marilyn. Marilyn went to live with Grace\'s Aunt Ana after this incident, although due to Aunt Ana\'s advanced age she could not care properly for Marilyn. Marilyn once again for the third time had to return to live with the Goddard\'s. The Goddard\'s planned to relocated and according to law, could not take Marilyn with them. She only had two choices: return to the orphanage or get married. Marilyn was only 16 years old.She decided to marry a neighborhood friend named James Dougherty; he went into the military, she modeled, they divorced in 1946. She owned 200 books (including Tolstoy, Whitman, Milton), listened to Beethoven records, studied acting at the Actors\' lab in Hollywood, and took literature courses at UCLA downtown. 20th Century Fox gave her a contract but let it lapse a year later. In 1948, Columbia gave her a six-month contract, turned her over to coach Natasha Lytess and featured her in the B movie Ladies of the Chorus (1948) in which she sang three numbers : ""Every Baby Needs a Da Da Daddy"", ""Anyone Can Tell I Love You"" and ""The Ladies of the Chorus"" with Adele Jergens (dubbed by Virginia Rees) and others. Joseph L. Mankiewicz saw her in a small part in The Asphalt Jungle (1950) and put her in All About Eve (1950), resulting in 20th Century re-signing her to a seven-year contract. Niagara (1953) and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) launched her as a sex symbol superstar.When she went to a supper honoring her in the The Seven Year Itch (1955), she arrived in a red chiffon gown borrowed from the studio (she had never owned a gown). That same year, she married and divorced baseball great Joe DiMaggio (their wedding night was spent in Paso Robles, California). After The Seven Year Itch (1955), she wanted serious acting to replace the sexpot image and went to New York\'s Actors Studio. She worked with director Lee Strasberg and also underwent psychoanalysis to learn more about herself. Critics praised her transformation in Bus Stop (1956) and the press was stunned by her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller. True to form, she had no veil to match her beige wedding dress so she dyed one in coffee; he wore one of the two suits he owned. They went to England that fall where she made The Prince and the Showgirl (1957) with Laurence Olivier, fighting with him and falling further prey to alcohol and pills. Two miscarriages and gynecological surgery followed. So did an affair with Yves Montand. Work on her last picture The Misfits (1961), written for her by departing husband Miller was interrupted by exhaustion. She was dropped from the unfinished Something\'s Got to Give (1962) due to chronic lateness and drug dependency.On August 4, 1962, Marilyn Monroe\'s day began with threatening phone calls. Dr. Ralph Greenson, Marilyn\'s physician, came over the following day and quoted later in a document ""felt it was possible that Marilyn Monroe had felt rejected by some of the people she had been close to"". Apart from being upset that her publicist slept too long, she seemed fine. Pat Newcombe, who had stayed the previous night at Marilyn\'s house, left in the early evening as did Greenson who had a dinner date. Marilyn was upset he couldn\'t stay, and around 7:30pm she telephoned him while she was to tell him that her second husband\'s son had called him. Peter Lawford also called Marilyn, inviting her to dinner, but she declined. Lawford later said her speech was slurred. As the dark and depressing evening for Marilyn wore on there were other phone calls, including one from Jose Belanos, who said he thought she sounded fine. According to the funeral directors, Marilyn died sometime between 9:30pm and 11:30pm. Her maid unable to raise her but seeing a light under her locked door, called the police shortly after midnight. She also phoned Ralph Greenson who, on arrival, could not break down the bedroom door. He eventually broke in through French windows and found Marilyn dead in bed. The coroner stated she had died from acute barbiturate poisoning, and it was a \'probable suicide\'.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Ed Stephan <stephan@cc.wwu.edu>                    Probably the most celebrated of all actresses, Marilyn Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson on June 1, 1926, in the charity ward of the Los Angeles General Hospital. Prior to her birth, Marilyn\'s father bought a motorcycle and headed north to San Francisco, abandoning the family in Los Angeles. Marilyn grew up not knowing for sure who her father really was. Her mother, Gladys, had entered into several relationships, further confusing her daughter as to who it was who fathered her. Afterward, Gladys gave Norma Jeane (Marilyn) the name of Baker, a boyfriend she had before Mortenson. Poverty was a constant companion to Gladys and Norma. Gladys, who was extremely attractive and worked for RKO Studios as a filmcutter, suffered from mental illness and was in and out of mental institutions for the rest of her life, and because of that Norma Jeane spent time in foster homes. When she was nine, she was placed in an orphanage where she was to stay for the next two years. Upon being released from the orphanage, she went to yet another foster home. In 1942, at age 16, Norma Jeane married 21-year-old aircraft plant worker James Dougherty. The marriage only lasted four years, and they divorced in 1946. By this time, Marilyn began to model swimsuits and bleached her hair blonde. Various shots made their way into the public eye, where some were eventually seen by RKO Pictures head Howard Hughes. He offered Marilyn a screen test, but an agent suggested that 20th Century-Fox would be the better choice for her, since it was a much bigger and more prestigious studio. She was signed to a contract at $125 per week for a six-month period and that was increased by $25 per week at the end of that time when her contract was lengthened.Her first film was in 1947 with a bit part in The Shocking Miss Pilgrim (1947). Her next production was not much better, a bit in the eminently forgettable Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay! (1948). Two of the three brief scenes in which she appeared wound up on the cutting room floor. Later that same year, she was given a somewhat better role as Evie in Dangerous Years (1947). However, Fox declined to renew her contract, so she went back to modeling and acting school.Columbia Pictures then picked her up to play Peggy Martin in Ladies of the Chorus (1948), where she sang two numbers. Notices from the critics were favorable for her, if not the film, but Columbia dropped her. Once again Marilyn returned to modeling. In 1949, she appeared in United Artists\' Love Happy (1949). It was also that same year she posed nude for the now famous calendar shot which was later to appear in Playboy magazine in 1953 and further boost her career. She would be the first centerfold in that magazine\'s long and illustrious history. The next year proved to be a good year for Marilyn. She appeared in five films, but the good news was that she received very good notices for her roles in two of them, The Asphalt Jungle (1950) from MGM and All About Eve (1950) from Fox. Even though both roles were basically not much more than bit parts, movie fans remembered her dizzy but very sexy blonde performance.In 1951, Marilyn got a fairly sizable role in Love Nest (1951). The public was now getting to know her and liked what it saw. She had an intoxicating quality of volcanic sexuality wrapped in an aura of almost childlike innocence. In 1952, Marilyn appeared in Don\'t Bother to Knock (1952), in which she played a somewhat mentally unbalanced babysitter. Critics didn\'t particularly care for her work in this picture, but she made a much more favorable impression later in the year in Monkey Business (1952), where she was seen for the first time as a platinum blonde, a look that became her trademark. The next year, she appeared in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) as Lorelei Lee. It was also the same year she began dating the baseball great Joe DiMaggio.Marilyn was now a genuine box-office drawing card. Later, she appeared with Betty Grable, Lauren Bacall and Rory Calhoun in How to Marry a Millionaire (1953). Although her co-stars got the rave reviews, it was the sight of Marilyn that really excited the audience, especially the male members. On Thursday, January 14th, 1954, Marilyn wed DiMaggio, then proceeded to film There\'s No Business Like Show Business (1954). That was quickly followed by The Seven Year Itch (1955), which showcased her considerable comedic talent and contained what is arguably one of the most memorable moments in cinema history: Marilyn standing above a subway grating and the wind from a passing subway blowing her white dress up.By October 1954, Marilyn announced her divorce from DiMaggio. The union lasted only eight months. In 1955, she was suspended by Fox for not reporting for work on How to Be Very, Very Popular (1955). It was her second suspension, the first being for not reporting for the production of The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955). Both roles went to others. Her work was slowing down, due to her habit of being continually late to the set, her illnesses (whether real or imagined) and generally being unwilling to cooperate with her producers, directors, and fellow actors.However in Bus Stop (1956), Marilyn finally showed critics that she could play a straight dramatic role. It was also the same year she married playwright, Arthur Miller (they divorced in 1960). In 1957, Marilyn flew to Britain to film The Prince and the Showgirl (1957) which proved less than impressive critically and financially. It made money, but many critics panned it for being slow-moving. After a year off in 1958, Marilyn returned to the screen the next year for the delightful comedy, Some Like It Hot (1959) with Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. The film was an absolute smash hit, with Curtis and Lemmon pretending to be females in an all-girl band, so they can get work. This was to be Marilyn\'s only film for the year.In 1960, Marilyn appeared in George Cukor\'s Let\'s Make Love (1960), with Tony Randall and Yves Montand. Again, while it made money, it was critically panned as stodgy and slow-moving. The following year, Marilyn made what was to be her final film. The Misfits (1961), which also proved to be the final film for the legendary Clark Gable, who died later that year of a heart attack. The film was popular with critics and the public alike. In 1962, Marilyn was chosen to star in Fox\'s Something\'s Got to Give (1962). Again, her absenteeism caused delay after delay in production, resulting in her being fired from the production in June of that year. It looked as though her career was finished. Studios just didn\'t want to take a chance on her because it would cost them thousands of dollars in delays. She was only 36 years old.Marilyn made only 30 films in her lifetime, but her legendary status and mysticism will remain with film history forever.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Denny Jackson          Spouse (3) Arthur Miller (29 June\xa01956            - 20 January\xa01961)\xa0(divorced)           Joe DiMaggio (14 January\xa01954            - 31 October\xa01955)\xa0(divorced)           James Dougherty (19 June\xa01942            - 13 September\xa01946)\xa0(divorced)          Trade Mark (4)        Lisp, breathless voice        Platinum blonde hair        Voluptuous figure        Beauty spot on cheekTrivia (134)      Voted \'Sexiest Woman of the Century\' by People Magazine. [1999]      Was 1947\'s Miss California Artichoke Queen.      In her autobiography, ""My Story"", ghost-written by Ben Hecht, she recounted her guardian told her she was a direct descendant of James Monroe. Her mother\'s maiden name was Monroe, but there is no evidence she was a descendant of the U.S. President.      Was roommates with Shelley Winters when they were both starting out in Hollywood.      Ranked #8 in Empire (UK) magazine\'s ""The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time"" list. [October 1997]      Voted Empire\'s (UK) ""sexiest female movie star of all time"" in 1995.      She was Playboy\'s first ""Sweetheart of the Month"" in December 1953.      When she died in 1962 at age 36, she left an estate valued at $1.6 million. In her will, Monroe bequeathed 75% of that estate to Lee Strasberg, her acting coach, and 25% to Dr. Marianne Kris, her psychoanalyst. A trust fund provided her mother, Gladys Baker Eley, with $5,000 a year. When Dr. Kris died in 1980, she passed her 25% on to the Anna Freud Centre, a children\'s psychiatric institute in London. Since Strasberg\'s death in 1982, his 75% has been administered by his widow, Anna, and her lawyer, Irving Seidman.      The licensing of Marilyn\'s name and likeness, handled world-wide by Curtis Management Group, reportedly nets the Monroe estate about $2 million a year.      Was named the Number One Sex Star of the 20th Century by Playboy magazine in 1999.      Started using the name Marilyn Monroe in 1946, but did not legally change it until 1956.      Appeared on the first cover of Playboy in 1953.      Given a dog she named Tippy by foster father Albert Bolender. In her final, unfinished film Something\'s Got to Give (1962), the dog was also named Tippy.      Interred at Westwood Memorial Park, Los Angeles, California, USA, in the Corridor of Memories, crypt #24.      Hundreds of items of memorabilia auctioned off in late October 1999 by Christie\'s, with her infamous \'JFK\' birthday-gown fetching over $1 million.      Chosen by Empire magazine as one of the 100 Sexiest Stars in film history (#2). [1995]Hugh M. Hefner owns the closest burial vault next to hers.      She was discovered dead at her home at 12305 Fifth Helena Drive, Brentwood, California. She had a phone in one of her hands, her body was completely nude and face down, on her bed.      Ex-husband Joe DiMaggio put fresh roses at her memorial site, for numerous years after her death.      When putting her imprints at Grauman\'s she joked that Jane Russell was best known for her large front-side and she was known for her wiggly walk, so Jane could lean over, and she could sit in it. It was only a joke, but she dotted the ""I"" in her name with a rhinestone, which was stolen within days.      Redheaded actress Tina Louise played the character role of Ginger Grant on the television series Gilligan\'s Island (1964), was loosely based on her personality, but a different hair color.      Her first modeling job paid only five dollars.      Frequently used Nivea moisturizer.      During the filming of Niagara (1953), she was still under contract as a stock actor, thus, she received less salary than her make-up man. This was also the only film in which her character died. The film was reworked to highlight her after Anne Bancroft withdrew.      Often carried around the book, ""The Biography of Abraham Lincoln.""      Was an outstanding player on the Hollygrove Orphanage softball team.      Because the bathing suit she wore in the movie Love Nest (1951) was so risque (for the time period) and caused such a commotion on the set, director Joseph M. Newman had to make it a closed set when she was filming.      Fearing blemishes and sweat, she washed her face fifteen times a day.      She was suggested as a possible wife for Prince Rainier of Monaco. But he picked actress, Grace Kelly, to be his wife.      Thought the right side of her face was her ""best"" side.      The first time she signed an autograph as Marilyn Monroe, she had to ask how to spell it. She didn\'t know where to put the ""i"" in ""Marilyn"".      Born on Tuesday at 9:30 AM, Pacific Standard Time, which is Los Angeles, California\'s time zone.      Suffered from endometriosis, a condition in which tissues of the uterus lining (endometrium) leave the uterus, attach themselves to other areas of the body, and grow, causing pain, irregular bleeding, and, in severe cases, infertility.      Divorced first husband, James Dougherty, in Las Vegas, Nevada.      Divorced last husband, Arthur Miller, in Juarez, Mexico.      Wore glasses.      On Thursday, February 23rd, 1956, she obtained order from the City Court of the State of New York to legally change her name from Norma Jeane Mortenson to Marilyn Monroe.      Married Arthur Miller twice: the 1st time in a civil ceremony, then in a Jewish (to which she had converted) ceremony two days later.      Won an interlocutory decree from Joe DiMaggio on Wednesday, October 27th, 1954, but, under California law, the divorce was not finalized until exactly one year later.      Offered to convert to Catholism in order to marry Joe DiMaggio in a Church ceremony, but she was turned down because she was divorced. Subsequently, when the divorced DiMaggio married Marilyn in a civil ceremony at San Francisco City Hall, he was automatically excommunicated by the Church; this edict was struck down by Pope John XXIII\'s Ecumenical Council (Vatican II) in 1962.      Although it\'s believed that her mother, Gladys Baker, named her after Norma Talmadge, Gladys reportedly told her daughter, Bernice (Marilyn\'s half-sister), that she named Marilyn after Norma Jeane Cohen, a child she was Nanny to while living in Louisville, KY. while her son Robert Kermit Baker (Marilyn\'s half brother) was in Hospital, and estranged from the father Jasper Baker. The boy died, and Gladys returned to California.      The first stamp released in the USPS\'s Legends of Hollywood series, issued on Friday, June 1st, 1995.      Went to Van Nuys High School (Los Angeles) in the early 1940s but never graduated.      In 1973, Elton John released a single in tribute to her entitled ""Candle in the Wind"". In 1997, it was re-recorded with updated lyrics in memory of Princess Diana, becoming the UK\'s best-selling single of all time. Def Leppard\'s single ""Photograph"" from their ""Pyromania"" album was also written about Monroe. Glenn Danzig, lead singer of the punk band The Misfits, recorded a song called ""Who Killed Marilyn?"", inspired by his belief that she had been murdered. She is mentioned in the lyrics of several other songs, including ""Celluloid Heroes"" by The Kinks, ""We Didn\'t Start the Fire"" by Billy Joel, ""Vogue"" by Madonna, ""Lady Nina"" by rock band Marillion and ""Tell Me It\'s Not True"" from the musical ""Blood Brothers"".      Her behavior on the unfinished Something\'s Got to Give (1962) dimmed her reputation in the industry, but she was still big box office at the time of her death. What a Way to Go! (1964) and The Stripper (1963) were being developed for her.      When she was told that she was not the star in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) she verbally said ""Well whatever I am, I\'m still the blonde."".      The famous nude photo of her by Tom Kelley originally appeared as anonymous on a calendar entitled ""Miss Golden Dreams."" In 1952, a blackmailer threatened to identify the model as Marilyn, but she shrewdly thwarted the scheme by announcing the fact herself. Hugh M. Hefner then bought the rights to use the photo for $500. She became ""The Sweetheart of the Month"" in the first issue of Hefner\'s magazine, Playboy. Neither Kelley or Monroe ever saw a dime of the millions the calendar made for its publisher.      Formed her own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions, with Milton H. Greene, on December 31, 1955.      Appears on sleeve of The Beatles\' ""Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band"" album.      Batman writer/artist Bob Kane used Marilyn\'s likeness as a reference when he drew Vicki Vale.      Her USO Entertainer Identification Card (#129778) listed her name as ""Norma Jeane DiMaggio"".      She was ""discovered"" by press photographers during a World War II photo shoot at the Radioplane plant in California owned by actor Reginald Denny. She was one of the plant\'s employees. She left her job and signed with Emmeline Snively\'s modeling agency.      Was referenced in the dialogue of La dolce vita (1960), in the context of dieting.      The Emily Ann Faulkner/Rita Shawn character (played by Kim Stanley) in the John Cromwell film The Goddess (1958) was based on her.      The first Playboy magazine cover, featuring her, is pictured on one of six stamps issued in a souvenir sheet, issued by Grenada & the Grenadines on Saturday, December 1st, 2003 to celebrate Playboy\'s 50th and golden anniversary.      When she wasn\'t acting, she preferred to wear nothing but a bathrobe and occasionally a bikini.      Named 2nd Greatest Movie Star of all time by Premier Magazine, behind #1 Cary Grant and before #3 Tom Cruise.      The punk band The Misfits created or picked their name from the last movie title she acted in, The Misfits (1961).      Featured on a 1.11 euro postage stamp issued by French Post Office on Saturday, November 8th, 2003.      The very popular version of ""Santa Baby"" (also found in the film, Party Monster (2003)) thought to be sung by her was instead recorded by Cynthia Basinet for Jack Nicholson as a Christmas gift.      Ten days in advance, on Saturday, May 19th, 1962, she performed for U.S. President John F. Kennedy at his 45th birthday tribute in his honor at Madison Square Garden. She sang ""Happy Birthday"". (Kennedy\'s real birthday was May 29th).      After discovering her dress was torn, at the 1950 Academy Awards, she burst into tears.      Was named #6 Actress on The American Film Institute\'s 50 Greatest Screen Legends.      The dress Marilyn Monroe wore to serenade John F. Kennedy, on May 19, 1962 at his birthday celebration was so tight, that it had to be sewn onto her. She had to sit still for approximately an hour.      In 1999, a make-up kit that she personally owned, sold for $266,500.      One of the first Los Angeles natives to become a major movie star.      Aside from her birth name of Norma Jeane Mortenson, she was baptized and mainly known throughout her life as Norma Jeane Baker. During her modeling days she was also known as Norma Jeane Dougherty (her first marriage name), and also as Jean Norman. When she signed with 20th Century-Fox, studio casting executive Ben Lyon had first chosen the name Carol Lind as her stage name, although she disliked that. Eventually she chose her mother\'s maiden name of Monroe. Three names were drawn up as possible stage names. The first was Norma Jeane Monroe, although that sounded awkward; the second was Jean Monroe, and the third was Marilyn Monroe, the latter first name being chosen by Lyon who thought Norma Jeane resembled famed stage actress Marilyn Miller. Norma Jeane liked Jean Monroe, for it preserved some of her name, but Lyon convinced her that Marilyn Monroe sounded more alliterative and so it was chosen.      She took acting lessons from Michael Chekhov.Sergei Parajanov made collages of Monroe, Charles Chaplin, Mona Lisa, and other famous personages and many were featured in Mikhail Vartanov\'s Parajanov: The Last Spring (1992).      A 1982 review into the original inquest of Marilyn\'s death, conducted on its 20-year anniversary, concluded that the actress committed suicide or accidentally overdosed, and was not murdered--rumors that were fueled by the sloppy handling of evidence, the delay in securing the scene and the disappearance of tissue samples.      The ADR stage at Twentieth Century Fox is named after her.      In 1972, actress Veronica Hamel and her husband became the new owners of Marilyn\'s Brentwood home. They hired a contractor to replace the roof and remodel the house, and the contractor discovered a sophisticated eavesdropping and telephone tapping system that covered every room in the house. The components were not commercially available in 1962, but were in the words of a retired Justice Department official, ""standard FBI issue."" This discovery lent further support to claims of conspiracy theorists that Marilyn had been under surveillance by the Kennedys and the Mafia. The new owners spent $100,000 to remove the bugging devices from the house.      Was good friends with Dorothy Dandridge and Ava Gardner when they were all young, struggling actresses in Hollywood.      When budding actresses Shelley Winters and Marilyn were roommates in the late 1940s in Hollywood, Shelley said that one day she had to step out and asked Marilyn to ""wash the lettuce"" for a salad they were to share for dinner. When Shelley got back to the apartment, (Marilyn was apparently new to the art of cooking) had the leaves of lettuce in a small tub of soapy water and was scrubbing them clean. She had not heard of the phrase before either, or did not know it\'s true meaning.      Her real father was Charles Stanley Gifford. From his side, she was descended from the founder of Rhode Island, Roger Williams, and religious leader Anne Marbury-Hutchinson, from whom she is related to Lucretia Rudolph (wife of President James A. Garfield), Grover Cleveland, William Howard Taft, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, George Bush, and George W. Bush.      In How to Marry a Millionaire (1953), her character Pola is reading a book called ""Murder By Strangulation"" on the plane. Coincidentally, this is how her character was murdered in Niagara (1953).      Friend of James Haspiel.Don\'t Bother to Knock (1952) (her 18th film) was an attempt to prove to critics that she could act successfully. Because some earlier films took numerous takes and much longer time to complete. Especially, The Seven Year Itch (1955) which took numerous extra takes, for her character role, alone.      In Italy, her films were dubbed at the beginning of her career by Miranda Bonansea. As she matured she was dubbed by the marvellous and prolific Rosetta Calavetta with immense success, particularly in Some Like It Hot (1959). Zoe Incrocci lent her voice to Monroe once: in All About Eve (1950).      Her lifelong bouts with depression and self-destruction took their toll during filming The Seven Year Itch (1955). She frequently muffed scenes and forgot her lines, leading to sometimes as many as 40 takes of a scene before a satisfactory result was produced. Her constant tardiness and behavioral problems made the budget of the film swell to $1.8 million, a high price for the time. The film still managed to make a nice profit. The classic shot of her dress blowing up around her legs as she stands over a subway grating in this film was originally shot on Manhattan\'s Lexington Avenue at 52nd St., On Wednesday, September 15th, 1954, at 1:00 a.m. Five thousand onlookers whistled and cheered through take after take as Marilyn repeatedly missed her lines. This occurred in presence of an increasingly embarrassed and angry Joe DiMaggio (her husband at the time; the nine-month-old marriage officially ended during the shooting of this film). The original footage shot on that night in New York never made it to the screen; the noise of the crowd had made it unusable. Director Billy Wilder re-shot the scene on the 20th Century-Fox lot, on a set replicating Lexington Avenue, and got a more satisfactory result. However, it took another 40 takes for Marilyn to achieve the famous scene. Amazingly, her very narrow spike heels don\'t get stuck or break in the subway grating, although this was a universal problem at the time for the countless women wearing that very popular style heel in New York City in that era. An important promotional campaign was released for this mainstream motion picture, including a 52-foot-high cutout of Marilyn (from the blowing dress scene) erected in front of Loews State Theater, in New York City\'s Times Square. The movie premiere was on June 1, 1955, which was also her 29th birthday.      Was originally set to play Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany\'s (1961), but Audrey Hepburn played the role instead.What a Way to Go! (1964) initially intended as a vehicle for her, Shirley MacLaine played Louisa May Foster instead. Producer Arthur P. Jacobs was her publicist and J. Lee Thompson was on her list of approved directors.      She resided at the Hollywood Roosevelt while she was breaking into the acting business.      Her ""Happy Birthday Mr. President"" dress sold for $1,267,500.00, a world record for the most expensive piece of clothing ever sold, and is in the Guinness Book of World Records.      She left Hollywood to pursue serious acting by studying under Lee Strasberg at his Actors\' Studio in New York City.      Her classic shape, according to her dressmaker, is actually measured at 37-23-36.      In 1946, she signed her first studio contract with 20th Century Fox and dyed her hair.      Spent most of her early childhood in foster homes and orphanages because her mother was committed to a mental institution. Later, she lived with her mother\'s best friend, Grace McKee, and her family. McKee, a big fan of Jean Harlow, allowed her to wear make-up and curl her hair and, when she was 15, it was McKee who pierced her ears for her using a sewing needle. At 16, when McKee could no longer take care of her, she got married to avoid returning to the orphanage.      Producer Keya Morgan owns her Bible.      When she married Joe DiMaggio, the couple moved into a home at 508 N. Palm Drive in Beverly Hills, that was next door to Jean Harlow\'s last home.      She tried 9 different shades of blonde hair color before settling on platinum blonde.      Her personal library contained over 400 books on topics ranging from art to history, psychology, philosophy, literature, religion, poetry, and gardening. Many of the volumes, auctioned in 1999, bore her pencil notations in the margins.      There are over 600 books written about her.      Nearly 11 years after her death, she appeared on the cover of the Tuesday, July 17th, 1973 edition of ""Time Magazine"" in a full-color portrait taken by Bert Stern, from the last photographic sitting before her death. The cover-story heralds the publication of ""Marilyn,"" the biography of her by Norman Mailer. On the cover, her image dwarfs a black & white photo of Mailer. Mailer reportedly was displeased that ""Time"" chose to play up Monroe and diminish him, visually on the cover. The publication of the coffee table biography, which contained many photographs including several by Stern, was a major event of that publishing season. The book retailed for $19.95, which is approximately $100 in 2008 money, when factored for inflation.      ""Time Magazine"" reported in 1973 that Los Angeles County coroner Thomas Noguchi, the doctor who performed Monroe\'s autopsy, said that contrary to rumors, Monroe\'s stomach was never pumped after her death. The level of Nembutal in her bloodstream was 4.5 milligrams per 100, which is the equivalent of 40 or 50 capsules indicating suicide.      In 1961, after her divorce from Arthur Miller, she purchased a 2900 square foot hacienda style house in Brentwood, for $77,500.      Featured in ""Femme Noir: Bad Girls of Film"" by Karen Burroughs Hannsberry (McFarland, 1998).      Her last film Something\'s Got to Give (1962), was finally released in 2003. In the swimming pool scene, Marilyn reveals much more to the camera than she did in her then controversial calendar photo from the early 1950s.      Was in consideration for the part of Adelaide in Guys and Dolls (1955), but Vivian Blaine was cast instead.      Although she was perhaps the most famous actress of the 1950s decade, she never made more than $100,000 per picture upfront. Actresses such as Elizabeth Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck were earning significantly more.      Former stepmother of Robert A. Miller.      Half-sister of Berniece and Robert Kermitt Baker (but she never knew him, because he died at 14) by her mother\'s side. Sister-in-law of Paris Miracle, aunt of Mona Rae Miracle.      Became pregnant twice (in July 1957 and November 1958) during her marriage to Arthur Miller; on both occasions she suffered miscarriages.      Although she was an avid buyer of books and owned over 400 of them at her death, third husband Arthur Miller said, ""Aside from Colette\'s Cheri and a few short stories, I had never known her to read anything all the way through. She felt she could get the idea of a book, and often did, in just a few pages."".      Read and wrote poetry.      Ranked #3 in Men\'s Health 100 Hottest Women of all Time (2011).      Was a lifelong liberal Democrat.      Was close friends with singer Ella Fitzgerald and helped her rise in her musical career by arranging for her to sing in many upscale nightclubs some of which were segregated during the time of their friendship.      Monroe was a stutterer, a little known fact that was easily covered thanks to studio vocal coaches who provided her with diction lessons.      Learned to play the guitar for her role in River of No Return (1954) and the ukulele for her role in Some Like It Hot (1959).      Former sister-in-law of Joan Copeland, Vince DiMaggio, and Dominic DiMaggio. She and Joan shared the same birthday (June 1).      Film editor Dann Cahn recommended a young woman he was dating for the part of a beautiful young woman in Your Show Time (1949). Producer Stanley Rubin auditioned her and turned her down because she did not have enough experience. The young woman\'s name was Marilyn Monroe.      She was scheduled for The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955), but she was thought too old at 30 when the character was supposed to be 17 so she was replaced with Joan Collins.      According to Adam Curtis\' ""The Century of Self"", Monroe was in the later years subjected to an experimental kind of therapy where she was forced to attend the rituals of an average family and then expected to model her self upon the experience. Arthur Miller commented in the same documentary ""I don\'t think suffering is always a mistake"".Ayn Rand wrote a powerful tribute to her, compiled in ""The Voice of Reason"".      Although Monroe\'s famous nude calender grossed $750,000, the actress only got $50 and a bad cold out of it.      After working with Monroe in As Young as You Feel (1951) jealous co-star Constance Bennett wisecracked, ""Now there\'s a broad with a future behind her!"".      Among roles that Monroe turned down under her Fox contract: ""Pink Tights,"" ""How To Be Very, Very Popular,"" ""The Revolt of Mamie Stover,"" ""The Girl in the Red velvet Swing,\' ""The Jean Harlow Story,"" ""The Blue Angel,"" and ""Can-Can."".      She campaigned to play the Maria Schell role in ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" but she was never seriously considered.      According to the book ""Flesh and Fantasy"" Monroe perfected a Vaseline-based lip gloss.      ""Goodbye, Charlie"" with Debbie Reynolds, and ""The Stripper"" with Joanne Woodward were originally slated by Fox as Monroe projects.      Director Billy Wilder was quoted as saying, ""The great success of Monroe... was that she did not infuriate the female."".      Was good friends with Judy Garland.      Played by Mary Hanson in Hollywood Mouth 2 (2014). The director of that film, Jordan Mohr, had portrayed Marilyn\'s rival Simone Signoret in the stage play ""Two Simones: de Beauvoir and Signoret in Hollywood"".      Richard Widmark on co-starring with Monroe in ""Don\'t Bother to Knock"": ""She was a vulnerable kid. Murder to work with because she was scared to death of acting - even when she became a big movie actress. We had a hell of a time getting her out of the dressing room. When it was five o\'clock , it got irritating: \'C\'mon, Marilyn, we want to go home!\' She was a movie animal. Something happened between the lens and the film. Nobody knew what the hell it was. On the set, you\'d think: \'Oh, this is impossible; you can\'t print this.\' You\'d see it, and she\'s got everyone backed off the screen. Olivier said the same thing. She had that phenomenal something! Nobody knows what it is, but she had it. She certainly was never a professional actress. She always had a coach with her, lurking in the background, giving her signals. And she could never remember three words in a row - so it was all piece-work. Beyond all the technical deficiencies, she was a nice girl. We got along fine."".      Is one of 20 actresses who did not receive an Oscar nomination for their Best Actress in a Comedy/Musical Golden Globe-winning performance; hers being for Some Like It Hot (1959). The others, in chronological order, are: June Allyson for Too Young to Kiss (1951), Ethel Merman for Call Me Madam (1953), Jean Simmons for Guys and Dolls (1955), Taina Elg and Kay Kendall for Les Girls (1957), Rosalind Russell for A Majority of One (1961) and Gypsy (1962), Patty Duke for Me, Natalie (1969), Twiggy for The Boy Friend (1971), Raquel Welch for The Three Musketeers (1973), Barbra Streisand for A Star Is Born (1976), Bernadette Peters for Pennies from Heaven (1981), Kathleen Turner for Romancing the Stone (1984) and Prizzi\'s Honor (1985), Miranda Richardson for Enchanted April (1991), Jamie Lee Curtis for True Lies (1994), Nicole Kidman for To Die For (1995), Madonna for Evita (1996), Renée Zellweger for Nurse Betty (2000), Sally Hawkins for Happy-Go-Lucky (2008), and Amy Adams for Big Eyes (2014).      Egypt banned all her films after her conversion to Judaism in 1956.      One of Hajime Sorayama\'s ""Gynoids"" is based on her iconic pose from ""The Seven Year Itch"".      In order to fall asleep quicker and stay asleep longer she often mixed champagne with sleeping pills.      Became friends with Exotic Animal Trainer Ralph Helfer while working together in the movie River of No Return (1954) and got very attached to his Raccoon named Bandit.      In November 2016, the dress worn by Monroe while singing ""Happy Birthday"" to President John F. Kennedy at his 1962 birthday celebration was sold for $4.8 million, a record amount for a dress sold at auction. This surpassed the previous record for a dress sold at auction, which was also held by a dress worn by Monroe: the white dress she wore in The Seven Year Itch (1955) fetched $4.6 million in 2011.      Marilyn Monroe was 36 when she was found dead in her Beverly Hills-West Hollywood home on an early Sunday morning, August 5, 1962, just less than two and a half months after she appeared at New York City\'s Madison Square Garden, on a Saturday evening, May 19, 1962. The event was staged and produced by Broadway composer and lyricist Richard Adler. It was choreographed by Carol Haney of ""The Pajama Game"" fame. The Democratic event rally was a fund raising gala for the Democratic Party, the evening\'s program highlight, a celebration of John F. Kennedy\'s forty-fifth birthday, ten days before his actual birth-date on Tuesday, May 29, 1962, before 15,000 invited guests, Marilyn Monroe to sing ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President"" to President John F. Kennedy. Monroe sang the traditional ""Happy Birthday to You"" lyrics in a sultry, intimate voice, with ""Mr. President"" inserted as Kennedy\'s name. She continued the song with a snippet from the classic song, ""Thanks for the Memory"", for which she had written new lyrics specifically aimed at Kennedy. ""Thanks, Mr. President, For all the things you\'ve done, The battles that you\'ve won, The way you deal with U.S. Steel, And our problems by the ton, We thank you so much."" That moment in New York City, as we look back on it today in a grainy video, is frozen in time with all its possibilities still before it. We see celebration, joy, life. And we know too much about the future. Maybe that\'s why the gown Marilyn wore is worth $4.8 million. Because people will line up to see it, to stand next to something that once sparkled in the presence of greatness, of triumph, of happiness. The gown that broke the November 2016 auction record, was a creation of Hollywood film costume designer Jean Louis, with the original sketch executed by 19 year old costume illustrator Bob Mackie. Made of sheer silk marquisette-gauze fabric, the flesh-colored gown was hand-sewn with over 2,500 rhinestone-crystals, originally cost $1,440.33. It was tailored by an atelier so close to the body that Monroe was sewn into it before she walked onto the stage. The dress sold in 1999 at an auction in New York for over US $1.26 million. A new bidder subsequently purchased the dress in November 17, 2016. Peter Lawford was at the event that night to introduce Monroe. He made a play on the actress\'s reputation for tardiness by giving her a number of introductions throughout the night, building anticipation, after which she did not appear on stage. When Monroe finally appeared in a spotlight, Lawford introduced her as the ""late Marilyn Monroe"". Monroe peeled off her white ermine fur coat, revealing the dress, and the audience gasped. The film video of the event when actor Peter Lawford includes the downright eerie introduction of Monroe\'s missed cue for her entrance. ""Mr. President,"" Lawford says, leaning into the microphone, ""the LATE Marilyn Monroe."" As Lawford takes her white ermine coat, a thousand voices in the audience let out a gasp of ""Oh!"" at the sight of the gown, and the woman underneath it. According to Los Angeles\' Julien\'s Auctions, Marilyn was the only thing underneath the sheer gown, the dress was so tight that Monroe wore nothing else. Rumors of an affair between the president and the film star were sparked by the absence of Jacqueline Kennedy from the 45th birthday celebration, and by the sultry and suggestive performance. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who rarely attended Democratic Party events, spent the day at the Loudon Hunt Horse Show with her children John-John and Caroline. ""I can now retire from politics after having had \'Happy Birthday\' sung to me in such a sweet, wholesome manner,"" alluding to Marilyn\'s delivery, skintight dress, and image as a sex symbol, JFK said, when he stood alone at the lectern a few minutes later. Monroe had been spirited away from the microphone while the cameras were distracted by the entrance of an enormous birthday cake carried in on the shoulders of two men in chefs\' jackets. The November, 2016, buyer Ripley\'s Entertainment Inc., the company that operates ""Ripley\'s Believe It or Not! Museum"" in Hollywood, California, paid $4.8 million at auction. The company plans to display the dress there and also take it on tour. In 2017, Ripley\'s is celebrating its 100th year anniversary, and the ""Marilyn Monroe\'s \'Happy Birthday, Mr. President\' gown"" will be prominently featured, as it should be. Surviving to 100 and still overspending on dresses is something to celebrate. JFK was assassinated at age 46, eighteen months later after his Madison Square Garden 45th ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President"" birthday celebration, at 12:30pm Central Time, on a Friday noon motorcade parade, November 22, 1963, in Dealy Plaza in Dallas, Texas.      Subject of song ""Marilyn Monroe"" by Phoebe Legere.      Born on the same day as Andy Griffith.Personal Quotes (116)      I love a natural look in pictures. I like people with a feeling one way or another - it shows an inner life. I like to see that there\'s something going on inside them.      My problem is that I drive myself... I\'m trying to become an artist, and to be true, and sometimes I feel I\'m on the verge of craziness, I\'m just trying to get the truest part of myself out, and it\'s very hard. There are times when I think, \'All I have to be is true\'. But sometimes it doesn\'t come out so easily. I always have this secret feeling that I\'m really a fake or something, a phony.      [on living with the Bolenders when she was a little girl] They were terribly strict. They didn\'t mean any harm . . . it was their religion. They brought me up harshly.      [on meeting Joe DiMaggio for the first time] I was surprised to be so crazy about Joe. I expected a flashy New York sports type, and instead I met this reserved guy who didn\'t make a pass at me right away! He treated me like something special. Joe is a very decent man, and he makes other people feel decent, too.      [on why Joe DiMaggio didn\'t accompany her on one of her USO tours] Joe hates crowds and glamor.      [on why she divorced James Dougherty] My marriage didn\'t make me sad, but it didn\'t make me happy either. My husband and I hardly spoke to each other. This wasn\'t because we were angry. We had nothing to say. I was dying of boredom.      [on why her marriage to Joe DiMaggio didn\'t work] I didn\'t want to give up my career, and that\'s what Joe wanted me to do most of all.      I want to be a big star more than anything. It\'s something precious.      [on her favorite actress] Jean Harlow was my idol.      [on drifting in and out of orphanages when she was little] The world around me then was kind of grim. I had to learn to pretend in order to - I don\'t know - block the grimness. The whole world seemed sort of closed to me . . . [I felt] on the outside of everything, and all I could do was to dream up any kind of pretend game.      [on her early marriage to James Dougherty] Grace McKee arranged the marriage for me, I never had a choice. There\'s not much to say about it. They couldn\'t support me, and they had to work out something. And so I got married.      I\'m not interested in money, I just want to be wonderful.      A career is wonderful, but you can\'t curl up with it on a cold night.      Sometimes I think it would be easier to avoid old age, to die, young, but then you\'d never complete your life, would you? You\'d never wholly know yourself...      A dollar for your thoughts...      I\'ve been on a calendar, but never on time.      No one ever told me I was pretty when I was a little girl. All little girls should be told they\'re pretty, even if they aren\'t.      In Hollywood a girl\'s virtue is much less important than her hairdo. You\'re judged by how you look, not by what you are. Hollywood\'s a place where they\'ll pay you a thousand dollars for kiss, and fifty cents for your soul. I know, because I turned down the first offer often enough and held out for the fifty.      Dogs never bite me. Just humans.      Sex is a part of nature. I go along with nature.      Fame will go by and, so long, I\'ve had you, Fame. If it goes by, I\'ve always known it was fickle.      I knew I belonged to the public and to the world, not because I was talented or even beautiful, but because I never had belonged to anything or anyone else.      People had a habit of looking at me as if I were some kind of mirror instead of a person. They didn\'t see me, they saw their own lewd thoughts, then they white-masked themselves by calling me the lewd one.      A sex-symbol becomes a thing, I just hate being a thing. But if I\'m going to be a symbol of something I\'d rather have it sex than some other things we\'ve got symbols of.      The truth is I\'ve never fooled anyone. I\'ve let people fool themselves. They didn\'t bother to find out who and what I was. Instead they would invent a character for me. I wouldn\'t argue with them. They were obviously loving somebody I wasn\'t. When they found this out, they would blame me for disillusioning them---and fooling them.      To put it bluntly, I seem to have a whole superstructure with no foundation. But I\'m working on the foundation.      If I had observed all the rules, I\'d never have gotten anywhere.      I want to grow old without face-lifts... I want to have the courage to be loyal to the face that I have made.      It\'s often just enough to be with someone. I don\'t need to touch them. Not even talk. A feeling passes between you both. You\'re not alone.      I\'m a failure as a woman. My men expect so much of me, because of the image they\'ve made of me and that I\'ve made of myself, as a sex symbol. Men expect so much, and I can\'t live up to it.      It stirs up envy, fame does. People you run into feel that, well, who does she think she is, Marilyn Monroe? They feel fame gives them some kind of privilege to walk up to you and say anything to you, you know, of any kind of nature - and it won\'t hurt your feelings.      Fame is fickle, and I know it. It has it\'s compensations but it also has it\'s drawbacks, and I\'ve experienced them both.      My illusions didn\'t have anything to do with being a fine actress. I knew how third rate I was. I could actually feel my lack of talent, as if it were cheap clothes I was wearing inside. But my God, how I wanted to learn, to change, to improve!      If I play a stupid girl, and ask a stupid question, I\'ve got to follow it through. What am I supposed to do, look intelligent?      [on her famous nude calendar pose in 1949] My sin has been no more than I have written, posing for the nude because I desperately needed 50 dollars to get my car out of hock.      An actor is supposed to be a sensitive instrument. Isaac Stern takes good care of his violin. What if everyone jumped on his violin?      There was my name up in lights. I said, ""God, somebody\'s made a mistake!"" But there it was in lights. And I sat there and said, ""Remember, you\'re not a star"". Yet there it was up in lights.      Some people have been unkind. If I say I want to grow as an actress, they look at my figure. If I say I want to develop, to learn my craft, they laugh. Somehow they don\'t expect me to be serious about my work.      I was never used to being happy, so that wasn\'t something I ever took for granted. I did sort of think, you know, marriage did that. You see, I was brought up differently from the average American child because the average child is brought up expecting to be happy - that\'s it, successful, happy, and on time.      You know, when you grow up you can get kind of sour, I mean, that\'s the way it can go.      Wouldn\'t it be nice to be like men and get notches in your belt and sleep with most attractive men and not get emotionally involved?      I used to think as I looked at the Hollywood night, ""There must be thousands of girls sitting alone like me, dreaming of becoming a movie star. But I\'m not going to worry about them. I\'m dreaming the hardest.""      The trouble with censors is they worry if a girl has cleavage. They ought to worry if she hasn\'t any.      I used to say to myself, ""What the devil have you got to be proud about, Marilyn Monroe?"" And I\'d answer, ""Everything, everything"".      [on stardom] It scares me. All those people I don\'t know, sometimes they\'re so emotional. I mean, if they love you that much without knowing you, they can also hate you the same way.      [Johann Wolfgang von Goethe] said, ""Talent is developed in privacy"", you know? And it\'s really true. There is a need for aloneness which I don\'t think most people realize for an actor. It\'s almost having certain kinds of secrets for yourself that you\'ll let the whole world in on only for a moment, when you\'re acting.      I want to be an artist, an actress with integrity.      I\'ve never dropped anyone I believed in.      [on John F. Kennedy] It would be so nice to have a president who looks so young and good-looking.      I restore myself when I\'m alone. A career is born in public -- talent in private.      Talent is developed in privacy... but everybody is always tugging at you. They\'d all like sort of a chunk at you. They\'d kind of like to take pieces out of you.      I want to be an artist... not an erotic freak. I don\'t want to be sold to the public as a celluloid aphrodisiacal.      [about Montgomery Clift] He\'s the only person I know that is in worse shape than I am.      I\'ve never liked the name Marilyn. I\'ve often wished that I had held out that day for Jean Monroe. But I guess it\'s too late to do anything about it now.      [on Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift] Marlon\'s kinda hard to tie down, they say. He\'s never sure what he wants to do. He and Monty Clift have a lot in common, though they\'re totally different people, but they don\'t plan their careers too well and they\'re not ambitious enough for their talents.      Personally, I react to Marlon Brando. He\'s a favorite of mine.      [on Frank Sinatra] He is a man at the top of his profession and is a fine actor as well. You know, he got an Oscar for From Here to Eternity (1953). He has helped more people anonymously than anybody else. And the miserable press smears him with lies about his being involved with the Mafia and gangsters. And Frank just takes it.      [on Mae West] A nice lady even though she turned down making a picture with me. That just shows how smart she is.      Speaking of Oscars, I would win overwhelmingly if the Academy gave an Oscar for faking orgasms. I have done some of my best acting convincing my partners I was in the throes of ecstasy.      [on Laurence Olivier on the set of The Prince and the Showgirl (1957)] Olivier came into my dressing room to give me hell for screwing up. I soothed him by telling him I thought his Hamlet (1948) was one of the greatest films ever made. You know he won an Oscar for it.      When Clark Gable died, I cried for 2 days straight. I couldn\'t eat or sleep.      [on Sigmund Freud] I read his ""Introductory Lectures,"" God, what a genius. He makes it so understandable. And he is so right. Didn\'t he say himself that [William Shakespeare] and [Fyodor Dostoevsky] had a better understanding of psychology than all the scientists put together? Damn it, they do.      [on James Joyce and the character of Molly Bloom in Ulysses] Here is Joyce writing what a woman thinks to herself. Can he, does he really know her innermost thoughts? But after I read the whole book, I could better understand that Joyce is an artist who could penetrate the souls of people, male or female. It really doesn\'t matter that Joyce doesn\'t have...or never felt a menstrual cramp. To me Leopold Bloom is a central character. He is the despised Irish Jew, married to an Irish Catholic woman. It is through them Joyce develops much of what he wants to say. Do you agree that the scene where Bloom is looking at the little girl on the swing is the most erotic in the book?      [on John F. Kennedy] When he has finished his achievements, he will take his place with Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and [Franklin D. Roosevelt] as one of our greatest Presidents. I\'m glad he has [Robert F. Kennedy]. It\'s like the Navy. The President is the Captain and Bobby is his Executive Officer. Bobby would do absolutely anything for his brother. And so would I. I\'ll never embarrass him. As long as I have memory, I have John Fitzgerald Kennedy.      [on Sunday being the loneliest day of the week for her] All the men I know are spending the day with their wives and families, and all the stores in Los Angeles are closed. You can\'t wander through looking at all the pretty clothes and pretending to buy something.      [on Marlon Brando] He\'s very sweet and tender, not at all the Stanley Kowalski rapist people think he is.Arthur Miller wouldn\'t have married me if I had been nothing but a dumb blonde.      I have always been deeply terrified to really be someone\'s wife since I know from life one cannot love another, ever, really.      [on Peter Lawford] I have a need to be frightened and nothing really in my personal relationships and dealings lately have been frightening me, except for him. I felt very uneasy at different times with him, the real reason I was afraid of him is because I believe him to be homosexual...Peter wants to be a woman and would like to be me, I think.      Hollywood is a place where they\'ll pay you $50,000 for a kiss and 50c for your soul.      It\'s better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone.      It was the creative part that kept me going, trying to be an actress. I enjoy acting when you really hit it right.      I did what they said and all it got me was a lot of abuse. Everyone\'s just laughing at me. I hate it. Big breasts, big ass, big deal.      [on Arthur Miller\'s script for \'The Misfits\'] Arthur did this to me. He could have written anything and he comes up with this. If that\'s what he thinks of me, well, then I\'m not for him and he\'s not for me. Arthur says it\'s his movie. I don\'t think he even wants me in it.      I won\'t be satisfied until people want to hear me sing without looking at me.      The body is meant to be seen, not all covered up.      I love to do things that censors won\'t pass.      I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they\'re right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.      I have feelings too. I am still human. All I want is to be loved, for myself and for my talent.      I knew I belonged to the public and to the world, not because I was talented or even beautiful, but because I had never belonged to anything or anyone else.      Boys think girls are like books, If the cover doesn\'t catch their eye they won\'t bother to read what\'s inside.      [on shooting the famous scene in The Seven Year Itch (1955) where wind from the subway beneath blows her skirt up] At first it was all innocent and fun, but when Billy Wilder kept shooting the scene over and over the crowd of men kept on applauding and shouting, \'More, more Marilyn - let\'s see more.\' What was supposed to be a fun scene turned into a sex scene.      I\'ve often stood silent at a party for hours listening to my movie idols turn into dull and little people.      When you\'re young and healthy you can plan on Monday to commit suicide, and by Wednesday you\'re laughing again.      Suicide is a person\'s privilege. I don\'t believe it\'s a sin or a crime, it\'s your right if you do. Though it doesn\'t get you anywhere.      The other girls rode to school in a bus. I had no nickel to pay for the ride. Rain or shine, I walked the two miles from my ""aunt\'s"" home to the school. I hated the walk, I hated the school. I had no friends. The pupils seldom talked to me and never wanted me in their games. Nobody ever walked home with me or invited me to visit their homes. This was partly because I came from the poor part of the district where all the Mexicans and Japanese lived. It was also because I couldn\'t smile at anyone.      How or why I can act - and I\'m not sure I can - is the thing for me to understand. The torture, let alone the day to day happenings - the pain one cannot explain to another.      Executives can get colds and stay home and phone in - but the actor? How dare you get a cold or a virus! I wish they had to act a comedy with a temperature and a virus infection! I\'m there to give a performance, not to be disciplined by a studio. This isn\'t supposed to be a military school, after all.      [on homosexuality] No sex is wrong if there\'s love involved.      As long as I can remember, I\'ve always loved people.      What the world really needs is a real feeling of kinship. Everybody: stars, laborers, Negroes, Jews, Arabs. We are all brothers. Please don\'t make me a joke. End the interview with what I believe.      People always ask me if I believe diamonds are a girl\'s best friend. Frankly, I don\'t.      I have favorite motion-picture stars, like everyone else. You know who mine are? My favorite is Marlon Brando. I mean, really, I believe we\'d be an interesting combination. I\'ve said that about Marlon for a long time, but we haven\'t found the right story. Can you imagine us on the big screen? I hope something happens soon. Greta Garbo, I\'ve never met her. It really bugs me when I miss one of her films on TV. Oh, if you could only get me to meet her! I\'ve also heard wonderful things about Jeanne Eagels and Laurette Taylor. And the one they called the Blond Bombshell: Jean Harlow. Kay Kendall was a great comedian. She was really talented. I would have loved working with Gerard Philipe, the handsome French star- his films I\'ve been told were a huge success in France, as were his stage plays. I was told he wanted to make films with me. Oh, what a shame we never got the opportunity. We would have made an interesting team. What a shame. He was so young to die; he was thirty-six. He had been ill and apparently died of a heart attack.      Nearly everyone I knew talked to me about God. They always warned me not to offend Him.      Drugs pull you down and shut the lid on life. Pot opens everything up. All the anxieties, the creepy crawly blues, it all just drifts away and you can slowly remember what it feels like to be alive. Even more importantly, you can take a step back from the crap that\'s flying and see what really is important, which of the many things in your life really deserves worrying about. Not much!      [why she converted to Judaism] I believe in everything a little, and if I have kids, I think they should be Jewish. Anyway, I can identify with the Jews. Everybody\'s out to get them no matter what they do.      It might be kind of a relief to be finished. It\'s sort of like you don\'t know what kind of a yard dash you\'re running, but then you\'re at the finish line and you sort of sigh - you\'ve made it! But you never have. You have to start all over again.      I think that sexuality is only attractive when it\'s natural and spontaneous.      I sleep in the nude but I pull the sheets up.      When it comes down to it, I let them think what they want. If they care enough to bother with what I do, then I\'m already better than them.      I remember when I got the part in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Jane Russell, she was the brunette in it and I was the blonde. She got $200,000 for it, and I got my $500 a week, but that to me was, you know, considerable. She, by the way, was quite wonderful to me. The only thing was I couldn\'t get a dressing room. I said, finally, I really got to this kind of level, I said, ""Look, after all, I am the blonde, and it is Gentlemen Prefer Blondes!"" Because still they always kept saying, ""Remember, you\'re not a star."" I said, ""Well, whatever I am, I am the blonde!""      Who said nights were for sleep?      We are all born sexual creatures, thank God, but it\'s a pity so many people despise and crush this natural gift.      I\'m for the individual as opposed to the corporation. The way it is the individual is the underdog, and with all the things a corporation has going for them the individual comes out banged on her head. The artist is nothing. It\'s really tragic.      People had a habit of looking at me like I was some kind of mirror instead of a person. They didn\'t see me, they saw their own lewd thoughts, then they white-masked themselves by calling me the lewd one.      For the first family I lived with, to go to a movie was a sin. Every night I was told to pray that I would not wake up in hell.      There is nothing positive about being fat. And there is nothing positive about loving yourself. We all need to conform to society\'s expectations of who we are and if we don\'t, who will? Life is more enjoyable when you are thin and pretty. I was never fat a day in my life and I never will.      Creativity has got to start with humanity and when you\'re a human being, you feel, you suffer.      Fame is like caviar. It\'s good to have caviar, but not every damned day!      Let yourself go, the pleasure of physical movement is so important. If that\'s a problem, you say to yourself, what is there that I am afraid of, or hiding? Maybe your libido!      I have always felt comfortable in blue jeans. I have found it interesting, however, that people also whistle at blue jeans. I have to admit that I like mine to fit. There\'s nothing I hate worse than baggy blue jeans.      I want the world to see my body.      Men who think that a woman\'s past love affairs lessen her love for them are stupid. A woman can bring a new love to each man that she loves, providing that there are not too many.      The public doesn\'t mind people living together without being married, providing they don\'t overdo it.      Imperfection is beauty, madness is genius, it\'s better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring.      To everyone who thinks they\'re ugly because they\'re not a size 0, you\'re the beautiful one and it\'s society that\'s ugly.Salary (19)The Shocking Miss Pilgrim\xa0(1947)      $75 /week      Dangerous Years\xa0(1947)      $75 /week      Scudda Hoo!

She made her cinema debut in Don\'t Bother to Knock (1952) in 1952 and over the next five years appeared in a lot of undistinguished movies as a supporting actress, such as Gorilla at Large (1954), New York Confidential (1955) and The Girl in Black Stockings (1957). By 1957 she had grown dissatisfied with the roles she was getting, left the film industry and spent the next five years doing plays on Broadway. She returned to the screen in 1962 with her portrayal of Annie Sullivan in The Miracle Worker (1962), for which she won an Oscar. Bancroft went on to give acclaimed performances in The Pumpkin Eater (1964), The Slender Thread (1965), Young Winston (1972), The Prisoner of Second Avenue (1975), The Elephant Man (1980), To Be or Not to Be (1983), 84 Charing Cross Road (1987) and other movies as lead actress, but her most famous role would be as Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate (1967). Her status as the predatory ""older woman"" in the film is iconic, although in real life she was just 36 and only six years older than co-star Dustin Hoffman. Bancroft would later express her frustration over the fact that the film overshadowed her other work. Selective for much of her intermittent career, she appeared on the screen more frequently in the \'90s, playing a range of characters in such films as Love Potion No. 9 (1992), Point of No Return (1993), Home for the Holidays (1995), G.I. Jane (1997), Great Expectations (1998) and Up at the Villa (2000). She also started to make some TV films, including Deep in My Heart (1999) for which she won an Emmy. Sadly, on June 6, 2005, Bancroft passed away at the age of 73 from uterine cancer. Her death surprised many, as she had not revealed any information of her illness to the public. Among her survivors was her husband of 41 years, Mel Brooks, and her only child, Max Brooks, who was born in 1972. Her final film, the animated feature Delgo (2008), was released posthumously in 2008 and dedicated to her memory.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Volker Boehm          Spouse (2) Mel Brooks (5 August\xa01964            - 6 June\xa02005)\xa0(her death)\xa0(1 child)                         Martin May          (1 July\xa01953            - 13 February\xa01957)\xa0(divorced)          Trade Mark (2)        In most of her films, she habitually removes an earring before answering a telephone        Husky resonant voiceTrivia (58)      Was a leading choice to play Aurora Greenway in Terms of Endearment (1983). The part went to Shirley MacLaine, who won a Best Actress Oscar for her performance.      Was offered the role of Chris MacNeil in The Exorcist (1973), but had to turn it down because she was pregnant. The part went to Ellen Burstyn.      She and Mel Brooks met on the set of a talk show, and Mel later paid a woman who worked on the show to tell him which restaurant Anne was going to eat at that night so he could ""accidentally"" bump into her again and strike up a conversation.      Graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan.      She and Mel Brooks married at New York City Hall, where a passer-by served as their witness.

March 2005: First grandchild, Henry Michael Brooks, born.      1987: Was booked to appear on the British chat show Wogan (1982). In the green room five minutes before airtime, host Terry Wogan informed her that the show was live. According to Wogan she turned a deathly shade of pale and said she never did live television. In order to calm her down, Wogan suggested that she count 1, 2, 3... before walking on. When she was called onto the set, she could quite noticeably be seen counting whilst walking to her seat. She remained very uncomfortable and all her answers were monosyllabic. Wogan still says she was his most difficult guest.      She was less than 6 years older than Dustin Hoffman, although in The Graduate (1967) her character is supposed to be more than twice his age. She was only 8 years older than Katharine Ross, who played her daughter in the film.      She said that at the start of her career, 20th Century Fox thought that her real name--Anna Maria Italiano--was ""too ethnic"", and gave her several options for a new one. She chose Bancroft because she thought it sounded dignified.      She, Mel Brooks and their son Max Brooks all are Emmy-winners.      Her performance as Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate (1967) is ranked #47 on Premiere Magazine\'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.

Life is here only to be lived so that we can, through life, earn the right to death, which to me is paradise. Whatever it is that will bring me the reward of paradise, I\'ll do the best I can.      The best way to get most husbands to do something is to suggest that perhaps they\'re too old to do it.      When [Mel Brooks] told his Jewish mother he was marrying an Italian girl, she said: ""Bring her over. I\'ll be in the kitchen - with my head in the oven"".      [of her Mrs. Robinson role in The Graduate (1967)] Film critics said I gave a voice to the fear we all have: that we\'ll reach a point in our lives, look around and realize that all the things we said we\'d do and become will never come to be - and that we\'re ordinary.      [from 1984] The only reason I\'m still not doing ""Daughter of Gorilla at Large"" is because my personal life had become a shambles. Every picture I did was worse than the last one and every man I was in love with was worse than the last one. I was terribly immature. I was going steadily downhill in terms of self-respect and dignity.      [on John Ford] Marvelous but loony, tearing out pages of the script everywhere.      [1962] When I arrived in town, the movie industry was looking for sexpot glamor girls. I didn\'t qualify. Nor was I ever offered a top-flight movie. But there isn\'t any bitterness on my part. I wasn\'t as good an actress then as I am now.      [on being married to Mel Brooks] When he comes home at night and I hear his key in the lock, I say to myself, ""Oh good! The party\'s about to begin"".      I can sit with anybody in a room for an hour, and by the time they leave, automatically I will know the way they talk and the way they move. That\'s my special art.      When I was in radio, I was Anna St. Raymond; when I was in television, I was Anne Marno; and then in movies I was Anne Bancroft -- if I ever go into burlesque, I\'ve got one picked out: Ruby Pepper.      [Driving to Mexico City for a film] When I was in Mexico on location we had this long drive from the bottom of a mountain all the way to Mexico City. I used to get pretty bored on these drives, so I was shouting out the window, \'Hello, you people - Here I am! You lucky people you!\' So then five guys in this car followed us all the way to the hotel! That\'s the only funny thing that happened to me back then, only it wasn\'t in Hollywood - it was Mexico. Nothing funny happens in Hollywood.      [on her days as a contract player at Fox] I was seduced by every script. I thought every picture was the best, and that I was Greta Garbo.

This is an odd film, if only for its credits. It was written by Daniel
Taradash, a first-rate screenwriter who the next year would write the
screenplay for From Here To Eternity. The director, Englishman Roy Ward
Baker, had a varied and eclectic career, mostly in his native country,
where he directed, among other films, A Night To Remember and
Quatermass and the Pit. Screen sexpot Marilyn Monroe plays a psychotic
babysitter who encounters a tough-minded and cynical airline pilot and
causes him to change his outlook. Miss Monroe was not known for doing
drama, which she plays here, in black and white no less, and is
excellent. But that this was one of her first starring roles she seems
a peculiar choice to play the troubled young woman. Richard Widmark,
often a bad guy, is here only partly bad, and is proficient but rather
dull and, for him, colorless. Dramatic actress Anne Bancroft plays a
singer, and Widmark's girl, a role one might have expected Marilyn to
play. And so it goes. <br><br>The movie is compelling, if never really entertaining, and seems at
times as confused as Monroe's babysitter as to what sort of film it
wants to be. It is a bit of a psychological drama, a bit of a thriller.
filmed like a noir, studio-bound, which makes it also unrealistic, it
is in many respects a mess, but a watchable one. The central set of the
hotel in which nearly all the action takes place, is impressive, as are
the various characters who either live, visit or work there, who at
times seem like inhabitants of an enormous cave or reef, and as such
denizens of the place rather than employees or guests. There is a nice
sense of how dull night life can be in the heart of a supposedly
exciting city (New York). There are no especially good or bad people in
the film; just those who understand Monroe's plight, and empathize with
her, and those that don't. Young Marilyn more than rises to the
dramatic occasion, however, and gives a fine performance, far more
worthy than the script, and more animated than her co-stars, and in the
end steals the film and our hearts.

What's interesting about this movie is that it's so disturbing. Considered a
minor film in Monroe's canon, it's uncomfortable to watch now that we're so
saturated with information about her unhappy life. She plays a woman who's
had a nervous breakdown because she tried to escape a miserable family life
by falling for a young fighter pilot. They had sex in a hotel before
marriage, then he went away and got killed in the war and she tried to slash
her wrists. So her folks put her away in a funny farm, and now she's come
out to live in the city with her uncle, who reminds her of her
unsympathetic, impatient parents. That's dark territory for Monroe, and you
can't help wondering what she thought of the role. In any case, it's rather
uncanny to watch her breaking down. She abuses the girl she is babysitting
by tying her up, and at one point she says tellingly about the crying girl
""They stop if you ignore them."" We are left to conclude that this is how she
herself has been treated. In a later speech to the girl, she identifies
herself and her goals with the girl and her goals. ""We can all get what we
want and live happily ever after, understand?"" But she does not play a
psychopath, as her role is so often described. In the opinion of Widmark,
whose character matures and deepens through his encounter with her, she's
just a mixed-up girl who ""would never have hurt that kid."" Although Widmark
has a soberly happy ending, Monroe does not.

to be absolutely honest, marilyn monroe acted extremely well in this film.
I
think it was the first i had everseen of her (2001) and after all i had
heard about her acting as a ""blonde bombshell"" this picture sent me in
another direction. SHE CAN ACT!! to see marilyn play a psychotic woman may
not have been completely hard for her (no offense intended) but i feel it
was superb acting!  Ashame she wasnt offered more roles like this
one

This psychological suspense flick was one of Marilyn's first leading roles
and gave the sexy star an opportunity to play a serious dramatic role.
Viewers who have never seen the great Monroe in a serious part will be
amazed. She really was a very gifted and versatile actress. Sincerely, if
you have ever dismissed Monroe as just another pretty face, you should
really see this film. If after that you're still not convinced, then rent

This film doesn't receive a lot of attention. I grew up a fan of
classic film, and I only saw this one once until tonight. Seeing it for
the second time (I can't imagine there are any other major-release MM
films I haven't seen over &amp; over) I was extremely impressed by the
quality of the performance Marilyn turned in. Hardcore fans seem to
generally feel that her performance in ""the Misfits"" is her finest; the
role had more depth than many she played, and seemed highly personal. I
argue that she does just as fine a job in just as deep a role in ""Don't
Bother To Knock."" It's my belief that MM was _ALWAYS_ versatile and
talented, but that the American public fell so deeply in love with the
breathless (&amp; brainless) beauty role, that the studios typecast her
until they weren't sure her looks alone would be enough to guarantee
the volume of gross profits which they expected from Marilyn's films.

A hotel guest flirts with a beautiful woman after a breakup from his
girlfriend. He is seduced by the woman while she is babysitting. The child
wakes up and terrorizes the child and the guest. The moral to this movie
is
never judge a book by its cover. Marilyn Monroe give her best acting
performance in the whole movie and makes you understand her character
emotions through the story. Very rare to find a movie with this type of
acting even today.

I had not a seen a movie with the greatest myth of the big screen for a
long time. I had read very little about Roy Baker's ""Don't bother to
knock"", so I was free of prejudices when watching the movie. I felt
like watching Marilyn just acting. Happily, it was a pleasant
experience. I think Marilyn reacted more than acted to a plot that
brought her back to her sad childhood. That is why the viewer can
almost feel her emotions as real ones which is something that makes the
weird and a bit slow story be much more credible. From the rest of the
cast, Richard Widmark shines in spite of having to portray a rather
lame, superficial character with few redeeming features. Above all, I
will remember this film for portraying a different M.Monroe from the
typical dumb-blonde-girl-with-strong-sex-appeal that too often the big
studios wanted her to be.

Marilyn Monroe and Richard Widmark star in this early Monroe star
vehicle. This is one film you'd never see being made today, due to the
new child-care sensibilities. Jim Backus and Lorene Tuttle leave their
child with a complete stranger while they go out for an evening. The
stranger is Monroe, complete with wrist scars, who is the niece of the
elevator man in the hotel where the couple is staying. Mid-evening, she
picks up with Widmark, who is more upset about his lounge singer
girlfriend (Anne Bancroft) breaking up with him than he thought he
would be - he and Monroe flirt from their respective rooms. Widmark
goes to the room, expecting a night of fun. Instead he and the hapless
child get a night of terror, with Monroe believing Widmark is her dead
pilot boyfriend and nearly killing not only the little girl but her
uncle as well. Turns out, Marilyn's been institutionalized and her
uncle (Elisha Cooke, Jr.) thought she was ""nearly well."" Monroe is very
good in this - very beautiful, of course, as well as vulnerable and
believable. The wild look in her eyes when she scolds the little girl
is downright scary. One thing that has always bothered me about Monroe
doing drama is her very excellent diction which always sounds studied
and unnatural. It's a distraction in this film as well. However, she's
so watchable in everything - the camera just adored her - I have to
believe that as she lived and aged, she would have had more chances at
drama.<br><br>Widmark is excellent as the apparent cynic who proves to have more to
him than his girlfriend thought - in fact, his character was much
better with the child than Monroe's; Bancroft's role is small and
belies her future dramatic appearances; and there is a cameo by
""Honeybee Gillis,"" Joan Blondell's sister Gloria, as a photographer.

Don't Bother To Knock finds airline pilot Richard Widmark flying with
more than the safety of his passengers on his mind to New York. He's on
a mission to confront Anne Bancroft who's given him a 'let's call it a
day' letter. Anne works as a singer in a posh New York nightclub
attached to one of the fancier hotels. After a nasty scene with
Bancroft, Widmark's left with an itch to scratch.<br><br>The answer might be Marilyn Monroe across the courtyard looking real
provocative and arousing Widmark's interest. He gives her a call and
things might be going good. Then the little girl, Donna Corcoran, wakes
up from the next room and Marilyn starts to act very weird indeed.<br><br>This one was one of Marilyn's first roles which exploited a little more
than her beauty. She plays a troubled young lady who's just spent some
time in a mental institution. Her uncle Elisha Cook, Jr., got her that
job as a babysitter for Corcoran whose parents Jim Backus and Jeanne
Cagney are at a banquet in the hotel. Truth be told the role was no
stretch for Marilyn given her own sad history.<br><br>Widmark's not a particularly noble character here, but he's a decent
enough man. He's just like millions of other men who when they lose
their love, cure it with trying to love what's available. Anne Bancroft
makes a nice screen debut here although I can't believe she sung those
songs herself. If so, why didn't she do any more singing on screen?<br><br>Though the film gets melodramatic and the characters don't give you any
real rooting interest, Don't Bother To Knock remains a landmark film
for the careers of both Marilyn Monroe and Anne Bancroft.

up from the next room and Marilyn starts to act very weird indeed.<br><br>This one was one of Marilyn's first roles which exploited a little more
than her beauty. She plays a troubled young lady who's just spent some
time in a mental institution. Her uncle Elisha Cook, Jr., got her that
job as a babysitter for Corcoran whose parents Jim Backus and Jeanne
Cagney are at a banquet in the hotel. Truth be told the role was no
stretch for Marilyn given her own sad history.<br><br>Widmark's not a particularly noble character here, but he's a decent
enough man. He's just like millions of other men who when they lose
their love, cure it with trying to love what's available. Anne Bancroft
makes a nice screen debut here although I can't believe she sung those
songs herself. If so, why didn't she do any more singing on screen?<br><br>Though the film gets melodramatic and the characters don't give you any
real rooting interest, Don't Bother To Knock remains a landmark film
for the careers of both Marilyn Monroe and Anne Bancroft.

His father was a meat dealer and butcher. The athletically gifted Caan played football at Michigan State University while studying economics, holds a black belt in karate and for several years was even a regular on the rodeo circuit, where he was nicknamed ""The Jewish Cowboy"". However, while studying at Hofstra University, he became intrigued by acting and was interviewed and accepted at Sanford Meisner\'s Neighborhood Playhouse. He then won a scholarship to study under acting coach Wynn Handman and began to appear in several off-Broadway productions, including ""I Roam"" and ""Mandingo"".He made his screen debut as a sailor in Irma la Douce (1963) and began to impress audiences with his work in Red Line 7000 (1965) and the western El Dorado (1967) alongside John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. Further work followed in Journey to Shiloh (1968) and in the sensitive The Rain People (1969). However, audiences were moved to tears as he put in a heart-rending performance as cancer-stricken Chicago Bears running back Brian Piccolo in the highly rated made-for-TV film Brian\'s Song (1971).With these strong performances under his belt, Francis Ford Coppola then cast him as hot-tempered gangster Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone in the Mafia epic The Godfather (1972). The film was an enormous success, Caan scored a Best Supporting Actor nomination and, in the years since, the role has proven to be the one most fondly remembered by his legion of fans. He reprised the role for several flashback scenes in the sequel The Godfather: Part II (1974) and then moved on to several very diverse projects. These included a cop-buddy crime partnership with Alan Arkin in the uneven Freebie and the Bean (1974), a superb performance as a man playing for his life in The Gambler (1974) alongside Lauren Hutton, and pairing with Barbra Streisand in Funny Lady (1975). Two further strong lead roles came up for him in 1975, first as futuristic sports star ""Jonathon E"" questioning the moral fiber of a sterile society in Rollerball (1975) and teaming up with Robert Duvall in the Sam Peckinpah spy thriller The Killer Elite (1975).Unfortunately, Caan\'s rising star sputtered badly at this stage of his career, and several film projects failed to find fire with either critics or audiences. These included such failures as the hokey Harry and Walter Go to New York (1976), the quasi-western Comes a Horseman (1978) and the saccharine Chapter Two (1979). However, he did score again with the stylish Michael Mann-directed heist movie Thief (1981). He followed this with a supernatural romantic comedy titled Kiss Me Goodbye (1982) and then, due to personal conflicts, dropped out of the spotlight for several years before returning with a stellar performance under old friend Francis Ford Coppola in the moving Gardens of Stone (1987).Caan appeared back in favor with fans and critics alike and raised his visibility with the sci-fi hit Alien Nation (1988) and Dick Tracy (1990), then surprised everyone by playing a meek romance novelist held captive after a car accident by a deranged fan in the dynamic Misery (1990). The 1990s were kind to him and he notched up roles as a band leader in For the Boys (1991), another gangster in Honeymoon in Vegas (1992), appeared in the indie hit Bottle Rocket (1996) and pursued Arnold Schwarzenegger in Eraser (1996).The demand on Caan\'s talents seems to have increased steadily over the past few years as he is making himself known to a new generation of fans. Recent hot onscreen roles have included The Yards (2000), City of Ghosts (2002) and Dogville (2003). In addition, he finds himself at the helm of the hit TV series Las Vegas (2003) as casino security chief ""Big Ed"" Deline. An actor of undeniably manly appeal, James Caan continues to surprise and delight audiences with his invigorating performances.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       firehouse44          Spouse (4) Linda Stokes (7 October\xa01995            - present)\xa0(filed for divorce)\xa0(2 children)                         Ingrid Hajek          (9 September\xa01990            - 29 March\xa01995)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)           Sheila Ryan (12 January\xa01976            - 7 December\xa01976)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)           Dee Jay Mattis (8 July\xa01961            - 1966)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)          Trivia (45)      Played football for Michigan State University.

In the 1990s, he kicked a cocaine habit of some 20 years.      States that Thief (1981) is one of his favorite films.      Son of Arthur & Sophie Caan. His father was a kosher butcher.      Turned down plum roles in MASH (1970) & Apocalypse Now (1979).      Briefly lived at the Playboy Mansion in the 1970s.      One brother, Ronnie Caan, and one sister, Barbara (deceased c. 1981--leukemia).      Some sources give his birth year as 1939.      Was originally tested for the role of Sonny Corleone in The Godfather (1972) (director Francis Ford Coppola had worked with him and Robert Duvall in The Rain People (1969) and wanted them in the movie), but then was slated to play Michael Corleone after Paramount\'s initial choices (which included Warren Beatty, Robert Redford and Ryan O\'Neal) did not pan out. When Al Pacino came on board, Caan was switched back to Sonny.      Spent 9 years on the pro rodeo circuit.      Is a 6th Dan in Karate.      Was a drama major at Hofstra University on Long Island, New York.      Sons with Linda Stokes: James Arthur Caan (b. 6 November 1995) and Jacob Nicholas Caan (b. September 24th 1998).      After being turned down by Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino, Julia Phillips inquired of Caan\'s agent if he would be interested in taking the lead role of Roy Neary in Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Caan\'s agent responded that he would read the script for a guarantee of $1 million plus 10% of the gross if he accepted the role. Phillips went with the original choice, Richard Dreyfuss.      Was considered by George Lucas for the role of Han Solo in Star Wars (1977).      Two generations of his family and the Coppola family have worked together. He worked with Francis Ford Coppola most memorably in the first two Godfather films (The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather: Part II (1974)) and in Gardens of Stone (1987). His son, Scott Caan, appeared in Sonny (2002), which was directed by Nicolas Cage and featured Cage and his brother, Marc Coppola. Sonny was also the name of Caan\'s ""Godfather"" character.      Appears in Misery (1990), which was directed by Rob Reiner. His son, Scott Caan, appeared in Ocean\'s Eleven (2001) and Ocean\'s Twelve (2004), opposite Reiner\'s father, Carl Reiner.      In the Godfather trilogy, Andy Garcia plays the son of Caan\'s character, Sonny Corleone. In Ocean\'s Eleven (2001) and Ocean\'s Twelve (2004), Caan\'s son, Scott Caan, works with Garcia.      Grew up in Sunnyside, Queens, New York City.      In his youth, his nicknames were ""Shoulders"" and ""Killer Caan"".      While on sabbatical from acting he coached a Little League baseball team, there was one incident where his team\'s weakest player hit a home run that won a game. This incident is claimed by Caan as one of the greatest moments of his life.      His film contracts during his rodeo days had written in them that he could not compete in rodeos during filming. This was for fear he would injure or kill himself.      According to the British documentary The Godfather and the Mob (2006), Caan was regularly seen with Gambino family underboss Carmine Persico (aka ""Junior"") during the filming of The Godfather (1972). As Persico was under surveillance by the FBI at the time, Caan came under almost equal scrutiny.      Has a son named Alexander James Caan (b. April 10th 1991) with Ingrid Hajek.      Studied in Rhodes High School in New York.      Studied in The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theater in New York.      Studied Economics in Michigan State University.

During the making of Mickey Blue Eyes (1999), he nicknamed Hugh Grant ""Whippy"" after the Whippet, an English breed of dog that shivers a lot.      Lives in Beverly Hills, California.      His parents, Sophie (Falkenstein) and Arthur Caan, were both German Jews.      Has a daughter, Tara A. Caan (born November 5, 1964), with first wife Dee Jay Mattis.      Avid golfer.      Frequent guest/player at celebrity golf events.      Republican.      Turned down Jack Nicholson\'s role in One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest (1975). Not one to repeat that mistake, he accepted the lead role in Misery (1990) when Nicholson turned it down. Both films involved the lead character being at the mercy of a sadistic nurse.      He appeared in two Best Picture Academy Award winners: The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather: Part II (1974).      Although he played John Cazale\'s elder brother in The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather: Part II (1974), he is five years his junior in real life.      He was considered for the role of Tom Hagen in The Godfather (1972) before Robert Duvall was cast. He eventually played Sonny Corleone in both that film and The Godfather: Part II (1974).      Although he played Morgana King\'s son in The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather: Part II (1974), he is only ten years her junior in real life.      Two of his memorable scenes from The Godfather (1972) have been parodied on The Simpsons. The scene where Sonny beats up Carlo in the street was turned into a scene where Marge does the same to a man who mugged her. Sonny\'s death scene has actually been parodied twice. The first time involved Bart being ambushed with snowballs at school. The second actually involved Caan himself making a guest appearance, and being ambushed at a tollbooth again.      He has appeared in four films directed by Francis Ford Coppola: The Rain People (1969), The Godfather (1972), The Godfather: Part II (1974) and Gardens of Stone (1987).Personal Quotes (27)      [on being voted ""Italian of the Year"" in New York twice, after his role as Sonny Corleone in The Godfather (1972)]: I\'m a Jew from the Bronx. I feel guilty about accepting these awards, but they wouldn\'t let me turn them down.      I have an agent I trust professionally more than anybody else, but with the best intentions he could put me in the shithouse just as fast as somebody who wanted to ruin me.      I\'d rather get sloshed than stoned.      Anyone of my generation who tells you he hasn\'t ""done"" Brando [Marlon Brando] is lying.      My acting technique is to look up at God just before the camera rolls and say, \'Give me a break.\'      I never did anything else. In college I switched majors every two weeks and acting was the only thing that held my interest. The reason I started was to stay away from the meat market. That\'s where I was headed -- to be with the guys who lug beef all day long.      Quite often I\'m misunderstood when I say, \'It\'s not my life, it\'s my job.\' People think that means I don\'t give a shit. Sure, I want to be the best actor in the world. But my life is my family, my son, my friends. I don\'t know how anyone can find fault with that. For some reason when you say, \'It\'s my job\' it sounds like \'Who gives a shit?\' Well, that\'s not it at all. What I do quite honestly and seriously and not in any way being humble is not as important as what the garbage collector does. People make actors important. I go to the movies, I stand on line minding my own business and the manager goes, \'Mr. Caan, Mr. Caan.\' And I say, \'No, no, no, I\'m OK. I\'ll stand on the line.\' \'Oh, you can\'t.\' So, finally they take you through the line and the other 40 people go, \'Hey, Mr. Bigshot.\' And I was just minding my own business, I just wanted to stand there. But other people make it very important that I\'m an actor.      I loved Funny Lady (1975) for whatever reason. People say they didn\'t know I could sing and dance. Well, nobody ever asks me - it\'s always ""Punch this guy"".      [on recent big-budget Hollywood films] [They] absolutely stink. All those pictures, those big extravaganzas - you can\'t remember any characters. Either they had an animal head on them or walked funny . . . If they want me to work, I\'ll go, ""Sure"". Basically, I\'m a whore.      [on Zabriskie Point (1970)] It was the worst fucking - and I have to curse because there is no other way that I can express myself - picture that I ever saw. I got so angry about it. I was in love with a girl. We went to the movie and it ended the whole affair. He [Michelangelo Antonioni] hired cardboard, the worst actors, and it was a conscious effort - that\'s what pissed me off.      [on actors taking themselves too seriously] The truth is . . . myself, De Niro [Robert De Niro], Pacino [Al Pacino], Hoffman [Dustin Hoffman], we were arrogant, pompous asses.      If it was up to them, I\'d be playing Sonny Corleone my entire life. Usually, if there weren\'t eight people dead by page 11, they wouldn\'t send me the script. People say, ""Gee, you do a lot of mafia movies"". I think I\'ve done two, out of 60.      [about living at the Playboy mansion] Actually, it was for medicinal purposes - I was just getting divorced. This doctor wrote me a prescription to live there because he thought it would help me get over the pain of my divorce. My God, it worked. I got over it pretty quickly.      I\'ll see a beautiful girl walking up to me and I\'ll think, ""Oh, my God, I can\'t believe my good luck"". But then she\'ll say, ""Where\'s your son?"" or ""My mother loves you.""      I had great, great times as a Little League coach. People were talking about me quitting acting, and they would say, ""What about your creative juices?"" Coaching is creative, because you could take a kid who thought he wasn\'t any good and, within four minutes, change his mind. And I didn\'t have to wait six months for them to put music to it. How good a Little League coach was I? I was a little hyper. One thing I learned was that talent comes from everywhere; it doesn\'t have to come just from the ghetto. But in Beverly Hills, because Daddy has a grocery store, the kids lack a lot of try.      There\'s a big difference between wanting to work and having to work. And I had to learn that the hard way. Now money is very important to me, because I ain\'t got it.      [on being confused with his character from The Godfather (1972)] I\'ll bump into a guy in a bar, and he\'ll say, ""I\'m sorry, Sonny!"" It\'s surreal.      A ""Godfather Four""? Not by Francis [Francis Ford Coppola], anyway. Who cares? There shouldn\'t have been a The Godfather: Part III (1990).      You know those actors who say, ""I want to be alone"" or they\'re walking around with their friggin\' bodyguards? A bodyguard! I\'d never have a bodyguard. I mean, who wants to hurt me? But the point is that they have the bodyguard so that they can say, ""Leave me alone!"" It\'s this revolving door thing. If somebody didn\'t recognize them, they\'d have a heart attack, the bastards.      [on fans confusing him with his characters] Look, you only pray when you start in this business that you get to the point where people recognize you or quote you. I mean, I\'ve got a lot of people who are like, ""Hey, your ankle OK?"" from Misery (1990). I get that a lot. It\'s harmless. Or they\'ll say, ""Hey, don\'t go through that toll booth again"" or ""Have the right change"". That\'s great! First of all, it means that they remember the picture. There\'s nothing not to like about it . . . No, I hope they never stop.      I did this picture last year with Nicole Kidman and Lars von Trier, Dogville (2003), and it\'s supposed to be a trilogy, but now that she\'s walked away from it, I\'m walking from it. He is very anti-American, so screw him. I\'m very pro-America. I\'m a conservative, basically.      I went through some bad times, some very self-destructive stuff, you know, when I was on top. I\'d got involved in partying and doing all that and I lost my sister and, basically, I got all screwed up in my head. She was like my best friend and I lost her to leukemia and I was just a mess. I had a lot of money because I\'d worked a lot and saved it. I had it in a pension plan and then I lost all my money. My accountant. I just woke up one morning and I didn\'t have a dime. We\'re talking about tons . . . I mean, a lot of money, and I was flat broke.      [His advice to younger actors] The main pearl of wisdom I give these young kids is that you shouldn\'t make your career your whole life. No matter what heights you achieve, even if you\'re Brad Pitt, the slide is coming, sure as death and taxes. So if you put everything into that one basket - acting - you\'ll wind up hurting yourself, either with drugs or any other self-destructive thing you can think of.      [on figuring out how to play Sonny Corleone] I didn\'t have to work on an accent or anything, but I couldn\'t quite get a grasp. I was shaving to go to dinner or something, and for some reason I started thinking of Don Rickles. Because I knew Rickles. Somebody was watching over me and gave me this thing: being Rickles, kind of say-anything, do-anything.      I won\'t mention names, but in my career, the most talented people invariably are the easiest and nicest to get along with. The ones that are difficult try to camouflage the fact that they haven\'t got shit to offer. So they complain about frilly things that really don\'t mean a shit, like their dressing rooms, makeup.      (On turning down One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest (1975)) Four or five different directors came to me with that at different times. I go, \'It\'s not a movie. Who wants to look at four institution walls?\' Milos Forman made it great. Jack was great in it. I made a flat-out, fucking mistake.      (On turning down Kramer vs. Kramer (1979)) I was first, Dustin [Hoffman] was last on the list of five guys they wanted. The director [Robert Benton] kept it up with me for three months. I said, \'This is middle-class, bourgeois horseshit.\' I mean, \'Cut to kid crying.\' Oh, please.

However, he had been effectively blacklisted -- unofficially banned from appearing in Hollywood films -- since 1950, two years before Kazan sang before HUAC, when Carnovsky himself refused to ""name names"" before the Committee. Carnovsky did not make any more movies for the better part of a decade -- in fact, his movie acting career essentially was over -- but he did have a thriving career on the Broadway stage, the venue where he established his reputation as a thespian back in the 1930s.Morris Carnovsky was born in St. Louis, Missouri on September 5, 1898, the son of a grocer. Upon graduation from high school he attended St. Louis\' Washington University.Like most actors of his generation, he worked his way up the ladder by first appearing with traveling stock companies. Eventually, he landed in New York City, where he became a member of the Theatre Guild, the legendary theatrical company appearing as Kublai Khan in Nobel Prize winner \'Eugene O\'Neill\'s play ""Marco Millions\' (I)\'. Subsequently, he became one of the founding members of the left-wing Group Theatre.Founded in 1931 by Lee Strasberg and Harold Clurman, and Cheryl Crawford, The Group Theatre contained Luther Adler, Stella Adler, Elia Kazan, and playwright Clifford Odets; the latter three were major forces in transforming American theater and acting, a process that began with the Provincetown Theatre. Stella Adler, Elia Kazan and Lee Strasberg, including their students/latter Group Theatre members like Bobby Lewis, were instrumental in making ""The Method"" -- a variation of Konstantin Stanislavski\'s acting theories, based on finding and cultivating ""motivation"" -- revolutionized American acting on stage and in the movies, most famously through Adler\'s student Marlon Brando. Kazan and Strasberg later founded the Actors Studio, America\'s premier acting school that promulgated ""The Method"" via such alumni as James Dean, Paul Newman and hundreds of others.Carnovsky was a member of the Group Theater until it broke up in 1940. He appeared prominently in Odets\' plays ""Awake and Sing"" and Golden Boy (1939). Carnovsky\'s talents were in demand by other theatrical troupes, and he appeared on Broadway in the 1930s in multiple non-Group Theatre productions.Eventually, Hollywood beckoned and Carnovsky made his screen debut in The Life of Emile Zola (1937), playing Anatole France in support of Paul Muni. Settling in Los Angeles after the Group Theatre breakup, Carnovsky was one of the founders of the Actor\'s Laboratory and became involved with the the Hollywood Communist Party, whose cultural apparatchik, screenwriter John Howard Lawson, was later one of the Hollywood Ten, the first group of leftists blacklisted by the film industry. While Carnovsky was never involved in espionage or any overt acts against the interests of the United States (as were none of the Hollywood Ten or other blacklistees), he led Marxist study groups in his home, as Sterling Hayden testified to before HUAC.In his 1952 testimony before HUAC, Elia Kazan named Carnovsky as a member of the Communist Party cell he had belonged to in the Group Theatre. Other members included Lee Strasberg\'s wife, Paula (best known as Marilyn Monroe\'s acting coach). Kazan had quit the cell in the mid-1930s, he said, when it was ordered by the Party to undermine Harold Clurman and Lee Strasberg (who did not know his wife was a communist) and take over the Group Theatre. The attempted coup was never launched.In 1950, Carnovsky was hailed before HUAC, where he refused to ""name names."" This resulted in his blacklisting, not Kazan\'s testimony. (Kazan said that Carnovsky, like others he named, already were known by the Committee.) The blacklist did not exist on Broadway, and producer (and future Osar-winning actor) John Houseman cast Carnovsky in the Broadway production of Henrik Ibsen\'s ""An Enemy of the People,"" whose script was written by future HUAC target Arthur Miller. He acted in many Broadway productions throughout the 1950s and into the \'60s.A part in Sidney Lumet\'s film version of Arthur Miller\'s A View from the Bridge (1962) did not revive his movie career, and he continued to act on stage. He died on September 1, 1992, at the age of 94.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Jon C.

The greatest movie ever made about gambling and risk taking.<br><br>Axel Freed (Caan) is addicted to risk, but more than that he must take
risks
to justify his existence.<br><br>The movie begins with Axel being told by his bookie (Sorvino) that he must
repay the $45,000 he owes on gambling debts and follows Axel through a
journey of self abasement, self hatred and rage as he recoups, then loses
the money.<br><br>A series of telling vignettes occur during which Axel reveals an
unrealistic
belief that he can will himself to win and be successful.  Never more so
than when during a game of blackjack he doubles his bet when holding 18,
saying to the dealer 'Give me the three'<br><br>The height of his self delusion is revealed when Sorvino tells his debtor
that he will reveal a secret he has never told an obsessive gambler like
Axel before - he wants to lose.  Axel tells him scornfully that he knows
this, but really he wants to cherish the illusion that he can control his
destiny.<br><br>When I recommend this movie as one of the greats to people I am invariably
told afterwards by those I have so advised that they do not understand the
ending.<br><br>Axel goes into a ghetto neighbourhood and allows himself to be cornered by
a
knife wielding pimp (Antonio Fargas) whom he tries to provoke into killing
him.  Once again he is taking risk to the limit - he has just committed an
act that has further damaged is battered self esteem and his way out is to
take a serious risk - this time with his life as the stake - because he is
never more alive than when he has 'proven' his false theory that he is the
captain of his fate.<br><br>(Those in doubt of my thesis check out the event early in the film where
Axel plays basketball one on one with some Black neighbourhood youths and
is
willing to bet $20 to a dime when his level bet stake of $20 cannot be
matched; then remember that just before he went for his 'death bet' he
tried
to get the non betting Sorvino to bet him $2,000 against making a very
difficult basketball shot first time)<br><br>The Gambler is a brilliantly acted,written and directed film perhaps too
dark and intellectual in its approach for most people.<br><br>Intellectuality is shown in this film as a value of limited use if
unsupported by character, as Axel's life philosophy sees an intelligent
and
sophisticated man allowing himself to be made the prey of some of the most
scathingly played low life thugs in cinematic history.  Axel's literary
induced and supported love of desire and belief in the effectivity of the
will of the individual is the delusion destroying him.  The street smart
savvy of his uneducated grandfather (Carnovsky) and the bookies and
hustlers
who prey upon him wins out every time over Axel's academic
delusionalism.<br><br>'The Gambler' is a real winner in the movie stakes - one of my all time
greats and well deserving of a rating of 10 out of 10 in my
book

The theme of addiction is a favourite area for film makers and ""The
Gambler""
stands as the best and most intelligent film about the addiction of
gambling. The fact that it is a little known or seen film is perhaps to do
with its intellectual script which, with references to Dostoyevsky, may be
too pretentious for some. However, rather than being a cleched film about
a
good man's decent into the hell of addiction this is a film about a
selfish,
egotistical man, from a good background, who happily wades deeper and
deeper
into his obsession.<br><br>The film's title pretty much sums up the story, with the character of Axel
Freed, played by James Caan, beginning the film as a compulsive gambler
but
sinking further and further into his habit as the film goes on. He does
this
despite his undoubted intelligence - he is a college lecturer - and
despite
the pleading of his mother, rich grandfather and friends.<br><br>Freed is by no means a likeable character. Like most addicts all he cares
about is his next fix and will happily ask his mother for tens of
thousands
of dollars to repay an outstanding debt. No one, including his girlfriend,
played by Lauren Hutton, and his college students, remain untouched by his
addiction, a decision which comes back to haunt him in the film's
climax.<br><br>Many people have been left puzzled by the film's ending which is cryptic
and
unresolved. However this merely stands as a metaphor for addiction
generally, that it can never be fully cured or ever totally go away. Axel
is, however, obviously disgusted with himself and the effect his gambling
has had on those around him and his late night journey into the all-black
neighbourhood is his way of seeking retribution for his
sins.<br><br>""The Gambler"" provides James Caan with, alongside Michael Mann's ""Thief"",
the best role of his career. The character of Axel Freed provides him with
a
range of emotions, especially in the way he treats those he cares about,
as
his gambling slowly takes precedence over everything else. Anyone who
thinks
James Caan's career began and ended with ""The Godfather"" should definitely
see ""The Gambler"", as this proves he is one of the top actors of his
generation and that he can play more than just the tough guy roles he is
too
often saddled with.<br><br>The film is brilliantly directed by Karel Reisz as not a single scene
rings
false despite a 111 minute running time. After directing the classic
""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"" in Britain, Reisz relocated to
America,
but, unfortunately, ""The Gambler"" represents the only time he reached
those
heights again.<br><br>

From the first scene to the last I was on the edge of my seat. Bet
after bet my stomach turned. Caan's Axel Freed is driven to hit the big
one, but it never seems to come or be enough. He loves the thrill of
losing and feels safe when he is at the bottom.<br><br>Watching Freed bet tens of thousands of dollars on whims is
excruciating. This film is one huge car wreck that you can't turn away
from. With each scene the damage gets worse and worse.<br><br>""If all my bets were safe they just wouldn't have any juice,"" he tells
his bookie.<br><br>Axel is never happy--even when he is doing the thing he enjoys most.
You can see the underlying dissatisfaction he has with his job, his
life, and the universe in general. The only constant in his existence
is the bet. Win or lose.<br><br>Freed is very adept at evading the lowlifes he owes his shirt to. It is
a joyride for him to constantly ""dodge the bullet"". That is why each
bet becomes riskier and riskier. He wants to see what will happen to
him when all of his luck runs out.<br><br>At one point in the film Axel reads a passage from an essay on George
Washington to his class. He and his students conclude that Washington
was afraid of failure and that he tried to remove the element of risk
from everything he did. It is the very antithesis of Axel's life as a
gambler. He creates situations that are totally immersed in risk
believing that it is the only way to ensure true success. All or
nothing. He is willing to compromise not only himself, but anyone
around him who cares about him. By displaying his dark,
self-destructive side he gambles with their feelings and challenges
them to either love him or leave him.<br><br>It was a special treat to see two actors (Cann and Sorvino) who are in
two of the best crime movies ever made (The Godfather and Goodfellas)
together in the same film.<br><br>Also Antonio Vargas is appropriately slimy as the Pimp (sort of an
R-rated Huggy Bear).<br><br>There are some pivotal moments in the film like when Axel is told that
he must get one of his basketball-playing students to fix a game; or
when he confronts his millionaire grandfather after learning that he
refused to cover his debt.<br><br>I won't give away the ending, but the payoff is not what you would
expect in American cinema.

I found this film very, very good and being a gambler myself could relate
to
the central character. James Caan is brilliant as always. The film keeps
simmering on until a quite dramatic ending where Axel goes to seek thrills
that even gambling cannot provide him with.<br><br>A fine, realist film for all, but gamblers, quite bad gamblers at that,
will
find to be particularly interesting.

Just about everyone who has posted a reply about the shocking ending
was simply left too much in the dark to realize that it tied together a
different root demise of Axel Freed than gambling.<br><br>Just as a compulsive behavior leads to compulsive gambling, the root
evil of Axel Freed was that he had a masochist behavior. When you look
a little closer at all the scenes where he acts out this kind of
behavior, it makes more sense. The problem lies in that the casual
observer is only looking at the problem gambling aspect. There is more
to this guy than just that.<br><br>The ways he handles his relationships with his mother, girlfriend,
grandfather and feelings at the end towards the basketball player ALL
indicate there is masochist behavior involved. These are more than just
selfish acts. There is some actual self hatred going on as well.
Without giving away the final scene, this scene further accentuates the
point by sending himself into that situation. The final scene was a
conscious act, not something resulting from random chance or risk.<br><br>So despite the movie having some gambling theme to it, this really
wasn't necessarily about gambling addiction. It was about the nature of
Axel Freed. If the movie had no gambling scenes in it at all this point
would be more readily identifiable.<br><br>The only real oddity in the final scene is the placement of the final
scene. If this scene was placed somewhere in the middle of the movie,
the underlying theme of his masochist pattern of behavior would have
been more easily identified with. Because the movie started with a
gambling scene, we all assumed it was just about gambling. Wrong!<br><br>Its a tricky concept to catch the first time. Watch this movie again
with this concept in mind and the movie will make more sense.

I saw this movie back in 1974/75 when it was released. I was already a
Caan man. My comments are just random tidbits. Burt Young would go on
to join Caan in 1975's The Killer Elite"". Monkey (London Lee) was a
stand-up comic who appeared numerous times on the Ed Sullivan show in
the 60's. Lauren Hutton would trade Caan for Burt Reynolds in Gator.
Caan earlier had beat out Burt for the role of Sonny Corleone. The line
I remember most from this film is when Axel's mother is trying to get a
bank loan to fund his gambling debt. There are some bureaucratic snafus
and the bank officer isn't sure he has the proof to approve the loan to
mom. Caan says ""I came out of her womb and I know she's my mom. Now
give her the god... money!"".

""The Gambler"" (1974) is a riveting drama about a man who - like many
young adults in the baby boom generation - rejects the world of
privilege and comfort he has been born into. Rather than turning to
some form of counter-culture politics, however, Alex Freed (James Caan)
holds an establishment job as a professor of English while pursuing
""the juice"" of financial, social, and even physical risk and pain
during his considerable free time.<br><br>Like Dostoyevski's Underground Man, to whom the screenplay pays homage
in an early scene of Freed lecturing to his students at NYC (i. e.
CCNY), ""the gambler"" rejects the middle class world of reason and
social convention and instead embraces the irrational, the realm of
will and desire where two plus two can equal five and where poets,
athletes, and addicts can ""know"" and experience things that ordinary
human beings living in the rut of mundane existence cannot.<br><br>Unfortunately for Freed he will never be a poet although, as a
literature professor, he can quote Shakespeare, e.e. cummings, and Walt
Whitman with anyone. He can also turn an original phrase or two and
lead his relatives, friends, and other less literary folk to believe
that he has great books in him. But the truth is that he's a third rate
talent stuck in a $1500 a month gig trying to wheedle literary
appreciation out of reluctant undergrads who are obviously going
through the motions to get paper qualified for one pragmatic goal or
another.<br><br>He is also not a great athlete although he kids himself about how he
might have been a star basketball player - even, at one point, stopping
at a playground in Harlem to take on a local 15 year old hot shot in a
game of one-on-one, betting $20 to a dime that he will win. He gives
the hot shot a pretty good game, but loses, thus establishing the real
extent of his athletic talent for us - and perhaps himself - to see.
No, the only sure and easy way he can get the juice is through gambling
and the self deceptions about winning and losing that his compulsive
behavior entails.<br><br>Considering the barrage of searing insults that Harvard-educated Axel
Freed hurls at the Brown University (my alma mater) football team, I
would like to say very bad things about this film, but I'd be lying.
Written by heralded screenwriter James Toback (""Fingers,"" ""Bugsy,""
etc.) and featuring one of James Caan's finest performances, ""The
Gambler"" has deservedly become a 1970s cult classic.

Sometimes he wins; but mostly he loses. Gambling is an addiction for
Axel Freed (James Caan), a professor of English literature and lover of
classical music. The film is set in New York City.<br><br>The object of the obsession can be almost anything on which a bet is
placed: dice, cards, a basketball game, a college football match. It
really doesn't matter. Axel just can't keep from making bets. He's like
two different people. In a classroom setting, he is logical and
intelligent. But when betting, he throws away the logic in favor of
risk taking. In these situations he seems to lack the normal
psychological ""brakes"" that could be applied to his destructive
over-betting. In his own words: ""I like the threat of losing"". And
always in the background are the thugs and the con men that lord over
Axel, when he borrows to gamble, but can't pay his debt.<br><br>Some of Axel's classroom lectures have real thematic value. The ideas
relate both to him, and incidentally to some modern-day politicians.
For example, a person ""... claims an idea is true because he wants it
to be true, because he says it's true. And the issue isn't whether he's
right, but whether he has the will to believe he's right, no matter how
many proofs there are that say he's wrong"". Axel continues: ""D.H.
Lawrence says Americans fear new experience more than they fear
anything. They are the world's greatest dodgers, because they dodge
their own very selves"". Heavy stuff.<br><br>Despite a disappointing ending, ""The Gambler"" is an interesting
character study of a personality type that is all too prevalent in
modern society. The film's color cinematography is generally dark, in
keeping with the film's theme. Overall acting is fine. Paul Sorvino
gives an especially convincing performance, as does James Caan. The
plot proceeds rather slowly.<br><br>Mostly, the film has terrific thematic value. It encourages the viewer
to pause and reflect, to ponder, to question one's own motivations.
That is a trait lacking in many current movies.

**SPOILERS** Terribly depressing character study of a degenerate
gambler who's luck hit rock bottom with him getting into the hole for
$44,000.00 to the mob who's been bankrolling his action.<br><br>James Caan in one of his most memorable roles as Axel Freed a collage
English professor, at the prestigious Fordham University in New York
City, who's gambling his life away in his almost suicidal attempt to
make the big score. Axel is not a total loser in the movie, he does
have his share of big hits in the film, but like almost all gamblers he
plays to lose more then to win by going against his better judgment, it
makes things more challenging and exciting that way for him. It's when
he bets and ends up broke that Alex has to go to local mob Shylock's to
get cash, to continue his insane betting, that has him at the brink of
having his arms legs and head disjointed and broken or busted. <br><br>Because of the subject matter as well as the fine acting from Mr. Caan
and the rest of the cast the movie really grabs you and leaves you
feeling almost as depressed and despondent as Axel is in it. You really
feel for the man since he has an almost incurable disease, compulsive
gambling, thats slowly turning this very likable and friendly person
into an uncontrollable monster. <br><br>Axel is not only destroying himself but his widowed mom Naomie Freed,
Jacqueline Brooks. Naomie cashes out her life savings of almost
$50,000.00 to pay off her sons debts to the mob. As soon as Axel gets
the money his mother gave him to practically save his life and limbs he
immediately gambles it away on a number of basketball games! This puts
him into even more of a hole with the gangsters then he already was in.
At the same time Alexs actions has his shocked girlfriend Billie
,Lauren Hutton, walk out on him in total disgust. <br><br>Walking aimlessly in the park Axel is grabbed by two mobsters and taken
to a mob hideout in the city. Given one last chance to pay up or else
they come up with what even Axel feels is something thats not worth his
life to do. He's told to get one of his students Spencer, Carl W.
Crudup, who's a top basketball player for the collage team to shave
points in a big game that he's playing in that evening with Axel giving
him $5,000.00 to do it. This act of corrupting an innocent person to
save his hide for the troubles that he got himself into was the straw
that broke the camels back for the now extremely tormented Axel and
finally opened his eyes, to not only what he was doing to himself but
to those around him as well. <br><br>With his debts now finally paid off and the mob off his back Axel
instead of being relived becomes suicidal and at the end of the movie

a shocker in the 70s james toback's  take on Dostoevskyan's fate, caan
actually seems to act instead of react and gives a far more compelling
performance than say, Thief 7 yrs. later. The Gambler is James toback's
career making debut and has some of the most intense scenes toback would
ever film despite numerous strong films later on. the ending is monumental.
watch it build and be amazed. 9 of 10.

The greatest movie ever made about gambling and risk taking.<br><br>Axel Freed (Caan) is addicted to risk, but more than that he must take
risks
to justify his existence.<br><br>The movie begins with Axel being told by his bookie (Sorvino) that he must
repay the $45,000 he owes on gambling debts and follows Axel through a
journey of self abasement, self hatred and rage as he recoups, then loses
the money.<br><br>A series of telling vignettes occur during which Axel reveals an
unrealistic
belief that he can will himself to win and be successful.  Never more so
than when during a game of blackjack he doubles his bet when holding 18,
saying to the dealer 'Give me the three'<br><br>The height of his self delusion is revealed when Sorvino tells his debtor
that he will reveal a secret he has never told an obsessive gambler like
Axel before - he wants to lose.  Axel tells him scornfully that he knows
this, but really he wants to cherish the illusion that he can control his
destiny.<br><br>When I recommend this movie as one of the greats to people I am invariably
told afterwards by those I have so advised that they do not understand the
ending.<br><br>Axel goes into a ghetto neighbourhood and allows himself to be cornered by
a
knife wielding pimp (Antonio Fargas) whom he tries to provoke into killing
him.  Once again he is taking risk to the limit - he has just committed an
act that has further damaged is battered self esteem and his way out is to
take a serious risk - this time with his life as the stake - because he is
never more alive than when he has 'proven' his false theory that he is the
captain of his fate.<br><br>(Those in doubt of my thesis check out the event early in the film where
Axel plays basketball one on one with some Black neighbourhood youths and
is
willing to bet $20 to a dime when his level bet stake of $20 cannot be
matched; then remember that just before he went for his 'death bet' he
tried
to get the non betting Sorvino to bet him $2,000 against making a very
difficult basketball shot first time)<br><br>The Gambler is a brilliantly acted,written and directed film perhaps too
dark and intellectual in its approach for most people.<br><br>Intellectuality is shown in this film as a value of limited use if
unsupported by character, as Axel's life philosophy sees an intelligent
and
sophisticated man allowing himself to be made the prey of some of the most
scathingly played low life thugs in cinematic history.  Axel's literary
induced and supported love of desire and belief in the effectivity of the
will of the individual is the delusion destroying him.  The street smart
savvy of his uneducated grandfather (Carnovsky) and the bookies and
hustlers
who prey upon him wins out every time over Axel's academic
delusionalism.<br><br>'The Gambler' is a real winner in the movie stakes - one of my all time
greats and well deserving of a rating of 10 out of 10 in my
book

The theme of addiction is a favourite area for film makers and ""The
Gambler""
stands as the best and most intelligent film about the addiction of
gambling. The fact that it is a little known or seen film is perhaps to do
with its intellectual script which, with references to Dostoyevsky, may be
too pretentious for some. However, rather than being a cleched film about
a
good man's decent into the hell of addiction this is a film about a
selfish,
egotistical man, from a good background, who happily wades deeper and
deeper
into his obsession.<br><br>The film's title pretty much sums up the story, with the character of Axel
Freed, played by James Caan, beginning the film as a compulsive gambler
but
sinking further and further into his habit as the film goes on. He does
this
despite his undoubted intelligence - he is a college lecturer - and
despite
the pleading of his mother, rich grandfather and friends.<br><br>Freed is by no means a likeable character. Like most addicts all he cares
about is his next fix and will happily ask his mother for tens of
thousands
of dollars to repay an outstanding debt. No one, including his girlfriend,
played by Lauren Hutton, and his college students, remain untouched by his
addiction, a decision which comes back to haunt him in the film's
climax.<br><br>Many people have been left puzzled by the film's ending which is cryptic
and
unresolved. However this merely stands as a metaphor for addiction
generally, that it can never be fully cured or ever totally go away. Axel
is, however, obviously disgusted with himself and the effect his gambling
has had on those around him and his late night journey into the all-black
neighbourhood is his way of seeking retribution for his
sins.<br><br>""The Gambler"" provides James Caan with, alongside Michael Mann's ""Thief"",
the best role of his career. The character of Axel Freed provides him with
a
range of emotions, especially in the way he treats those he cares about,
as
his gambling slowly takes precedence over everything else. Anyone who
thinks
James Caan's career began and ended with ""The Godfather"" should definitely
see ""The Gambler"", as this proves he is one of the top actors of his
generation and that he can play more than just the tough guy roles he is
too
often saddled with.<br><br>The film is brilliantly directed by Karel Reisz as not a single scene
rings
false despite a 111 minute running time. After directing the classic
""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"" in Britain, Reisz relocated to
America,
but, unfortunately, ""The Gambler"" represents the only time he reached
those
heights again.<br><br>

From the first scene to the last I was on the edge of my seat. Bet
after bet my stomach turned. Caan's Axel Freed is driven to hit the big
one, but it never seems to come or be enough. He loves the thrill of
losing and feels safe when he is at the bottom.<br><br>Watching Freed bet tens of thousands of dollars on whims is
excruciating. This film is one huge car wreck that you can't turn away
from. With each scene the damage gets worse and worse.<br><br>""If all my bets were safe they just wouldn't have any juice,"" he tells
his bookie.<br><br>Axel is never happy--even when he is doing the thing he enjoys most.
You can see the underlying dissatisfaction he has with his job, his
life, and the universe in general. The only constant in his existence
is the bet. Win or lose.<br><br>Freed is very adept at evading the lowlifes he owes his shirt to. It is
a joyride for him to constantly ""dodge the bullet"". That is why each
bet becomes riskier and riskier. He wants to see what will happen to
him when all of his luck runs out.<br><br>At one point in the film Axel reads a passage from an essay on George
Washington to his class. He and his students conclude that Washington
was afraid of failure and that he tried to remove the element of risk
from everything he did. It is the very antithesis of Axel's life as a
gambler. He creates situations that are totally immersed in risk
believing that it is the only way to ensure true success. All or
nothing. He is willing to compromise not only himself, but anyone
around him who cares about him. By displaying his dark,
self-destructive side he gambles with their feelings and challenges
them to either love him or leave him.<br><br>It was a special treat to see two actors (Cann and Sorvino) who are in
two of the best crime movies ever made (The Godfather and Goodfellas)
together in the same film.<br><br>Also Antonio Vargas is appropriately slimy as the Pimp (sort of an
R-rated Huggy Bear).<br><br>There are some pivotal moments in the film like when Axel is told that
he must get one of his basketball-playing students to fix a game; or
when he confronts his millionaire grandfather after learning that he
refused to cover his debt.<br><br>I won't give away the ending, but the payoff is not what you would
expect in American cinema.

I found this film very, very good and being a gambler myself could relate
to
the central character. James Caan is brilliant as always. The film keeps
simmering on until a quite dramatic ending where Axel goes to seek thrills
that even gambling cannot provide him with.<br><br>A fine, realist film for all, but gamblers, quite bad gamblers at that,
will
find to be particularly interesting.

Just about everyone who has posted a reply about the shocking ending
was simply left too much in the dark to realize that it tied together a
different root demise of Axel Freed than gambling.<br><br>Just as a compulsive behavior leads to compulsive gambling, the root
evil of Axel Freed was that he had a masochist behavior. When you look
a little closer at all the scenes where he acts out this kind of
behavior, it makes more sense. The problem lies in that the casual
observer is only looking at the problem gambling aspect. There is more
to this guy than just that.<br><br>The ways he handles his relationships with his mother, girlfriend,
grandfather and feelings at the end towards the basketball player ALL
indicate there is masochist behavior involved. These are more than just
selfish acts. There is some actual self hatred going on as well.
Without giving away the final scene, this scene further accentuates the
point by sending himself into that situation. The final scene was a
conscious act, not something resulting from random chance or risk.<br><br>So despite the movie having some gambling theme to it, this really
wasn't necessarily about gambling addiction. It was about the nature of
Axel Freed. If the movie had no gambling scenes in it at all this point
would be more readily identifiable.<br><br>The only real oddity in the final scene is the placement of the final
scene. If this scene was placed somewhere in the middle of the movie,
the underlying theme of his masochist pattern of behavior would have
been more easily identified with. Because the movie started with a
gambling scene, we all assumed it was just about gambling. Wrong!<br><br>Its a tricky concept to catch the first time. Watch this movie again
with this concept in mind and the movie will make more sense.

I saw this movie back in 1974/75 when it was released. I was already a
Caan man. My comments are just random tidbits. Burt Young would go on
to join Caan in 1975's The Killer Elite"". Monkey (London Lee) was a
stand-up comic who appeared numerous times on the Ed Sullivan show in
the 60's. Lauren Hutton would trade Caan for Burt Reynolds in Gator.
Caan earlier had beat out Burt for the role of Sonny Corleone. The line
I remember most from this film is when Axel's mother is trying to get a
bank loan to fund his gambling debt. There are some bureaucratic snafus
and the bank officer isn't sure he has the proof to approve the loan to
mom. Caan says ""I came out of her womb and I know she's my mom. Now
give her the god... money!"".

""The Gambler"" (1974) is a riveting drama about a man who - like many
young adults in the baby boom generation - rejects the world of
privilege and comfort he has been born into. Rather than turning to
some form of counter-culture politics, however, Alex Freed (James Caan)
holds an establishment job as a professor of English while pursuing
""the juice"" of financial, social, and even physical risk and pain
during his considerable free time.<br><br>Like Dostoyevski's Underground Man, to whom the screenplay pays homage
in an early scene of Freed lecturing to his students at NYC (i. e.
CCNY), ""the gambler"" rejects the middle class world of reason and
social convention and instead embraces the irrational, the realm of
will and desire where two plus two can equal five and where poets,
athletes, and addicts can ""know"" and experience things that ordinary
human beings living in the rut of mundane existence cannot.<br><br>Unfortunately for Freed he will never be a poet although, as a
literature professor, he can quote Shakespeare, e.e. cummings, and Walt
Whitman with anyone. He can also turn an original phrase or two and
lead his relatives, friends, and other less literary folk to believe
that he has great books in him. But the truth is that he's a third rate
talent stuck in a $1500 a month gig trying to wheedle literary
appreciation out of reluctant undergrads who are obviously going
through the motions to get paper qualified for one pragmatic goal or
another.<br><br>He is also not a great athlete although he kids himself about how he
might have been a star basketball player - even, at one point, stopping
at a playground in Harlem to take on a local 15 year old hot shot in a
game of one-on-one, betting $20 to a dime that he will win. He gives
the hot shot a pretty good game, but loses, thus establishing the real
extent of his athletic talent for us - and perhaps himself - to see.
No, the only sure and easy way he can get the juice is through gambling
and the self deceptions about winning and losing that his compulsive
behavior entails.<br><br>Considering the barrage of searing insults that Harvard-educated Axel
Freed hurls at the Brown University (my alma mater) football team, I
would like to say very bad things about this film, but I'd be lying.
Written by heralded screenwriter James Toback (""Fingers,"" ""Bugsy,""
etc.) and featuring one of James Caan's finest performances, ""The
Gambler"" has deservedly become a 1970s cult classic.

Sometimes he wins; but mostly he loses. Gambling is an addiction for
Axel Freed (James Caan), a professor of English literature and lover of
classical music. The film is set in New York City.<br><br>The object of the obsession can be almost anything on which a bet is
placed: dice, cards, a basketball game, a college football match. It
really doesn't matter. Axel just can't keep from making bets. He's like
two different people. In a classroom setting, he is logical and
intelligent. But when betting, he throws away the logic in favor of
risk taking. In these situations he seems to lack the normal
psychological ""brakes"" that could be applied to his destructive
over-betting. In his own words: ""I like the threat of losing"". And
always in the background are the thugs and the con men that lord over
Axel, when he borrows to gamble, but can't pay his debt.<br><br>Some of Axel's classroom lectures have real thematic value. The ideas
relate both to him, and incidentally to some modern-day politicians.
For example, a person ""... claims an idea is true because he wants it
to be true, because he says it's true. And the issue isn't whether he's
right, but whether he has the will to believe he's right, no matter how
many proofs there are that say he's wrong"". Axel continues: ""D.H.
Lawrence says Americans fear new experience more than they fear
anything. They are the world's greatest dodgers, because they dodge
their own very selves"". Heavy stuff.<br><br>Despite a disappointing ending, ""The Gambler"" is an interesting
character study of a personality type that is all too prevalent in
modern society. The film's color cinematography is generally dark, in
keeping with the film's theme. Overall acting is fine. Paul Sorvino
gives an especially convincing performance, as does James Caan. The
plot proceeds rather slowly.<br><br>Mostly, the film has terrific thematic value. It encourages the viewer
to pause and reflect, to ponder, to question one's own motivations.
That is a trait lacking in many current movies.

**SPOILERS** Terribly depressing character study of a degenerate
gambler who's luck hit rock bottom with him getting into the hole for
$44,000.00 to the mob who's been bankrolling his action.<br><br>James Caan in one of his most memorable roles as Axel Freed a collage
English professor, at the prestigious Fordham University in New York
City, who's gambling his life away in his almost suicidal attempt to
make the big score. Axel is not a total loser in the movie, he does
have his share of big hits in the film, but like almost all gamblers he
plays to lose more then to win by going against his better judgment, it
makes things more challenging and exciting that way for him. It's when
he bets and ends up broke that Alex has to go to local mob Shylock's to
get cash, to continue his insane betting, that has him at the brink of
having his arms legs and head disjointed and broken or busted. <br><br>Because of the subject matter as well as the fine acting from Mr. Caan
and the rest of the cast the movie really grabs you and leaves you
feeling almost as depressed and despondent as Axel is in it. You really
feel for the man since he has an almost incurable disease, compulsive
gambling, thats slowly turning this very likable and friendly person
into an uncontrollable monster. <br><br>Axel is not only destroying himself but his widowed mom Naomie Freed,
Jacqueline Brooks. Naomie cashes out her life savings of almost
$50,000.00 to pay off her sons debts to the mob. As soon as Axel gets
the money his mother gave him to practically save his life and limbs he
immediately gambles it away on a number of basketball games! This puts
him into even more of a hole with the gangsters then he already was in.
At the same time Alexs actions has his shocked girlfriend Billie
,Lauren Hutton, walk out on him in total disgust. <br><br>Walking aimlessly in the park Axel is grabbed by two mobsters and taken
to a mob hideout in the city. Given one last chance to pay up or else
they come up with what even Axel feels is something thats not worth his
life to do. He's told to get one of his students Spencer, Carl W.
Crudup, who's a top basketball player for the collage team to shave
points in a big game that he's playing in that evening with Axel giving
him $5,000.00 to do it. This act of corrupting an innocent person to
save his hide for the troubles that he got himself into was the straw
that broke the camels back for the now extremely tormented Axel and
finally opened his eyes, to not only what he was doing to himself but
to those around him as well. <br><br>With his debts now finally paid off and the mob off his back Axel
instead of being relived becomes suicidal and at the end of the movie
gambles with the most prized and valuable item in his possession: His
Life.

Her mother Gladys Pearl Baker was a film-cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. Marilyn\'s father\'s identity was never known. Because Gladys was mentally and financially unable to care for young Marilyn, Gladys placed her in the care of a foster family, The Bolenders. Although the Bolender family wanted to adopt Marilyn, Gladys was eventually able to stabilize her lifestyle and took Marilyn back in her care when Marilyn was 7 years old. However, shortly after regaining custody of Marilyn, Gladys had a complete mental breakdown and was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and was committed to a state mental hospital. Gladys spent the rest of her life going in and out of hospitals and did not have contact with Marilyn ever again. Gladys outlived her daughter, dying in 1984.Marilyn was then taken in by Gladys\' best friend Grace Goddard, who, after a series of foster homes, placed Marilyn into the Los Angeles Orphan\'s Home in 1935. Marilyn was traumatized by her experience there despite the Orphan\'s Home being an adequate living facility. Grace Goddard eventually took Marilyn back to live with her in 1937 although this stay did not last long as Grace\'s husband began molesting Marilyn. Marilyn went to live with Grace\'s Aunt Ana after this incident, although due to Aunt Ana\'s advanced age she could not care properly for Marilyn. Marilyn once again for the third time had to return to live with the Goddard\'s. The Goddard\'s planned to relocated and according to law, could not take Marilyn with them. She only had two choices: return to the orphanage or get married. Marilyn was only 16 years old.She decided to marry a neighborhood friend named James Dougherty; he went into the military, she modeled, they divorced in 1946. She owned 200 books (including Tolstoy, Whitman, Milton), listened to Beethoven records, studied acting at the Actors\' lab in Hollywood, and took literature courses at UCLA downtown. 20th Century Fox gave her a contract but let it lapse a year later. In 1948, Columbia gave her a six-month contract, turned her over to coach Natasha Lytess and featured her in the B movie Ladies of the Chorus (1948) in which she sang three numbers : ""Every Baby Needs a Da Da Daddy"", ""Anyone Can Tell I Love You"" and ""The Ladies of the Chorus"" with Adele Jergens (dubbed by Virginia Rees) and others. Joseph L. Mankiewicz saw her in a small part in The Asphalt Jungle (1950) and put her in All About Eve (1950), resulting in 20th Century re-signing her to a seven-year contract. Niagara (1953) and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) launched her as a sex symbol superstar.When she went to a supper honoring her in the The Seven Year Itch (1955), she arrived in a red chiffon gown borrowed from the studio (she had never owned a gown). That same year, she married and divorced baseball great Joe DiMaggio (their wedding night was spent in Paso Robles, California). After The Seven Year Itch (1955), she wanted serious acting to replace the sexpot image and went to New York\'s Actors Studio. She worked with director Lee Strasberg and also underwent psychoanalysis to learn more about herself. Critics praised her transformation in Bus Stop (1956) and the press was stunned by her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller. True to form, she had no veil to match her beige wedding dress so she dyed one in coffee; he wore one of the two suits he owned. They went to England that fall where she made The Prince and the Showgirl (1957) with Laurence Olivier, fighting with him and falling further prey to alcohol and pills. Two miscarriages and gynecological surgery followed. So did an affair with Yves Montand. Work on her last picture The Misfits (1961), written for her by departing husband Miller was interrupted by exhaustion. She was dropped from the unfinished Something\'s Got to Give (1962) due to chronic lateness and drug dependency.On August 4, 1962, Marilyn Monroe\'s day began with threatening phone calls. Dr. Ralph Greenson, Marilyn\'s physician, came over the following day and quoted later in a document ""felt it was possible that Marilyn Monroe had felt rejected by some of the people she had been close to"". Apart from being upset that her publicist slept too long, she seemed fine. Pat Newcombe, who had stayed the previous night at Marilyn\'s house, left in the early evening as did Greenson who had a dinner date. Marilyn was upset he couldn\'t stay, and around 7:30pm she telephoned him while she was to tell him that her second husband\'s son had called him. Peter Lawford also called Marilyn, inviting her to dinner, but she declined. Lawford later said her speech was slurred. As the dark and depressing evening for Marilyn wore on there were other phone calls, including one from Jose Belanos, who said he thought she sounded fine. According to the funeral directors, Marilyn died sometime between 9:30pm and 11:30pm. Her maid unable to raise her but seeing a light under her locked door, called the police shortly after midnight. She also phoned Ralph Greenson who, on arrival, could not break down the bedroom door. He eventually broke in through French windows and found Marilyn dead in bed. The coroner stated she had died from acute barbiturate poisoning, and it was a \'probable suicide\'.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Ed Stephan <stephan@cc.wwu.edu>                    Probably the most celebrated of all actresses, Marilyn Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson on June 1, 1926, in the charity ward of the Los Angeles General Hospital. Prior to her birth, Marilyn\'s father bought a motorcycle and headed north to San Francisco, abandoning the family in Los Angeles. Marilyn grew up not knowing for sure who her father really was. Her mother, Gladys, had entered into several relationships, further confusing her daughter as to who it was who fathered her. Afterward, Gladys gave Norma Jeane (Marilyn) the name of Baker, a boyfriend she had before Mortenson. Poverty was a constant companion to Gladys and Norma. Gladys, who was extremely attractive and worked for RKO Studios as a filmcutter, suffered from mental illness and was in and out of mental institutions for the rest of her life, and because of that Norma Jeane spent time in foster homes. When she was nine, she was placed in an orphanage where she was to stay for the next two years. Upon being released from the orphanage, she went to yet another foster home. In 1942, at age 16, Norma Jeane married 21-year-old aircraft plant worker James Dougherty. The marriage only lasted four years, and they divorced in 1946. By this time, Marilyn began to model swimsuits and bleached her hair blonde. Various shots made their way into the public eye, where some were eventually seen by RKO Pictures head Howard Hughes. He offered Marilyn a screen test, but an agent suggested that 20th Century-Fox would be the better choice for her, since it was a much bigger and more prestigious studio. She was signed to a contract at $125 per week for a six-month period and that was increased by $25 per week at the end of that time when her contract was lengthened.Her first film was in 1947 with a bit part in The Shocking Miss Pilgrim (1947). Her next production was not much better, a bit in the eminently forgettable Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay! (1948). Two of the three brief scenes in which she appeared wound up on the cutting room floor. Later that same year, she was given a somewhat better role as Evie in Dangerous Years (1947). However, Fox declined to renew her contract, so she went back to modeling and acting school.Columbia Pictures then picked her up to play Peggy Martin in Ladies of the Chorus (1948), where she sang two numbers. Notices from the critics were favorable for her, if not the film, but Columbia dropped her. Once again Marilyn returned to modeling. In 1949, she appeared in United Artists\' Love Happy (1949). It was also that same year she posed nude for the now famous calendar shot which was later to appear in Playboy magazine in 1953 and further boost her career. She would be the first centerfold in that magazine\'s long and illustrious history. The next year proved to be a good year for Marilyn. She appeared in five films, but the good news was that she received very good notices for her roles in two of them, The Asphalt Jungle (1950) from MGM and All About Eve (1950) from Fox. Even though both roles were basically not much more than bit parts, movie fans remembered her dizzy but very sexy blonde performance.In 1951, Marilyn got a fairly sizable role in Love Nest (1951). The public was now getting to know her and liked what it saw. She had an intoxicating quality of volcanic sexuality wrapped in an aura of almost childlike innocence. In 1952, Marilyn appeared in Don\'t Bother to Knock (1952), in which she played a somewhat mentally unbalanced babysitter. Critics didn\'t particularly care for her work in this picture, but she made a much more favorable impression later in the year in Monkey Business (1952), where she was seen for the first time as a platinum blonde, a look that became her trademark. The next year, she appeared in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) as Lorelei Lee. It was also the same year she began dating the baseball great Joe DiMaggio.Marilyn was now a genuine box-office drawing card. Later, she appeared with Betty Grable, Lauren Bacall and Rory Calhoun in How to Marry a Millionaire (1953). Although her co-stars got the rave reviews, it was the sight of Marilyn that really excited the audience, especially the male members. On Thursday, January 14th, 1954, Marilyn wed DiMaggio, then proceeded to film There\'s No Business Like Show Business (1954). That was quickly followed by The Seven Year Itch (1955), which showcased her considerable comedic talent and contained what is arguably one of the most memorable moments in cinema history: Marilyn standing above a subway grating and the wind from a passing subway blowing her white dress up.By October 1954, Marilyn announced her divorce from DiMaggio. The union lasted only eight months. In 1955, she was suspended by Fox for not reporting for work on How to Be Very, Very Popular (1955). It was her second suspension, the first being for not reporting for the production of The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955). Both roles went to others. Her work was slowing down, due to her habit of being continually late to the set, her illnesses (whether real or imagined) and generally being unwilling to cooperate with her producers, directors, and fellow actors.However in Bus Stop (1956), Marilyn finally showed critics that she could play a straight dramatic role. It was also the same year she married playwright, Arthur Miller (they divorced in 1960). In 1957, Marilyn flew to Britain to film The Prince and the Showgirl (1957) which proved less than impressive critically and financially. It made money, but many critics panned it for being slow-moving. After a year off in 1958, Marilyn returned to the screen the next year for the delightful comedy, Some Like It Hot (1959) with Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. The film was an absolute smash hit, with Curtis and Lemmon pretending to be females in an all-girl band, so they can get work. This was to be Marilyn\'s only film for the year.In 1960, Marilyn appeared in George Cukor\'s Let\'s Make Love (1960), with Tony Randall and Yves Montand. Again, while it made money, it was critically panned as stodgy and slow-moving. The following year, Marilyn made what was to be her final film. The Misfits (1961), which also proved to be the final film for the legendary Clark Gable, who died later that year of a heart attack. The film was popular with critics and the public alike. In 1962, Marilyn was chosen to star in Fox\'s Something\'s Got to Give (1962). Again, her absenteeism caused delay after delay in production, resulting in her being fired from the production in June of that year. It looked as though her career was finished. Studios just didn\'t want to take a chance on her because it would cost them thousands of dollars in delays. She was only 36 years old.Marilyn made only 30 films in her lifetime, but her legendary status and mysticism will remain with film history forever.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Denny Jackson          Spouse (3) Arthur Miller (29 June\xa01956            - 20 January\xa01961)\xa0(divorced)           Joe DiMaggio (14 January\xa01954            - 31 October\xa01955)\xa0(divorced)           James Dougherty (19 June\xa01942            - 13 September\xa01946)\xa0(divorced)          Trade Mark (4)        Lisp, breathless voice        Platinum blonde hair        Voluptuous figure        Beauty spot on cheekTrivia (134)      Voted \'Sexiest Woman of the Century\' by People Magazine. [1999]      Was 1947\'s Miss California Artichoke Queen.      In her autobiography, ""My Story"", ghost-written by Ben Hecht, she recounted her guardian told her she was a direct descendant of James Monroe. Her mother\'s maiden name was Monroe, but there is no evidence she was a descendant of the U.S. President.      Was roommates with Shelley Winters when they were both starting out in Hollywood.      Ranked #8 in Empire (UK) magazine\'s ""The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time"" list. [October 1997]      Voted Empire\'s (UK) ""sexiest female movie star of all time"" in 1995.      She was Playboy\'s first ""Sweetheart of the Month"" in December 1953.      When she died in 1962 at age 36, she left an estate valued at $1.6 million. In her will, Monroe bequeathed 75% of that estate to Lee Strasberg, her acting coach, and 25% to Dr. Marianne Kris, her psychoanalyst. A trust fund provided her mother, Gladys Baker Eley, with $5,000 a year. When Dr. Kris died in 1980, she passed her 25% on to the Anna Freud Centre, a children\'s psychiatric institute in London. Since Strasberg\'s death in 1982, his 75% has been administered by his widow, Anna, and her lawyer, Irving Seidman.      The licensing of Marilyn\'s name and likeness, handled world-wide by Curtis Management Group, reportedly nets the Monroe estate about $2 million a year.      Was named the Number One Sex Star of the 20th Century by Playboy magazine in 1999.      Started using the name Marilyn Monroe in 1946, but did not legally change it until 1956.

She was discovered dead at her home at 12305 Fifth Helena Drive, Brentwood, California. She had a phone in one of her hands, her body was completely nude and face down, on her bed.      Ex-husband Joe DiMaggio put fresh roses at her memorial site, for numerous years after her death.      When putting her imprints at Grauman\'s she joked that Jane Russell was best known for her large front-side and she was known for her wiggly walk, so Jane could lean over, and she could sit in it. It was only a joke, but she dotted the ""I"" in her name with a rhinestone, which was stolen within days.      Redheaded actress Tina Louise played the character role of Ginger Grant on the television series Gilligan\'s Island (1964), was loosely based on her personality, but a different hair color.      Her first modeling job paid only five dollars.      Frequently used Nivea moisturizer.      During the filming of Niagara (1953), she was still under contract as a stock actor, thus, she received less salary than her make-up man. This was also the only film in which her character died. The film was reworked to highlight her after Anne Bancroft withdrew.      Often carried around the book, ""The Biography of Abraham Lincoln.""      Was an outstanding player on the Hollygrove Orphanage softball team.      Because the bathing suit she wore in the movie Love Nest (1951) was so risque (for the time period) and caused such a commotion on the set, director Joseph M. Newman had to make it a closed set when she was filming.      Fearing blemishes and sweat, she washed her face fifteen times a day.      She was suggested as a possible wife for Prince Rainier of Monaco. But he picked actress, Grace Kelly, to be his wife.      Thought the right side of her face was her ""best"" side.      The first time she signed an autograph as Marilyn Monroe, she had to ask how to spell it. She didn\'t know where to put the ""i"" in ""Marilyn"".      Born on Tuesday at 9:30 AM, Pacific Standard Time, which is Los Angeles, California\'s time zone.      Suffered from endometriosis, a condition in which tissues of the uterus lining (endometrium) leave the uterus, attach themselves to other areas of the body, and grow, causing pain, irregular bleeding, and, in severe cases, infertility.      Divorced first husband, James Dougherty, in Las Vegas, Nevada.      Divorced last husband, Arthur Miller, in Juarez, Mexico.      Wore glasses.      On Thursday, February 23rd, 1956, she obtained order from the City Court of the State of New York to legally change her name from Norma Jeane Mortenson to Marilyn Monroe.      Married Arthur Miller twice: the 1st time in a civil ceremony, then in a Jewish (to which she had converted) ceremony two days later.      Won an interlocutory decree from Joe DiMaggio on Wednesday, October 27th, 1954, but, under California law, the divorce was not finalized until exactly one year later.      Offered to convert to Catholism in order to marry Joe DiMaggio in a Church ceremony, but she was turned down because she was divorced. Subsequently, when the divorced DiMaggio married Marilyn in a civil ceremony at San Francisco City Hall, he was automatically excommunicated by the Church; this edict was struck down by Pope John XXIII\'s Ecumenical Council (Vatican II) in 1962.      Although it\'s believed that her mother, Gladys Baker, named her after Norma Talmadge, Gladys reportedly told her daughter, Bernice (Marilyn\'s half-sister), that she named Marilyn after Norma Jeane Cohen, a child she was Nanny to while living in Louisville, KY. while her son Robert Kermit Baker (Marilyn\'s half brother) was in Hospital, and estranged from the father Jasper Baker. The boy died, and Gladys returned to California.      The first stamp released in the USPS\'s Legends of Hollywood series, issued on Friday, June 1st, 1995.      Went to Van Nuys High School (Los Angeles) in the early 1940s but never graduated.      In 1973, Elton John released a single in tribute to her entitled ""Candle in the Wind"". In 1997, it was re-recorded with updated lyrics in memory of Princess Diana, becoming the UK\'s best-selling single of all time. Def Leppard\'s single ""Photograph"" from their ""Pyromania"" album was also written about Monroe. Glenn Danzig, lead singer of the punk band The Misfits, recorded a song called ""Who Killed Marilyn?"", inspired by his belief that she had been murdered. She is mentioned in the lyrics of several other songs, including ""Celluloid Heroes"" by The Kinks, ""We Didn\'t Start the Fire"" by Billy Joel, ""Vogue"" by Madonna, ""Lady Nina"" by rock band Marillion and ""Tell Me It\'s Not True"" from the musical ""Blood Brothers"".      Her behavior on the unfinished Something\'s Got to Give (1962) dimmed her reputation in the industry, but she was still big box office at the time of her death. What a Way to Go! (1964) and The Stripper (1963) were being developed for her.      When she was told that she was not the star in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) she verbally said ""Well whatever I am, I\'m still the blonde."".      The famous nude photo of her by Tom Kelley originally appeared as anonymous on a calendar entitled ""Miss Golden Dreams."" In 1952, a blackmailer threatened to identify the model as Marilyn, but she shrewdly thwarted the scheme by announcing the fact herself. Hugh M. Hefner then bought the rights to use the photo for $500. She became ""The Sweetheart of the Month"" in the first issue of Hefner\'s magazine, Playboy. Neither Kelley or Monroe ever saw a dime of the millions the calendar made for its publisher.      Formed her own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions, with Milton H. Greene, on December 31, 1955.      Appears on sleeve of The Beatles\' ""Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band"" album.      Batman writer/artist Bob Kane used Marilyn\'s likeness as a reference when he drew Vicki Vale.      Her USO Entertainer Identification Card (#129778) listed her name as ""Norma Jeane DiMaggio"".      She was ""discovered"" by press photographers during a World War II photo shoot at the Radioplane plant in California owned by actor Reginald Denny. She was one of the plant\'s employees. She left her job and signed with Emmeline Snively\'s modeling agency.      Was referenced in the dialogue of La dolce vita (1960), in the context of dieting.      The Emily Ann Faulkner/Rita Shawn character (played by Kim Stanley) in the John Cromwell film The Goddess (1958) was based on her.      The first Playboy magazine cover, featuring her, is pictured on one of six stamps issued in a souvenir sheet, issued by Grenada & the Grenadines on Saturday, December 1st, 2003 to celebrate Playboy\'s 50th and golden anniversary.      When she wasn\'t acting, she preferred to wear nothing but a bathrobe and occasionally a bikini.      Named 2nd Greatest Movie Star of all time by Premier Magazine, behind #1 Cary Grant and before #3 Tom Cruise.      The punk band The Misfits created or picked their name from the last movie title she acted in, The Misfits (1961).      Featured on a 1.11 euro postage stamp issued by French Post Office on Saturday, November 8th, 2003.      The very popular version of ""Santa Baby"" (also found in the film, Party Monster (2003)) thought to be sung by her was instead recorded by Cynthia Basinet for Jack Nicholson as a Christmas gift.      Ten days in advance, on Saturday, May 19th, 1962, she performed for U.S. President John F. Kennedy at his 45th birthday tribute in his honor at Madison Square Garden. She sang ""Happy Birthday"". (Kennedy\'s real birthday was May 29th).      After discovering her dress was torn, at the 1950 Academy Awards, she burst into tears.      Was named #6 Actress on The American Film Institute\'s 50 Greatest Screen Legends.      The dress Marilyn Monroe wore to serenade John F. Kennedy, on May 19, 1962 at his birthday celebration was so tight, that it had to be sewn onto her. She had to sit still for approximately an hour.      In 1999, a make-up kit that she personally owned, sold for $266,500.      One of the first Los Angeles natives to become a major movie star.      Aside from her birth name of Norma Jeane Mortenson, she was baptized and mainly known throughout her life as Norma Jeane Baker. During her modeling days she was also known as Norma Jeane Dougherty (her first marriage name), and also as Jean Norman. When she signed with 20th Century-Fox, studio casting executive Ben Lyon had first chosen the name Carol Lind as her stage name, although she disliked that. Eventually she chose her mother\'s maiden name of Monroe. Three names were drawn up as possible stage names. The first was Norma Jeane Monroe, although that sounded awkward; the second was Jean Monroe, and the third was Marilyn Monroe, the latter first name being chosen by Lyon who thought Norma Jeane resembled famed stage actress Marilyn Miller. Norma Jeane liked Jean Monroe, for it preserved some of her name, but Lyon convinced her that Marilyn Monroe sounded more alliterative and so it was chosen.      She took acting lessons from Michael Chekhov.Sergei Parajanov made collages of Monroe, Charles Chaplin, Mona Lisa, and other famous personages and many were featured in Mikhail Vartanov\'s Parajanov: The Last Spring (1992).      A 1982 review into the original inquest of Marilyn\'s death, conducted on its 20-year anniversary, concluded that the actress committed suicide or accidentally overdosed, and was not murdered--rumors that were fueled by the sloppy handling of evidence, the delay in securing the scene and the disappearance of tissue samples.      The ADR stage at Twentieth Century Fox is named after her.      In 1972, actress Veronica Hamel and her husband became the new owners of Marilyn\'s Brentwood home. They hired a contractor to replace the roof and remodel the house, and the contractor discovered a sophisticated eavesdropping and telephone tapping system that covered every room in the house. The components were not commercially available in 1962, but were in the words of a retired Justice Department official, ""standard FBI issue."" This discovery lent further support to claims of conspiracy theorists that Marilyn had been under surveillance by the Kennedys and the Mafia. The new owners spent $100,000 to remove the bugging devices from the house.      Was good friends with Dorothy Dandridge and Ava Gardner when they were all young, struggling actresses in Hollywood.      When budding actresses Shelley Winters and Marilyn were roommates in the late 1940s in Hollywood, Shelley said that one day she had to step out and asked Marilyn to ""wash the lettuce"" for a salad they were to share for dinner. When Shelley got back to the apartment, (Marilyn was apparently new to the art of cooking) had the leaves of lettuce in a small tub of soapy water and was scrubbing them clean. She had not heard of the phrase before either, or did not know it\'s true meaning.      Her real father was Charles Stanley Gifford. From his side, she was descended from the founder of Rhode Island, Roger Williams, and religious leader Anne Marbury-Hutchinson, from whom she is related to Lucretia Rudolph (wife of President James A. Garfield), Grover Cleveland, William Howard Taft, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, George Bush, and George W. Bush.      In How to Marry a Millionaire (1953), her character Pola is reading a book called ""Murder By Strangulation"" on the plane. Coincidentally, this is how her character was murdered in Niagara (1953).      Friend of James Haspiel.Don\'t Bother to Knock (1952) (her 18th film) was an attempt to prove to critics that she could act successfully. Because some earlier films took numerous takes and much longer time to complete. Especially, The Seven Year Itch (1955) which took numerous extra takes, for her character role, alone.      In Italy, her films were dubbed at the beginning of her career by Miranda Bonansea. As she matured she was dubbed by the marvellous and prolific Rosetta Calavetta with immense success, particularly in Some Like It Hot (1959). Zoe Incrocci lent her voice to Monroe once: in All About Eve (1950).      Her lifelong bouts with depression and self-destruction took their toll during filming The Seven Year Itch (1955). She frequently muffed scenes and forgot her lines, leading to sometimes as many as 40 takes of a scene before a satisfactory result was produced. Her constant tardiness and behavioral problems made the budget of the film swell to $1.8 million, a high price for the time. The film still managed to make a nice profit. The classic shot of her dress blowing up around her legs as she stands over a subway grating in this film was originally shot on Manhattan\'s Lexington Avenue at 52nd St., On Wednesday, September 15th, 1954, at 1:00 a.m. Five thousand onlookers whistled and cheered through take after take as Marilyn repeatedly missed her lines. This occurred in presence of an increasingly embarrassed and angry Joe DiMaggio (her husband at the time; the nine-month-old marriage officially ended during the shooting of this film). The original footage shot on that night in New York never made it to the screen; the noise of the crowd had made it unusable. Director Billy Wilder re-shot the scene on the 20th Century-Fox lot, on a set replicating Lexington Avenue, and got a more satisfactory result. However, it took another 40 takes for Marilyn to achieve the famous scene. Amazingly, her very narrow spike heels don\'t get stuck or break in the subway grating, although this was a universal problem at the time for the countless women wearing that very popular style heel in New York City in that era. An important promotional campaign was released for this mainstream motion picture, including a 52-foot-high cutout of Marilyn (from the blowing dress scene) erected in front of Loews State Theater, in New York City\'s Times Square. The movie premiere was on June 1, 1955, which was also her 29th birthday.      Was originally set to play Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany\'s (1961), but Audrey Hepburn played the role instead.What a Way to Go! (1964) initially intended as a vehicle for her, Shirley MacLaine played Louisa May Foster instead. Producer Arthur P. Jacobs was her publicist and J. Lee Thompson was on her list of approved directors.      She resided at the Hollywood Roosevelt while she was breaking into the acting business.      Her ""Happy Birthday Mr. President"" dress sold for $1,267,500.00, a world record for the most expensive piece of clothing ever sold, and is in the Guinness Book of World Records.      She left Hollywood to pursue serious acting by studying under Lee Strasberg at his Actors\' Studio in New York City.      Her classic shape, according to her dressmaker, is actually measured at 37-23-36.      In 1946, she signed her first studio contract with 20th Century Fox and dyed her hair.      Spent most of her early childhood in foster homes and orphanages because her mother was committed to a mental institution. Later, she lived with her mother\'s best friend, Grace McKee, and her family. McKee, a big fan of Jean Harlow, allowed her to wear make-up and curl her hair and, when she was 15, it was McKee who pierced her ears for her using a sewing needle. At 16, when McKee could no longer take care of her, she got married to avoid returning to the orphanage.      Producer Keya Morgan owns her Bible.      When she married Joe DiMaggio, the couple moved into a home at 508 N. Palm Drive in Beverly Hills, that was next door to Jean Harlow\'s last home.      She tried 9 different shades of blonde hair color before settling on platinum blonde.      Her personal library contained over 400 books on topics ranging from art to history, psychology, philosophy, literature, religion, poetry, and gardening. Many of the volumes, auctioned in 1999, bore her pencil notations in the margins.      There are over 600 books written about her.      Nearly 11 years after her death, she appeared on the cover of the Tuesday, July 17th, 1973 edition of ""Time Magazine"" in a full-color portrait taken by Bert Stern, from the last photographic sitting before her death. The cover-story heralds the publication of ""Marilyn,"" the biography of her by Norman Mailer. On the cover, her image dwarfs a black & white photo of Mailer. Mailer reportedly was displeased that ""Time"" chose to play up Monroe and diminish him, visually on the cover. The publication of the coffee table biography, which contained many photographs including several by Stern, was a major event of that publishing season. The book retailed for $19.95, which is approximately $100 in 2008 money, when factored for inflation.      ""Time Magazine"" reported in 1973 that Los Angeles County coroner Thomas Noguchi, the doctor who performed Monroe\'s autopsy, said that contrary to rumors, Monroe\'s stomach was never pumped after her death. The level of Nembutal in her bloodstream was 4.5 milligrams per 100, which is the equivalent of 40 or 50 capsules indicating suicide.      In 1961, after her divorce from Arthur Miller, she purchased a 2900 square foot hacienda style house in Brentwood, for $77,500.      Featured in ""Femme Noir: Bad Girls of Film"" by Karen Burroughs Hannsberry (McFarland, 1998).      Her last film Something\'s Got to Give (1962), was finally released in 2003. In the swimming pool scene, Marilyn reveals much more to the camera than she did in her then controversial calendar photo from the early 1950s.      Was in consideration for the part of Adelaide in Guys and Dolls (1955), but Vivian Blaine was cast instead.      Although she was perhaps the most famous actress of the 1950s decade, she never made more than $100,000 per picture upfront. Actresses such as Elizabeth Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck were earning significantly more.      Former stepmother of Robert A. Miller.      Half-sister of Berniece and Robert Kermitt Baker (but she never knew him, because he died at 14) by her mother\'s side. Sister-in-law of Paris Miracle, aunt of Mona Rae Miracle.      Became pregnant twice (in July 1957 and November 1958) during her marriage to Arthur Miller; on both occasions she suffered miscarriages.      Although she was an avid buyer of books and owned over 400 of them at her death, third husband Arthur Miller said, ""Aside from Colette\'s Cheri and a few short stories, I had never known her to read anything all the way through. She felt she could get the idea of a book, and often did, in just a few pages."".      Read and wrote poetry.      Ranked #3 in Men\'s Health 100 Hottest Women of all Time (2011).      Was a lifelong liberal Democrat.      Was close friends with singer Ella Fitzgerald and helped her rise in her musical career by arranging for her to sing in many upscale nightclubs some of which were segregated during the time of their friendship.      Monroe was a stutterer, a little known fact that was easily covered thanks to studio vocal coaches who provided her with diction lessons.      Learned to play the guitar for her role in River of No Return (1954) and the ukulele for her role in Some Like It Hot (1959).      Former sister-in-law of Joan Copeland, Vince DiMaggio, and Dominic DiMaggio. She and Joan shared the same birthday (June 1).      Film editor Dann Cahn recommended a young woman he was dating for the part of a beautiful young woman in Your Show Time (1949). Producer Stanley Rubin auditioned her and turned her down because she did not have enough experience. The young woman\'s name was Marilyn Monroe.      She was scheduled for The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955), but she was thought too old at 30 when the character was supposed to be 17 so she was replaced with Joan Collins.      According to Adam Curtis\' ""The Century of Self"", Monroe was in the later years subjected to an experimental kind of therapy where she was forced to attend the rituals of an average family and then expected to model her self upon the experience. Arthur Miller commented in the same documentary ""I don\'t think suffering is always a mistake"".Ayn Rand wrote a powerful tribute to her, compiled in ""The Voice of Reason"".      Although Monroe\'s famous nude calender grossed $750,000, the actress only got $50 and a bad cold out of it.      After working with Monroe in As Young as You Feel (1951) jealous co-star Constance Bennett wisecracked, ""Now there\'s a broad with a future behind her!"".      Among roles that Monroe turned down under her Fox contract: ""Pink Tights,"" ""How To Be Very, Very Popular,"" ""The Revolt of Mamie Stover,"" ""The Girl in the Red velvet Swing,\' ""The Jean Harlow Story,"" ""The Blue Angel,"" and ""Can-Can."".      She campaigned to play the Maria Schell role in ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" but she was never seriously considered.      According to the book ""Flesh and Fantasy"" Monroe perfected a Vaseline-based lip gloss.      ""Goodbye, Charlie"" with Debbie Reynolds, and ""The Stripper"" with Joanne Woodward were originally slated by Fox as Monroe projects.      Director Billy Wilder was quoted as saying, ""The great success of Monroe... was that she did not infuriate the female."".      Was good friends with Judy Garland.      Played by Mary Hanson in Hollywood Mouth 2 (2014). The director of that film, Jordan Mohr, had portrayed Marilyn\'s rival Simone Signoret in the stage play ""Two Simones: de Beauvoir and Signoret in Hollywood"".      Richard Widmark on co-starring with Monroe in ""Don\'t Bother to Knock"": ""She was a vulnerable kid. Murder to work with because she was scared to death of acting - even when she became a big movie actress. We had a hell of a time getting her out of the dressing room. When it was five o\'clock , it got irritating: \'C\'mon, Marilyn, we want to go home!\' She was a movie animal. Something happened between the lens and the film. Nobody knew what the hell it was. On the set, you\'d think: \'Oh, this is impossible; you can\'t print this.\' You\'d see it, and she\'s got everyone backed off the screen. Olivier said the same thing. She had that phenomenal something! Nobody knows what it is, but she had it. She certainly was never a professional actress. She always had a coach with her, lurking in the background, giving her signals. And she could never remember three words in a row - so it was all piece-work. Beyond all the technical deficiencies, she was a nice girl. We got along fine."".      Is one of 20 actresses who did not receive an Oscar nomination for their Best Actress in a Comedy/Musical Golden Globe-winning performance; hers being for Some Like It Hot (1959). The others, in chronological order, are: June Allyson for Too Young to Kiss (1951), Ethel Merman for Call Me Madam (1953), Jean Simmons for Guys and Dolls (1955), Taina Elg and Kay Kendall for Les Girls (1957), Rosalind Russell for A Majority of One (1961) and Gypsy (1962), Patty Duke for Me, Natalie (1969), Twiggy for The Boy Friend (1971), Raquel Welch for The Three Musketeers (1973), Barbra Streisand for A Star Is Born (1976), Bernadette Peters for Pennies from Heaven (1981), Kathleen Turner for Romancing the Stone (1984) and Prizzi\'s Honor (1985), Miranda Richardson for Enchanted April (1991), Jamie Lee Curtis for True Lies (1994), Nicole Kidman for To Die For (1995), Madonna for Evita (1996), Renée Zellweger for Nurse Betty (2000), Sally Hawkins for Happy-Go-Lucky (2008), and Amy Adams for Big Eyes (2014).      Egypt banned all her films after her conversion to Judaism in 1956.      One of Hajime Sorayama\'s ""Gynoids"" is based on her iconic pose from ""The Seven Year Itch"".      In order to fall asleep quicker and stay asleep longer she often mixed champagne with sleeping pills.      Became friends with Exotic Animal Trainer Ralph Helfer while working together in the movie River of No Return (1954) and got very attached to his Raccoon named Bandit.      In November 2016, the dress worn by Monroe while singing ""Happy Birthday"" to President John F. Kennedy at his 1962 birthday celebration was sold for $4.8 million, a record amount for a dress sold at auction. This surpassed the previous record for a dress sold at auction, which was also held by a dress worn by Monroe: the white dress she wore in The Seven Year Itch (1955) fetched $4.6 million in 2011.      Marilyn Monroe was 36 when she was found dead in her Beverly Hills-West Hollywood home on an early Sunday morning, August 5, 1962, just less than two and a half months after she appeared at New York City\'s Madison Square Garden, on a Saturday evening, May 19, 1962. The event was staged and produced by Broadway composer and lyricist Richard Adler. It was choreographed by Carol Haney of ""The Pajama Game"" fame. The Democratic event rally was a fund raising gala for the Democratic Party, the evening\'s program highlight, a celebration of John F. Kennedy\'s forty-fifth birthday, ten days before his actual birth-date on Tuesday, May 29, 1962, before 15,000 invited guests, Marilyn Monroe to sing ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President"" to President John F. Kennedy. Monroe sang the traditional ""Happy Birthday to You"" lyrics in a sultry, intimate voice, with ""Mr. President"" inserted as Kennedy\'s name. She continued the song with a snippet from the classic song, ""Thanks for the Memory"", for which she had written new lyrics specifically aimed at Kennedy. ""Thanks, Mr. President, For all the things you\'ve done, The battles that you\'ve won, The way you deal with U.S. Steel, And our problems by the ton, We thank you so much."" That moment in New York City, as we look back on it today in a grainy video, is frozen in time with all its possibilities still before it. We see celebration, joy, life. And we know too much about the future. Maybe that\'s why the gown Marilyn wore is worth $4.8 million. Because people will line up to see it, to stand next to something that once sparkled in the presence of greatness, of triumph, of happiness. The gown that broke the November 2016 auction record, was a creation of Hollywood film costume designer Jean Louis, with the original sketch executed by 19 year old costume illustrator Bob Mackie. Made of sheer silk marquisette-gauze fabric, the flesh-colored gown was hand-sewn with over 2,500 rhinestone-crystals, originally cost $1,440.33. It was tailored by an atelier so close to the body that Monroe was sewn into it before she walked onto the stage. The dress sold in 1999 at an auction in New York for over US $1.26 million. A new bidder subsequently purchased the dress in November 17, 2016. Peter Lawford was at the event that night to introduce Monroe. He made a play on the actress\'s reputation for tardiness by giving her a number of introductions throughout the night, building anticipation, after which she did not appear on stage. When Monroe finally appeared in a spotlight, Lawford introduced her as the ""late Marilyn Monroe"". Monroe peeled off her white ermine fur coat, revealing the dress, and the audience gasped. The film video of the event when actor Peter Lawford includes the downright eerie introduction of Monroe\'s missed cue for her entrance. ""Mr. President,"" Lawford says, leaning into the microphone, ""the LATE Marilyn Monroe."" As Lawford takes her white ermine coat, a thousand voices in the audience let out a gasp of ""Oh!"" at the sight of the gown, and the woman underneath it. According to Los Angeles\' Julien\'s Auctions, Marilyn was the only thing underneath the sheer gown, the dress was so tight that Monroe wore nothing else. Rumors of an affair between the president and the film star were sparked by the absence of Jacqueline Kennedy from the 45th birthday celebration, and by the sultry and suggestive performance. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who rarely attended Democratic Party events, spent the day at the Loudon Hunt Horse Show with her children John-John and Caroline. ""I can now retire from politics after having had \'Happy Birthday\' sung to me in such a sweet, wholesome manner,"" alluding to Marilyn\'s delivery, skintight dress, and image as a sex symbol, JFK said, when he stood alone at the lectern a few minutes later. Monroe had been spirited away from the microphone while the cameras were distracted by the entrance of an enormous birthday cake carried in on the shoulders of two men in chefs\' jackets. The November, 2016, buyer Ripley\'s Entertainment Inc., the company that operates ""Ripley\'s Believe It or Not! Museum"" in Hollywood, California, paid $4.8 million at auction. The company plans to display the dress there and also take it on tour. In 2017, Ripley\'s is celebrating its 100th year anniversary, and the ""Marilyn Monroe\'s \'Happy Birthday, Mr. President\' gown"" will be prominently featured, as it should be. Surviving to 100 and still overspending on dresses is something to celebrate. JFK was assassinated at age 46, eighteen months later after his Madison Square Garden 45th ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President"" birthday celebration, at 12:30pm Central Time, on a Friday noon motorcade parade, November 22, 1963, in Dealy Plaza in Dallas, Texas.      Subject of song ""Marilyn Monroe"" by Phoebe Legere.      Born on the same day as Andy Griffith.Personal Quotes (116)      I love a natural look in pictures. I like people with a feeling one way or another - it shows an inner life. I like to see that there\'s something going on inside them.      My problem is that I drive myself... I\'m trying to become an artist, and to be true, and sometimes I feel I\'m on the verge of craziness, I\'m just trying to get the truest part of myself out, and it\'s very hard. There are times when I think, \'All I have to be is true\'. But sometimes it doesn\'t come out so easily. I always have this secret feeling that I\'m really a fake or something, a phony.      [on living with the Bolenders when she was a little girl] They were terribly strict. They didn\'t mean any harm . . . it was their religion. They brought me up harshly.      [on meeting Joe DiMaggio for the first time] I was surprised to be so crazy about Joe. I expected a flashy New York sports type, and instead I met this reserved guy who didn\'t make a pass at me right away! He treated me like something special. Joe is a very decent man, and he makes other people feel decent, too.      [on why Joe DiMaggio didn\'t accompany her on one of her USO tours] Joe hates crowds and glamor.      [on why she divorced James Dougherty] My marriage didn\'t make me sad, but it didn\'t make me happy either. My husband and I hardly spoke to each other. This wasn\'t because we were angry. We had nothing to say. I was dying of boredom.      [on why her marriage to Joe DiMaggio didn\'t work] I didn\'t want to give up my career, and that\'s what Joe wanted me to do most of all.      I want to be a big star more than anything. It\'s something precious.      [on her favorite actress] Jean Harlow was my idol.      [on drifting in and out of orphanages when she was little] The world around me then was kind of grim. I had to learn to pretend in order to - I don\'t know - block the grimness. The whole world seemed sort of closed to me . . . [I felt] on the outside of everything, and all I could do was to dream up any kind of pretend game.      [on her early marriage to James Dougherty] Grace McKee arranged the marriage for me, I never had a choice. There\'s not much to say about it. They couldn\'t support me, and they had to work out something. And so I got married.      I\'m not interested in money, I just want to be wonderful.      A career is wonderful, but you can\'t curl up with it on a cold night.      Sometimes I think it would be easier to avoid old age, to die, young, but then you\'d never complete your life, would you? You\'d never wholly know yourself...      A dollar for your thoughts...      I\'ve been on a calendar, but never on time.      No one ever told me I was pretty when I was a little girl. All little girls should be told they\'re pretty, even if they aren\'t.      In Hollywood a girl\'s virtue is much less important than her hairdo. You\'re judged by how you look, not by what you are. Hollywood\'s a place where they\'ll pay you a thousand dollars for kiss, and fifty cents for your soul. I know, because I turned down the first offer often enough and held out for the fifty.      Dogs never bite me. Just humans.      Sex is a part of nature. I go along with nature.      Fame will go by and, so long, I\'ve had you, Fame. If it goes by, I\'ve always known it was fickle.      I knew I belonged to the public and to the world, not because I was talented or even beautiful, but because I never had belonged to anything or anyone else.      People had a habit of looking at me as if I were some kind of mirror instead of a person. They didn\'t see me, they saw their own lewd thoughts, then they white-masked themselves by calling me the lewd one.      A sex-symbol becomes a thing, I just hate being a thing. But if I\'m going to be a symbol of something I\'d rather have it sex than some other things we\'ve got symbols of.      The truth is I\'ve never fooled anyone. I\'ve let people fool themselves. They didn\'t bother to find out who and what I was. Instead they would invent a character for me. I wouldn\'t argue with them. They were obviously loving somebody I wasn\'t. When they found this out, they would blame me for disillusioning them---and fooling them.      To put it bluntly, I seem to have a whole superstructure with no foundation. But I\'m working on the foundation.      If I had observed all the rules, I\'d never have gotten anywhere.      I want to grow old without face-lifts... I want to have the courage to be loyal to the face that I have made.      It\'s often just enough to be with someone. I don\'t need to touch them. Not even talk. A feeling passes between you both. You\'re not alone.      I\'m a failure as a woman. My men expect so much of me, because of the image they\'ve made of me and that I\'ve made of myself, as a sex symbol. Men expect so much, and I can\'t live up to it.      It stirs up envy, fame does. People you run into feel that, well, who does she think she is, Marilyn Monroe? They feel fame gives them some kind of privilege to walk up to you and say anything to you, you know, of any kind of nature - and it won\'t hurt your feelings.      Fame is fickle, and I know it. It has it\'s compensations but it also has it\'s drawbacks, and I\'ve experienced them both.      My illusions didn\'t have anything to do with being a fine actress. I knew how third rate I was. I could actually feel my lack of talent, as if it were cheap clothes I was wearing inside. But my God, how I wanted to learn, to change, to improve!      If I play a stupid girl, and ask a stupid question, I\'ve got to follow it through. What am I supposed to do, look intelligent?      [on her famous nude calendar pose in 1949] My sin has been no more than I have written, posing for the nude because I desperately needed 50 dollars to get my car out of hock.      An actor is supposed to be a sensitive instrument. Isaac Stern takes good care of his violin. What if everyone jumped on his violin?      There was my name up in lights. I said, ""God, somebody\'s made a mistake!"" But there it was in lights. And I sat there and said, ""Remember, you\'re not a star"". Yet there it was up in lights.      Some people have been unkind. If I say I want to grow as an actress, they look at my figure. If I say I want to develop, to learn my craft, they laugh. Somehow they don\'t expect me to be serious about my work.      I was never used to being happy, so that wasn\'t something I ever took for granted. I did sort of think, you know, marriage did that. You see, I was brought up differently from the average American child because the average child is brought up expecting to be happy - that\'s it, successful, happy, and on time.      You know, when you grow up you can get kind of sour, I mean, that\'s the way it can go.      Wouldn\'t it be nice to be like men and get notches in your belt and sleep with most attractive men and not get emotionally involved?      I used to think as I looked at the Hollywood night, ""There must be thousands of girls sitting alone like me, dreaming of becoming a movie star. But I\'m not going to worry about them. I\'m dreaming the hardest.""      The trouble with censors is they worry if a girl has cleavage. They ought to worry if she hasn\'t any.      I used to say to myself, ""What the devil have you got to be proud about, Marilyn Monroe?"" And I\'d answer, ""Everything, everything"".      [on stardom] It scares me. All those people I don\'t know, sometimes they\'re so emotional. I mean, if they love you that much without knowing you, they can also hate you the same way.      [Johann Wolfgang von Goethe] said, ""Talent is developed in privacy"", you know? And it\'s really true. There is a need for aloneness which I don\'t think most people realize for an actor. It\'s almost having certain kinds of secrets for yourself that you\'ll let the whole world in on only for a moment, when you\'re acting.      I want to be an artist, an actress with integrity.      I\'ve never dropped anyone I believed in.      [on John F. Kennedy] It would be so nice to have a president who looks so young and good-looking.      I restore myself when I\'m alone. A career is born in public -- talent in private.      Talent is developed in privacy... but everybody is always tugging at you. They\'d all like sort of a chunk at you. They\'d kind of like to take pieces out of you.      I want to be an artist... not an erotic freak. I don\'t want to be sold to the public as a celluloid aphrodisiacal.      [about Montgomery Clift] He\'s the only person I know that is in worse shape than I am.      I\'ve never liked the name Marilyn. I\'ve often wished that I had held out that day for Jean Monroe. But I guess it\'s too late to do anything about it now.      [on Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift] Marlon\'s kinda hard to tie down, they say. He\'s never sure what he wants to do. He and Monty Clift have a lot in common, though they\'re totally different people, but they don\'t plan their careers too well and they\'re not ambitious enough for their talents.      Personally, I react to Marlon Brando. He\'s a favorite of mine.      [on Frank Sinatra] He is a man at the top of his profession and is a fine actor as well. You know, he got an Oscar for From Here to Eternity (1953). He has helped more people anonymously than anybody else. And the miserable press smears him with lies about his being involved with the Mafia and gangsters. And Frank just takes it.      [on Mae West] A nice lady even though she turned down making a picture with me. That just shows how smart she is.      Speaking of Oscars, I would win overwhelmingly if the Academy gave an Oscar for faking orgasms. I have done some of my best acting convincing my partners I was in the throes of ecstasy.      [on Laurence Olivier on the set of The Prince and the Showgirl (1957)] Olivier came into my dressing room to give me hell for screwing up. I soothed him by telling him I thought his Hamlet (1948) was one of the greatest films ever made. You know he won an Oscar for it.      When Clark Gable died, I cried for 2 days straight. I couldn\'t eat or sleep.      [on Sigmund Freud] I read his ""Introductory Lectures,"" God, what a genius. He makes it so understandable. And he is so right. Didn\'t he say himself that [William Shakespeare] and [Fyodor Dostoevsky] had a better understanding of psychology than all the scientists put together? Damn it, they do.      [on James Joyce and the character of Molly Bloom in Ulysses] Here is Joyce writing what a woman thinks to herself. Can he, does he really know her innermost thoughts? But after I read the whole book, I could better understand that Joyce is an artist who could penetrate the souls of people, male or female. It really doesn\'t matter that Joyce doesn\'t have...or never felt a menstrual cramp. To me Leopold Bloom is a central character. He is the despised Irish Jew, married to an Irish Catholic woman. It is through them Joyce develops much of what he wants to say. Do you agree that the scene where Bloom is looking at the little girl on the swing is the most erotic in the book?      [on John F. Kennedy] When he has finished his achievements, he will take his place with Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and [Franklin D. Roosevelt] as one of our greatest Presidents. I\'m glad he has [Robert F. Kennedy]. It\'s like the Navy. The President is the Captain and Bobby is his Executive Officer. Bobby would do absolutely anything for his brother. And so would I. I\'ll never embarrass him. As long as I have memory, I have John Fitzgerald Kennedy.      [on Sunday being the loneliest day of the week for her] All the men I know are spending the day with their wives and families, and all the stores in Los Angeles are closed. You can\'t wander through looking at all the pretty clothes and pretending to buy something.      [on Marlon Brando] He\'s very sweet and tender, not at all the Stanley Kowalski rapist people think he is.Arthur Miller wouldn\'t have married me if I had been nothing but a dumb blonde.      I have always been deeply terrified to really be someone\'s wife since I know from life one cannot love another, ever, really.      [on Peter Lawford] I have a need to be frightened and nothing really in my personal relationships and dealings lately have been frightening me, except for him. I felt very uneasy at different times with him, the real reason I was afraid of him is because I believe him to be homosexual...Peter wants to be a woman and would like to be me, I think.      Hollywood is a place where they\'ll pay you $50,000 for a kiss and 50c for your soul.      It\'s better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone.      It was the creative part that kept me going, trying to be an actress. I enjoy acting when you really hit it right.      I did what they said and all it got me was a lot of abuse. Everyone\'s just laughing at me. I hate it. Big breasts, big ass, big deal.      [on Arthur Miller\'s script for \'The Misfits\'] Arthur did this to me. He could have written anything and he comes up with this. If that\'s what he thinks of me, well, then I\'m not for him and he\'s not for me. Arthur says it\'s his movie. I don\'t think he even wants me in it.      I won\'t be satisfied until people want to hear me sing without looking at me.      The body is meant to be seen, not all covered up.      I love to do things that censors won\'t pass.      I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they\'re right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.      I have feelings too. I am still human. All I want is to be loved, for myself and for my talent.      I knew I belonged to the public and to the world, not because I was talented or even beautiful, but because I had never belonged to anything or anyone else.      Boys think girls are like books, If the cover doesn\'t catch their eye they won\'t bother to read what\'s inside.      [on shooting the famous scene in The Seven Year Itch (1955) where wind from the subway beneath blows her skirt up] At first it was all innocent and fun, but when Billy Wilder kept shooting the scene over and over the crowd of men kept on applauding and shouting, \'More, more Marilyn - let\'s see more.\' What was supposed to be a fun scene turned into a sex scene.      I\'ve often stood silent at a party for hours listening to my movie idols turn into dull and little people.      When you\'re young and healthy you can plan on Monday to commit suicide, and by Wednesday you\'re laughing again.      Suicide is a person\'s privilege. I don\'t believe it\'s a sin or a crime, it\'s your right if you do. Though it doesn\'t get you anywhere.      The other girls rode to school in a bus. I had no nickel to pay for the ride. Rain or shine, I walked the two miles from my ""aunt\'s"" home to the school. I hated the walk, I hated the school. I had no friends. The pupils seldom talked to me and never wanted me in their games. Nobody ever walked home with me or invited me to visit their homes. This was partly because I came from the poor part of the district where all the Mexicans and Japanese lived. It was also because I couldn\'t smile at anyone.      How or why I can act - and I\'m not sure I can - is the thing for me to understand. The torture, let alone the day to day happenings - the pain one cannot explain to another.      Executives can get colds and stay home and phone in - but the actor? How dare you get a cold or a virus! I wish they had to act a comedy with a temperature and a virus infection! I\'m there to give a performance, not to be disciplined by a studio. This isn\'t supposed to be a military school, after all.      [on homosexuality] No sex is wrong if there\'s love involved.      As long as I can remember, I\'ve always loved people.      What the world really needs is a real feeling of kinship. Everybody: stars, laborers, Negroes, Jews, Arabs. We are all brothers. Please don\'t make me a joke. End the interview with what I believe.      People always ask me if I believe diamonds are a girl\'s best friend. Frankly, I don\'t.      I have favorite motion-picture stars, like everyone else. You know who mine are? My favorite is Marlon Brando. I mean, really, I believe we\'d be an interesting combination. I\'ve said that about Marlon for a long time, but we haven\'t found the right story. Can you imagine us on the big screen? I hope something happens soon. Greta Garbo, I\'ve never met her. It really bugs me when I miss one of her films on TV. Oh, if you could only get me to meet her! I\'ve also heard wonderful things about Jeanne Eagels and Laurette Taylor. And the one they called the Blond Bombshell: Jean Harlow. Kay Kendall was a great comedian. She was really talented. I would have loved working with Gerard Philipe, the handsome French star- his films I\'ve been told were a huge success in France, as were his stage plays. I was told he wanted to make films with me. Oh, what a shame we never got the opportunity. We would have made an interesting team. What a shame. He was so young to die; he was thirty-six. He had been ill and apparently died of a heart attack.      Nearly everyone I knew talked to me about God. They always warned me not to offend Him.      Drugs pull you down and shut the lid on life. Pot opens everything up. All the anxieties, the creepy crawly blues, it all just drifts away and you can slowly remember what it feels like to be alive. Even more importantly, you can take a step back from the crap that\'s flying and see what really is important, which of the many things in your life really deserves worrying about. Not much!      [why she converted to Judaism] I believe in everything a little, and if I have kids, I think they should be Jewish. Anyway, I can identify with the Jews. Everybody\'s out to get them no matter what they do.      It might be kind of a relief to be finished. It\'s sort of like you don\'t know what kind of a yard dash you\'re running, but then you\'re at the finish line and you sort of sigh - you\'ve made it! But you never have. You have to start all over again.      I think that sexuality is only attractive when it\'s natural and spontaneous.      I sleep in the nude but I pull the sheets up.      When it comes down to it, I let them think what they want. If they care enough to bother with what I do, then I\'m already better than them.      I remember when I got the part in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Jane Russell, she was the brunette in it and I was the blonde. She got $200,000 for it, and I got my $500 a week, but that to me was, you know, considerable. She, by the way, was quite wonderful to me. The only thing was I couldn\'t get a dressing room. I said, finally, I really got to this kind of level, I said, ""Look, after all, I am the blonde, and it is Gentlemen Prefer Blondes!"" Because still they always kept saying, ""Remember, you\'re not a star."" I said, ""Well, whatever I am, I am the blonde!""      Who said nights were for sleep?      We are all born sexual creatures, thank God, but it\'s a pity so many people despise and crush this natural gift.      I\'m for the individual as opposed to the corporation. The way it is the individual is the underdog, and with all the things a corporation has going for them the individual comes out banged on her head. The artist is nothing. It\'s really tragic.      People had a habit of looking at me like I was some kind of mirror instead of a person. They didn\'t see me, they saw their own lewd thoughts, then they white-masked themselves by calling me the lewd one.      For the first family I lived with, to go to a movie was a sin. Every night I was told to pray that I would not wake up in hell.      There is nothing positive about being fat. And there is nothing positive about loving yourself. We all need to conform to society\'s expectations of who we are and if we don\'t, who will? Life is more enjoyable when you are thin and pretty. I was never fat a day in my life and I never will.      Creativity has got to start with humanity and when you\'re a human being, you feel, you suffer.      Fame is like caviar. It\'s good to have caviar, but not every damned day!      Let yourself go, the pleasure of physical movement is so important. If that\'s a problem, you say to yourself, what is there that I am afraid of, or hiding? Maybe your libido!      I have always felt comfortable in blue jeans. I have found it interesting, however, that people also whistle at blue jeans. I have to admit that I like mine to fit. There\'s nothing I hate worse than baggy blue jeans.      I want the world to see my body.      Men who think that a woman\'s past love affairs lessen her love for them are stupid. A woman can bring a new love to each man that she loves, providing that there are not too many.      The public doesn\'t mind people living together without being married, providing they don\'t overdo it.      Imperfection is beauty, madness is genius, it\'s better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring.

Singer, best known for his performance of jazz hit ""Autumn Leaves"" among other popular songs.      The name of ""Yves Montand"" comes from his childhood: his Italian mother used to yell at him ""Ivo, monta"" (""come upstairs, Ivo"" in Tuscan dialect) when it was time to go home.      Dated famous French singer Édith Piaf from 1944 to 1946.      When he was young, he was a hairdresser in Marseille (France).      Stepfather of Catherine Allégret from his marriage to Simone Signoret. His only biological child, son Valentin Montand, was by his girlfriend Carole Amiel.      Has his look-alike puppet in the French show _""Guignols de l\'info, Les"" (1988)_.      President of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 1987      His parents escaped Italy in 1921 as Benito Mussolini rose to power.      Montand\'s father, Giovanni Livi, was a locally important figure in the French Communist Party in Marseilles when Montand was in his teens. Montand himself later joined the Communist Party and remained a member until 1968, when he broke with the Party in response to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.      Admired Fred Astaire.      He is interred near his wife Simone Signoret in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.      Became natural citizen of France in 1932.      Toured as a jazz singer in the Soviet Union in 1956 and in 1963, and met with Nikita Khrushchev. Became critical of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, then made a movie about socialist dictatorship.Anne Fleurange accused him of being the father of her daughter, who she said was conceived while she and Montand were working on Vincent, François, Paul... et les autres (1974). She sued him to obtain a DNA sample, but he refused. After his death, Fleurange obtained a court ruling to have his body exhumed. On 11 March 1998, a paternity test proved that Montand wasn\'t the father of her daughter.      In her book ""My Lucky Stars"", Shirley MacLaine wrote that before filming on My Geisha (1962) began, Montand bet her husband Steve Parker that he could seduce her. Parker, whom MacLaine learned later, was having an affair at the time, took Montand up on the bet; Montand won.      Came from a working-class (docklands) Marseilles family. Left school at eleven and held various jobs in bars, factories and a hair salon. He first performed in amateur theatrics at the age of seventeen. His breakthrough came in his twenties, while singing in Parisian music halls. There he was spotted by Edith Piaf. He lived with her for two years. She became his mentor and co-star in several films, until his first solo success in ""Le Salaire de la Peur"" in 1953.      Became the first popular singer to perform at the Metropolitan Opera House, in 1982.      First singing tour of the United States in 1959.      Had a well-publicised affair with Marilyn Monroe in 1960, while filming Let\'s Make Love (1960).      In October 1947, Henri Betti offered to Yves Montand singing two songs he has composed : ""Mais qu\'est-ce que j\'ai ?"" (lyrics by Édith Piaf) and ""C\'est si bon"" (lyrics by André Hornez). Yves Montand recorded ""Mais qu\'est-ce que j\'ai ?"" with Jean Marion and his Orchestra but not ""C\'est si bon"". After the success of the recording of ""C\'est si bon"" by Les Soeurs Étienne with Raymond Legrand and his Orchestra, he decided to record it. He recorded the song on 11 May 1948.      In 2016, Lambert Wilson released the album ""Wilson chante Montand"" in which he sings the songs of Yves Montand. The musical arrangements of the 17 songs on the album were made by Bruno Fontaine. Among the 17 tracks there is ""Mais qu\'est-ce que j\'ai ?"" composed by Henri Betti with the lyrics of Édith Piaf in 1947.      In the late 1940s, he recorded the four greatest hits composed by Henri Betti : ""Mais qu\'est-ce que j\'ai ?"" (lyrics by Édith Piaf) in 1947, ""C\'est si bon"" (lyrics by André Hornez), ""Rien dans les Mains, rien dans les Poches"" (lyrics by André Hornez) and ""Maître Pierre"" (lyrics by Jacques Plante) in 1948.      Marlène Jobert tells in her biography that Yves Montand once tried to seduce her; and because she refused he tried several times to smash her career. Jobert also said that while she had great admiration for the artist, Yves Montand was some one arrogant, selfish and a disgusting character in his personal life.      Marlène Jobert tells in her biography that just after the news about Marilyn Monroe\'s death, Yves Montand - ex Marilyn\'s lover - remained stone cold whilst the rest of the French people around him were crying, full of grief.      Marlène Jobert tells in her biography that when she was invited by the couple Yves Montand - Simone Signoret - Montand humiliated Signoret just in front of their guest.

Unlike many others who have left comments about this film, I really
enjoy it.  This is definitely not high on the intellect scale, but it is a
sweet romantic comedy.
I agree this is not Marilyn's best film, but her performance in the
role is better than anyone else could have done it; very cute and
believable.  Some of the writing really seems to target Marilyn's
own personal life (I don't know if they did that on purpose),
especially when she talks about going to night school.  Also during
the song ""Incurably Romantic,"" Marilyn's dress is flying up (a
parallel to ""The Seven-Year Itch?"").  Her performance of the song
""My Heart Belongs to Daddy"" is just great.  It's really a lot of
fun.
The cameos are awesome, they really make the film into a ""time
capsule"" of the most popular comedian, dancer, and singer of the
time.  Tony Randall has a nice supporting role throughout the film;
he is great in the scene where he sees Jean-Marc Clement's
""softer side.""
Yves Montand and Marilyn Monroe have the strangest relationship
in the movie, and you have to feel bad for Jean-Marc!  He is not
used to NOT getting the girl!  Yves plays this very well, I think.  They
may lack some chemistry, but the two characters are cute and
likable and you really want them to get together.  
So what I'm saying is, this is well worth seeing, especially if you
are a fan of Marilyn or Yves, just don't expect it to be intellectually
challenging... it is a great rainy day flick. :-)

This is one of my favorite Marilyn films.  No, let me amend that--this is
one of my favorite Marilyn performances.  She is sweet, natural,
sympathetic, adorable. She has no character to play and no script and no
director (Cukor was sliding fast at this  point)  But she and Montand are
lovely together; two great charmers surrounded by an overblown 60's
confection of ""guest stars"" and constant costume changes (although some
of
Marilyn's outfits  are so flimsy one wonders  why they bothered to dress
her
at all?!)  ""My Heart Belongs To Daddy"" is classic MM, but I have a
perverse
fondness for ""Specialization"" with Monroe hopping around (she  really
couldn't dance) in this INCREDIBLE gown, belly and backside bulging, a
Reubens come to  life.
It's a very minor film, especially sandwiched between ""Some Like  It
Hot""
and ""The Misfits""  but there is pleasure to be found if you're into Miss
M.

Released in 1960 after Marilyn's super turn in the fantastic 'Some Like
It Hot', LML has often been cited as Monroe's worst movie.<br><br>There is plenty to work against the film: Cukor's almost non-existent
direction, the rather dreadful musical numbers, Yves Montand's
irritating performance and the wasted opportunities of the star cameos.<br><br>However, Let's Make Love is a reasonably inoffensive way to waste an
afternoon. The plot is slight and therefore doesn't require too much
brain power to follow and Monroe is, as usual, cinema gold. Despite the
fact that she is slightly overweight here and nothing much has been

This is by no means a great film, but I was pleasantly surprised in the end.
 Montand and Monroe both do good jobs.  Tony Randall is always enjoyable,
and Milton Berle has a great time teaching Montand how to be funny, the best
comic moment of the film.  Having just seen Montand in The Wages of Fear,
one of the most intense movies ever made, it was interesting to see him
goofing off and having a good time.  This role takes him back to some of the
songs he sang early in his career, not long after Edith Piaf discovered him.
 I only wish he had been able to sing more in the movie.  I'm not a big fan
of Monroe - her dumb-blonde routine generally irritates me - but she seems
more vulnerable in this film, more pleasant to watch.  She particularly
impressed me in the musical numbers.  Unfortunately, the costume designer
did a lousy job - everything seems too big on her, or just tacky.  Compare
these costumes to those of Bardot in Une Parisenne, made around the same
time period.  There are ways and then there are ways to show off a body like
that of Bardot or Monroe.  All in all, this is a light piece of fluff, with
some humorous moments, some sappy moments, some good musical numbers, some
bad writing, some good cameos by Berle, Bing, and Gene Kelly, a silly
storyline, Yves Montand, Monroe, and a good dose of fun.

Since I am watching all Marilyn's movies, ''Let's Make Love'' was the
second one from the collection to be watched. Marilyn is beautiful as
usual, and we have Cameos from Gene Kelly,Bing Crosby and Milton Berle
as themselves.<br><br>The movie starts telling the story of Jean Marc's ancestors, and how
his family started to become richer with the time, until his present
days as a billionaire. Jean Marc has power,money and also is a
'Casanova', with a new woman to go out everyday. One day, he discovers
that he is going to be satirized in an off-Broadway theater, and he
goes to see how the play is going to be, until he sees Amanda singing
and dancing in a provocative way and the director,who thinks that Jean
Marc is an actor trying to take the role of himself,cast him as a
member of the show. Decided to go out with Amanda and make her fall for
him, he pretends to be someone else,using the identity of Alexander
Dumas and acting as a poor actor who wants new lessons from Amanda to
improve his acting career. With the time, Jean Marc starts to fall for
Amanda, since she is the only woman who was kind to him without
expecting money or gifts in return. The problem now is his fake
identity.<br><br>PS: I only have to complain about the ending of this movie, which, in
my opinion, was far from good: I don't think that Amanda should stay
with Jean-Marc, since she always refused and hated rich guys like him,
calling him arrogant and liar,among other things. I think she changed
her idea too quickly about him,after knowing Alexander Dumas' original
identity was Jean Marc, but anyway, no movie is perfect.<br><br>aka ""Adorável Pecadora"" - Brazil

Without what we know about her now, this movie wouldn't be worth the time it
took to watch it.  However, now we know about what was going on while the
movie was being shot, you can see the attraction between her and Msieu
Montand, whose wife took him back afterwards.  It's funny, since I've seen
him in a French movie, where HIS wife was unfaithful and how he copes with
that.  What goes around comes around, I suppose.<br><br>Montand has to act silly, which must have been as painful for him as it was
for his character, a multi-billionaire trying to win Miss Musical Star,
Marilyn.  Watching the male singer in this movie was funny, as it reminds
you of the 40s and the Dean Martin style crooners.  Watching Bing Crosby and
Milton Berl teach Yves how to sing and be funny was a hoot!!!  ""Don't
'bubba-boo-boo', or you'll get arrested,"" Bing suggests.
Watching Milton berl walk on his ankles wasn't all that funny, but this was
the 60s after all.<br><br>I liked the musical numbers, and watching Yves' face do all its rubbery
wrinkling numbers.  He may have been a great actor because he could put on
so many different expressions, but his best movie was the one where he's
trying to run for office in a crooked Banana Republic (sorta like our
present government), a Cost-Grava film. <br><br> See this one just to remind you of how beautiful, how vulnerable, Marilyn

MM and to be fair Monroes first appearance singing ""My heart belongs to

she is on fire in this 3 minute masterpiece. I love the kiss and wink

I was pretty unimpressed with this movie, to be frank. There was
something about every aspect of it that didn't quite add up and you're
left with an essentially dull film, which you're not really too
concerned about by the end. I am a huge fan of Marilyn but I don't feel
she was at all her best in this picture, and I don't think that's
entirely her fault - the film around her is incredibly flimsy. The
dialogue is often wooden and unconvincing, and Montand's character and
his storyline are just totally unbelievable - nothing of what he says
or what he does was convincing to me and this really brought the film
down very hard and very quickly. The musical numbers are pretty
standard fair and were nothing Marilyn hadn't done before. The film
didn't make me laugh and I didn't care what happened to the characters.
If anything I was only sad the talented Marilyn Monroe was a part of
the film - as her portfolio shows she was deserving of far higher
quality films than this. I can't recommend the film as it's not really
worth your time and you probably won't enjoy it - if you just want to
see all of Monroe's film's than see it, but otherwise don't bother.

There is a singular Marilyn moment which defines her timeless relevance
and popularity in American history. Before experiencing Marilyn on
screen, I often encountered her photos/ references about her in
magazines, encyclopedia, compilation and archives. I also read a Life
in Pictures biography about her. How I visualized her gait, her voice
and her gestures were quite contrary to her actual performance in
cinemas. I expected this woman to possess extraordinary acting
capabilities along with natural stage charm and sex-appeal and a
deeper, mellower voice that showed class and refinement. Never did I
think Marilyn to be so bubbly, fluffy, and erratic with a chirpy,
girlish timbre- the typical coquette whom men would swoon over to in an
instant. She wasn't like Greta Garbo; the magic couldn't be discovered
immediately in Monroe (Garbo could make everyone around her, the
actors, the cameras and the audience, fall in love with her in an
instant). The disappointment in me after enduring Prince and the
Showgirl and Bus Stop cast a negative perception about Monroe. I found
her syrupy and panicky, as though she is constantly thinking of ways to
keep her audiences (her male fans) happy while not giving up the
unpredictable method acting. I preferred 7 year itch  Marilyn didn't
experiment but only let her naive face, clueless eyes, admirable figure
and the witty dialogs do the work. Sometimes, I felt the method acting
ruined her performances, though she has a few shiny moments on her last
released film 'The Misfits'. After four films, the true reason for her
massive success still eluded me, but in Let's Make Love (a lackluster
film overall) I realized why she was adored.<br><br>It was the scene where her character Amanda Dell, a small-time actress
and a stage performer, began jogging on the footpath and encouraged
Jean-Marc Clement (played somewhat sullenly by Yves Montand) to join
her. An embarrassed Clement looks around as men seem to ogle Amanda;
she isn't dressed inappropriately, but she smiles and her face is
beaming. Marilyn seemed to draw everyone's attention not by acting
stupendously or exposing her body here- she was carefree and spirited,
probably aware that men were eying her but not minding. She knew she
was a siren, but she also made it clear that she wasn't a bimbo. She
has this coy charm about her, a sense of self-awareness that makes her
so amicable with men and women. It is similar to what Meryl Streep said
in a speech ' to be appealing to boys and being accepted by girls a
tricky situation (which she mastered). Marilyn doesn't explicitly try
to draw attention; she does it cleverly, discreetly.<br><br>Unfortunately, she was stuck with a patchy script that was deficient in
several aspects. A Paul Thomas Anderson start (Magnolia style) which
montages the fate of six/seven Jean Marc Clement is middlingly amusing
but unnecessary because there isn't any reference to it later. I did
get what it was supposed to mean but there need not be narrations of so
many Clements. Then the camera lingers on a group of elite gentlemen
smoking cigars as a debonair Jean Marc of Modern Times tells them a
joke. These men may have heard it several times, but they flatteringly
laugh at his inane joke  he is a billionaire, keep in mind. Some
scenes later, when he pretends to be a nascent actor and impersonator,
Jean Marc reiterates the same joke to a bunch of actors and is given a
damp response. The billionaire, with a keen esthetic interest and a
notorious womanizing reputation, is informed that he is going to be
satirized in an off-Broadway Revue. He does not react at first but then
shows displeasure in such an idea- therefore he checks out a rehearsal
of the performance. This seems far-fetched as the theater itself seems
so unremarkable and lowly with bawdy, unfunny and tired acts that no
one but a local goon would take objection of being satirized. We
instead get this wealthy man treading such common places.<br><br>There Jean is struck by the glamorous Amanda Dell, who is tailed by
hungry boys in an unimpressive number that lacks naughtiness. Marilyn's
voice sounds affected, and she fails to bring the oomph. There are a
couple of well acted scenes after this between Montand and Monroe where
the former seems shy and out-of-place in the theater while the latter
can adapt to any surrounding. The third person in the love triangle is
Frankie Vaughan, who shares a better chemistry with Marilyn. Montand
takes his initial defeats too seriously and seems so dull at times that
it is impossible to feel sorry for him or consider Marilyn the right
lady for him. She seems like a good friend and adviser, not a lover in
any way, till the end of the story. Here is where more than Montand,
the script fails in providing more crucial scenes between Montand and
Monroe. 'Let's Make Love' isn't something the movie sets out to make-
it is rather 'let me buy your love', which is crude. Also, in a
desperate bid to raise laughs, Milton Berle, Bing Crosby and Gene Kelly
were roped in and I was thinking, ""If Gene were younger he would've
made a charming Jean Clement"". Berle is funny but has to feign laughter
at Jean Clements's drab performance on stage, for which he should've
demanded for additional fees.<br><br>The musicals are ghastly, the production is weak and the plot is
sketchy; only the performances try to save 'Let's Make Love's' face. I
would say the best actor in the movie would be Wilfred Hyde White, who
mouths the line ""You made a terrible/risky decision by mortgaging your
house for this (to save his theater)"" to the theater owner. I would add
that George Cukor made a terrible decision of getting big actors such
as Monroe and choosing such a script for them"".<br><br>My Rating: 3.4 out of 10

Unlike many others who have left comments about this film, I really
enjoy it.  This is definitely not high on the intellect scale, but it is a
sweet romantic comedy.
I agree this is not Marilyn's best film, but her performance in the
role is better than anyone else could have done it; very cute and
believable.  Some of the writing really seems to target Marilyn's
own personal life (I don't know if they did that on purpose),
especially when she talks about going to night school.  Also during
the song ""Incurably Romantic,"" Marilyn's dress is flying up (a
parallel to ""The Seven-Year Itch?"").  Her performance of the song
""My Heart Belongs to Daddy"" is just great.  It's really a lot of
fun.
The cameos are awesome, they really make the film into a ""time
capsule"" of the most popular comedian, dancer, and singer of the
time.  Tony Randall has a nice supporting role throughout the film;
he is great in the scene where he sees Jean-Marc Clement's
""softer side.""
Yves Montand and Marilyn Monroe have the strangest relationship
in the movie, and you have to feel bad for Jean-Marc!  He is not
used to NOT getting the girl!  Yves plays this very well, I think.  They
may lack some chemistry, but the two characters are cute and
likable and you really want them to get together.  
So what I'm saying is, this is well worth seeing, especially if you
are a fan of Marilyn or Yves, just don't expect it to be intellectually
challenging... it is a great rainy day flick. :-)

This is one of my favorite Marilyn films.  No, let me amend that--this is
one of my favorite Marilyn performances.  She is sweet, natural,
sympathetic, adorable. She has no character to play and no script and no
director (Cukor was sliding fast at this  point)  But she and Montand are
lovely together; two great charmers surrounded by an overblown 60's
confection of ""guest stars"" and constant costume changes (although some
of
Marilyn's outfits  are so flimsy one wonders  why they bothered to dress
her
at all?!)  ""My Heart Belongs To Daddy"" is classic MM, but I have a
perverse
fondness for ""Specialization"" with Monroe hopping around (she  really
couldn't dance) in this INCREDIBLE gown, belly and backside bulging, a
Reubens come to  life.
It's a very minor film, especially sandwiched between ""Some Like  It
Hot""
and ""The Misfits""  but there is pleasure to be found if you're into Miss
M.

Released in 1960 after Marilyn's super turn in the fantastic 'Some Like
It Hot', LML has often been cited as Monroe's worst movie.<br><br>There is plenty to work against the film: Cukor's almost non-existent
direction, the rather dreadful musical numbers, Yves Montand's
irritating performance and the wasted opportunities of the star cameos.<br><br>However, Let's Make Love is a reasonably inoffensive way to waste an
afternoon. The plot is slight and therefore doesn't require too much
brain power to follow and Monroe is, as usual, cinema gold. Despite the
fact that she is slightly overweight here and nothing much has been
done with her in terms of make-up, hair or wardrobe she is eminently
watchable. She gives a convincing, assured performance in her role

girlish timbre- the typical coquette whom men would swoon over to in an
instant. She wasn't like Greta Garbo; the magic couldn't be discovered
immediately in Monroe (Garbo could make everyone around her, the
actors, the cameras and the audience, fall in love with her in an
instant). The disappointment in me after enduring Prince and the
Showgirl and Bus Stop cast a negative perception about Monroe. I found
her syrupy and panicky, as though she is constantly thinking of ways to
keep her audiences (her male fans) happy while not giving up the
unpredictable method acting. I preferred 7 year itch  Marilyn didn't
experiment but only let her naive face, clueless eyes, admirable figure
and the witty dialogs do the work. Sometimes, I felt the method acting
ruined her performances, though she has a few shiny moments on her last
released film 'The Misfits'. After four films, the true reason for her
massive success still eluded me, but in Let's Make Love (a lackluster
film overall) I realized why she was adored.<br><br>It was the scene where her character Amanda Dell, a small-time actress
and a stage performer, began jogging on the footpath and encouraged
Jean-Marc Clement (played somewhat sullenly by Yves Montand) to join
her. An embarrassed Clement looks around as men seem to ogle Amanda;
she isn't dressed inappropriately, but she smiles and her face is
beaming. Marilyn seemed to draw everyone's attention not by acting
stupendously or exposing her body here- she was carefree and spirited,
probably aware that men were eying her but not minding. She knew she
was a siren, but she also made it clear that she wasn't a bimbo. She
has this coy charm about her, a sense of self-awareness that makes her
so amicable with men and women. It is similar to what Meryl Streep said
in a speech ' to be appealing to boys and being accepted by girls a
tricky situation (which she mastered). Marilyn doesn't explicitly try
to draw attention; she does it cleverly, discreetly.<br><br>Unfortunately, she was stuck with a patchy script that was deficient in
several aspects. A Paul Thomas Anderson start (Magnolia style) which
montages the fate of six/seven Jean Marc Clement is middlingly amusing
but unnecessary because there isn't any reference to it later. I did
get what it was supposed to mean but there need not be narrations of so
many Clements. Then the camera lingers on a group of elite gentlemen
smoking cigars as a debonair Jean Marc of Modern Times tells them a
joke. These men may have heard it several times, but they flatteringly
laugh at his inane joke  he is a billionaire, keep in mind. Some
scenes later, when he pretends to be a nascent actor and impersonator,
Jean Marc reiterates the same joke to a bunch of actors and is given a
damp response. The billionaire, with a keen esthetic interest and a
notorious womanizing reputation, is informed that he is going to be
satirized in an off-Broadway Revue. He does not react at first but then
shows displeasure in such an idea- therefore he checks out a rehearsal
of the performance. This seems far-fetched as the theater itself seems
so unremarkable and lowly with bawdy, unfunny and tired acts that no
one but a local goon would take objection of being satirized. We
instead get this wealthy man treading such common places.<br><br>There Jean is struck by the glamorous Amanda Dell, who is tailed by
hungry boys in an unimpressive number that lacks naughtiness. Marilyn's
voice sounds affected, and she fails to bring the oomph. There are a
couple of well acted scenes after this between Montand and Monroe where
the former seems shy and out-of-place in the theater while the latter
can adapt to any surrounding. The third person in the love triangle is
Frankie Vaughan, who shares a better chemistry with Marilyn. Montand
takes his initial defeats too seriously and seems so dull at times that
it is impossible to feel sorry for him or consider Marilyn the right
lady for him. She seems like a good friend and adviser, not a lover in
any way, till the end of the story. Here is where more than Montand,
the script fails in providing more crucial scenes between Montand and
Monroe. 'Let's Make Love' isn't something the movie sets out to make-
it is rather 'let me buy your love', which is crude. Also, in a
desperate bid to raise laughs, Milton Berle, Bing Crosby and Gene Kelly
were roped in and I was thinking, ""If Gene were younger he would've
made a charming Jean Clement"". Berle is funny but has to feign laughter
at Jean Clements's drab performance on stage, for which he should've
demanded for additional fees.<br><br>The musicals are ghastly, the production is weak and the plot is
sketchy; only the performances try to save 'Let's Make Love's' face. I
would say the best actor in the movie would be Wilfred Hyde White, who
mouths the line ""You made a terrible/risky decision by mortgaging your
house for this (to save his theater)"" to the theater owner. I would add
that George Cukor made a terrible decision of getting big actors such
as Monroe and choosing such a script for them"".<br><br>My Rating: 3.4 out of 10

His early years in Bristol would have been an ordinary lower-middle-class childhood, except for one extraordinary event. At age nine, he came home from school one day and was told his mother had gone off to a seaside resort. However, the real truth was that she had been placed in a mental institution, where she would remain for years, and he was never told about it (he would not see his mother again until he was in his late 20s).He left school at age 14, lying about his age and forging his father\'s signature on a letter to join Bob Pender\'s troupe of knockabout comedians. He learned pantomime as well as acrobatics as he toured with the Pender troupe in the English provinces, picked up a Cockney accent in the music halls in London, and then in July 1920, was one of the eight Pender boys selected to go to the United States. Their show on Broadway, ""Good Times"", ran for 456 performances, giving Grant time to acclimatize. He would stay in America. Mae West wanted Grant for She Done Him Wrong (1933) because she saw his combination of virility, sexuality and the aura and bearing of a gentleman. Grant was young enough to begin the new career of fatherhood when he stopped making movies at age 62.One biographer said Grant was alienated by the new realism in the film industry. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he had invented a man-of-the-world persona and a style - ""high comedy with polished words"". In To Catch a Thief (1955), he and Grace Kelly were allowed to improvise some of the dialogue. They knew what the director, Alfred Hitchcock, wanted to do with a scene, they rehearsed it, put in some clever double entendres that got past the censors, and then the scene was filmed. His biggest box-office success was another Hitchcock 1950s film, North by Northwest (1959) made with Eva Marie Saint since Kelly was by that time Princess of Monaco.Although Grant retired from the screen, he remained active. He accepted a position on the board of directors at Faberge. By all accounts this position was not honorary, as some had assumed. Grant regularly attended meetings and traveled internationally to support them. The position also permitted use of a private plane, which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother Dyan Cannon, was working. He later joined the boards of Hollywood Park, the Academy of Magical Arts (The Magic Castle - Hollywood, California), Western Airlines (acquired by Delta Airlines in 1987) and MGM.Grant expressed no interest in making a career comeback. He was in good health until almost the end of his life, when he suffered a mild stroke in October 1984. In his last years, he undertook tours of the United States in a one-man-show, ""A Conversation with Cary Grant"", in which he would show clips from his films and answer audience questions. On November 29, 1986, Cary Grant died at age 82 of a cerebral hemorrhage in Davenport, Iowa.In 1999, the American Film Institute named Grant the second male star of Golden Age of Hollywood cinema (after Humphrey Bogart). Grant was known for comedic and dramatic roles; his best-known films include Bringing Up Baby (1938), The Philadelphia Story (1940), His Girl Friday (1940), Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), Notorious (1946), An Affair to Remember (1957), North by Northwest (1959) and Charade (1963).- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Dale O\'Connor <daleoc@worldnet.att.net>          Spouse (5) Barbara Harris (11 April\xa01981            - 29 November\xa01986)\xa0(his death)           Dyan Cannon (22 July\xa01965            - 21 March\xa01968)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)           Betsy Drake (25 December\xa01949            - 13 August\xa01962)\xa0(divorced)           Barbara Hutton (8 July\xa01942            - 30 August\xa01945)\xa0(divorced)           Virginia Cherrill (9 February\xa01934            - 26 March\xa01935)\xa0(divorced)          Trade Mark (5)        Mid-Atlantic accent        Often played a handsome bachelor        Roles in romantic comedies        Chin dimple        Often played characters who were much younger than his actual age.Trivia (137)      Ranked #7 in Empire (UK) magazine\'s ""The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time"" list. [October 1997]      Became a father for the first time at age of 62 when his fourth wife Dyan Cannon gave birth to their daughter Jennifer Diane Grant (aka Jennifer Grant) on February 26, 1966.Ian Fleming modeled the James Bond character partially with Grant in mind.      Suffered a major stroke prior to performing in his one-man show ""An Evening with Cary Grant"" at the Adler Theater in Davenport, Iowa on November 29, 1986. Passed away later that night at St. Luke\'s Hospital at 11:22 p.m.      From 1932-1944, he shared a house with Randolph Scott, whom he met on Hot Saturday (1932). Scott often jokingly referred to Grant as his spouse. The 1940 census report shows Scott as head of household and Grant as his partner. Many studio heads threatened not to employ them together, unless they lived separately. Grant\'s marriage to Barbara Hutton permanently dissolved his living arrangement with Scott.      Cary Grant passed away on November 29, 1986, almost two months away from what would have been his 83rd birthday on January 18, 1987.      He gave his entire fee for The Philadelphia Story (1940) to the British war effort.      He once phoned hotel mogul Conrad Hilton in Istanbul, Turkey, to find out why his breakfast order at the Plaza Hotel, which called for muffins, came with only 1-1/2 English muffins instead of two. When Grant insisted that the explanation (a hotel efficiency report had found that most people ate only three of the four halves brought to them) still resulted in being cheated out of a half, the Plaza Hotel changed its policy and began serving two complete muffins with breakfast. From then on, Grant often spoke of forming an English Muffin-Lovers Society, members of which would be required to report any hotel or restaurant that listed muffins on the menu and then served fewer than two.      Turned down the role of James Bond in Dr. No (1962), believing himself to be too old at age 58 to play the hero. The role went to Sean Connery instead.      Chosen by Empire magazine as one of the 100 Sexiest Stars in film history (#22) (1995).      Donated his entire salary for Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) ($100,000) to the U.S. War Relief Fund.      He never said ""Judy, Judy, Judy"" in the movies, which he credits to Larry Storch, but he did say ""Susan, Susan, Susan"" in Bringing Up Baby (1938).      Was a great fan of Elvis Presley and attended his Las Vegas shows. He is seen discussing Elvis\' performance with him backstage during the closing credits of Elvis: That\'s the Way It Is (1970).      On American Film Institute\'s list of top 100 U.S. love stories, compiled in June 2002, Grant led all actors with six of his films on the list. His An Affair to Remember (1957) was ranked #5; followed by: #44 The Philadelphia Story (1940) #46 To Catch a Thief (1955) #51 Bringing Up Baby (1938) #77 The Awful Truth (1937) #86 Notorious (1946)      Pictured on a 37¢ USA commemorative postage stamp in the Legends of Hollywood series, issued 15 October 2002.      Turned down roles opposite Audrey Hepburn in both Roman Holiday (1953) and Sabrina (1954); later he starred with her in Charade (1963).      Although he became a Paramount Pictures contract player early in his film career, when the contract was up he made an unusual decision for the time: he decided to freelance. Because his films were so successful at the box office, he was able to work at any studio he chose for the majority of his career.      Biography in: ""Who\'s Who in Comedy"" by Ronald L. Smith, pg. 191-193. New York: Facts on File, 1992.  ISBN 0816023387      Thanks mainly to the strength and physical dexterity he gained as an acrobat when he was young, he did a majority of his own stunts during his film career (far more than people would think).Douglas Fairbanks was his boyhood idol, with Fairbanks\' ""healthy"" tan being the inspiration for Grant\'s constantly dark skin.      He remained close to Barbara Hutton\'s son Lance Reventlow after their divorce. The boy regularly stayed with Grant on some weekends. Grant referred to him as his son, was devastated when he died in a plane crash and helped Barbara with the funeral arrangements.      People were surprised by his retirement in 1966 and, despite the attempts of directors as important as Howard Hawks, Billy Wilder, and even Stanley Kubrick to get him out of retirement and into their films, he never worked again.      Paramount Pictures named him Cary Grant when he began his film career, because of the similarity of the name to Gary Cooper, their biggest male star, (C.G. being an inversion of G.C.) and possibly because Clark Gable had the same initials. Gable and Cooper were born with their last names, however, with Grant having been born Archibald Leach.      Named the #2 Greatest Actor on The Greatest Screen Legends list by the American Film Institute.      According to his will (dated November 26, 1984), his body was to be cremated and no funeral service held. His ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean.      He was voted the sixth Greatest Movie Star of all time by Entertainment Weekly.      The late Christopher Reeve said that he based his portrayal of Clark Kent in the Superman films on Grant in the early part of his career.      In His Girl Friday (1940), his character remarks, ""Archie Leach said that"", a reference to his real name.      Was hyperopic or ""far-sighted"". That is why in many publicity stills, he is seen holding a pair of glasses.John Cleese\'s character in A Fish Called Wanda (1988) was named ""Archie Leach"" after Grant\'s real name.      Was largely self-educated as he had dropped out of school at age 14. However, he was a voracious reader throughout his life.      Director Leo McCarey accused Grant of ripping off his persona during the time they shot The Awful Truth (1937) and using it as his own to become world-famous. What McCarey failed to notice was that many aspects of Grant\'s image were already developed in Sylvia Scarlett (1935), an otherwise poor Katharine Hepburn-George Cukor picture made two years before ""The Awful Truth"", and that his comic timing and versatility as an actor were all his own. Although ill at ease about it, they collaborated again several times.      Often spoke of his relationship with Sophia Loren as one of the most passionate romances in his life. She was 31 years his junior.      Was still in love with Sophia Loren when it came time for them to film Houseboat (1958). She went to director Melville Shavelson, in tears, complaining that Grant was chasing her again - she had told Grant she was in love with Carlo Ponti, but he did not believe her.      Fell madly in love with Sophia Loren while filming The Pride and the Passion (1957) when he was 53 and she was 22. At the time, Grant was still married to actress Betsy Drake, and Loren was involved with 45-year-old producer Carlo Ponti, who was also married. Both men eventually separated from their wives and proposed to Loren at the same time; she chose Ponti.      When Sophia Loren visited Los Angeles during the filming of An Affair to Remember (1957), Grant inundated her with dozens of phone calls and hundreds of flowers - even though she had called off the affair.      Participated in an experimental psychotherapy program in which he was prescribed LSD. Betsy Drake encouraged him to take the drug (as part of a medical experiment), as he wanted to examine his failed marriages. He underwent about 100 sessions, and said that he benefited greatly from them. However in later life, he said he would not have experimented with LSD if he had known about the side-effects, and asked people not to use drugs.      Premiere magazine ranked him as the #1 Movie Star of All Time in their ""Stars in Our Constellation"" feature (2005).      Maintained a year-round suntan to avoid wearing makeup.      Became the director of Fabergé cosmetics firm in 1966.Alfred Hitchcock once toyed with the idea of casting him as Hamlet (in what would have been a modern-dress film version of William Shakespeare\'s play), but he never got around to it.      In 1957, he accepted the Oscar for ""Best Actress in a Leading Role"" on behalf of Ingrid Bergman, who was not present at the awards ceremony.      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1610 Vine Street in Hollywood, California on February 8, 1960.      Replaced James Stewart as the hapless ad man Roger Thornhill in North by Northwest (1959). Stewart very much wanted the role, but director Alfred Hitchcock decided not to cast him because of the box office failure of Vertigo (1958), which Hitchcock blamed on Stewart for looking ""too old"" and chose Grant instead, even though he was actually four years older.      Was the original choice to play Rupert Cadell in Rope (1948), but he was unavailable, so the role went to James Stewart, instead (whom Grant would later replace as the lead in North by Northwest (1959)). Rope (1948) features references to Grant and the earlier Hitchcock film he appeared in, Notorious (1946) with Ingrid Bergman.      Introduced First Lady Betty Ford at the Republican National Convention in 1976.      On April 18, 1947, King George VI awarded Grant the King\'s Medal for Service in the Cause of Freedom, citing his ""outstanding service to the British War Relief Society"".      His performance as T.R. Devlin in Notorious (1946) is ranked #16 on Premiere magazine\'s 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006).      His performance as Dr. David Huxley in Bringing Up Baby (1938) is ranked #68 on Premiere magazine\'s 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006).      His favorite aftershave was Acqua Di Parma.      When his daughter Jennifer Grant was born, he gave wife Dyan Cannon a diamond and sapphire bracelet as a keepsake.      He had one of his daughter Jennifer Grant\'s first baby teeth encased in Lucite.      Writer Sidney Sheldon used Grant as the prototype for Rhys Williams, a character in the novel ""Bloodline"".      One of his favorite poems was a bit of doggerel: ""They bought me a box of tin soldiers,/I threw all the Generals away,/I smashed up the Sergents and Majors,/Now I play with my Privates all day."".      He was a huge baseball fan, originally supporting the New York Giants and then the Los Angeles Dodgers.      At one time, he owned a Sealyham terrier called Archie Leach.      He became an American citizen on June 26, 1942, under naturalization certificate #5502057.      As a child, he had a fear of knives and a fear of heights.      He always wore a gold chain around his neck with three charms attached. The three charms represented the religions of each of his former wives: a St. Christopher for Virginia Cherrill (Roman Catholic), a small cross for Barbara Hutton and Betsy Drake (Protestants), and a Star of David for Dyan Cannon (Jewish). (Donaldson).      Was considered one of the best-dressed men in the United States of America. George Francis Frazier, Jr., in ""The Art of Wearing Clothes"" (published in \'Esquire\' magazine, September 1960), wrote ""Although Grant, who is fifty-six, favors such abominations as large tie knots and claims to have originated the square-style breast-pocket handkerchief, he is so extraordinarily attractive that he looks good in practically anything. He insists upon tight armholes in his suit jackets, finds the most comfortable (and functional) of all underwear to be women\'s nylon panties."" Other best-dressed American men cited in the article were Miles Davis, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Clark Gable and Walter Pidgeon.      If you look closely at his teeth, you\'ll find that he only has one incisor (front tooth). Apparently when he was a boy he knocked out a tooth while ice skating. Rather than get into trouble with his father, he opted to go to a nearby dental college and have them gradually push his other teeth together to fill in the gap. Only one person (an eagle-eyed cinematographer) ever noticed and mentioned it to him. It\'s described in depth in the book ""Evenings with Cary Grant"".      Hated his performance in Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), saying it was way too over the top and that it was his least favorite film.      Was the only actor Alfred Hitchcock was said to ""love"". Hitch said that James Stewart was the ""everyman"", but never cast Stewart after Vertigo (1958) flopped, which he blamed on Stewart now looking too old to draw in the crowds. Ironically, Grant was actually four years older than Stewart.      Initally accepted his role in Houseboat (1958) because he was dating Sophia Loren, whom he was madly in love with. After she went and married someone else, heartbroken, Cary wanted to back out. He could not, but the director made sure the production was a smooth one.      Initially refused Stanley Donen\'s offer to appear in Charade (1963), but-realizing that it was a great part-accepted it after a while. He made one stipulation: Audrey Hepburn had to chase him, not visa-versa.      Was very hurt when he lost his two Academy Award nominations, particularly None But the Lonely Heart (1944), which he thought was his best performance. This is why he was so excited when he accepted his Honarary Academy Award in 1970.      Said Indiscreet (1958), to be his personal favorite film.      He gave serious consideration to retiring in 1953, because he believed the success of Marlon Brando and Method acting meant his own kind of acting was a thing of the past. Eighteen months later, he was lured back to make To Catch a Thief (1955), and therefore delayed his retirement until 1966.      Maintained good physical health until becoming sick with high blood pressure in the late 1970s. In October 1984, he suffered a minor stroke, which limited his appearances thereafter.      Received Kennedy Center honors in November 1981. President Ronald Reagan wrote how pleased he was to be able to honor his friend, while Grant stated that he was glad James Stewart was at the ceremony.      Held a press conference announcing his retirement from acting early in 1953, saying he was very angry over Hollywood\'s treatment of director Charles Chaplin, who had recently been blacklisted for his liberal political beliefs.      Attended the state funeral of his friend Earl Louis Mountbatten of Burma at Westminster Abbey in August 1979, and openly wept during the service.Alfred Hitchcock originally planned to cast Grant in the role of the publisher and Montgomery Clift as Brandon Rope (1948). However the established homosexual relationship between Leopold and Loeb, and the tacit recognition of a similar tie between Hamilton\'s killers, persuaded Grant and Clift to steer clear of the project to avoid long term commercial repercussions.      His final appearance at the Academy Awards was in 1985 to present James Stewart with an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement.      He often played characters who were considerably younger than his actual age. He was age 50 when To Catch a Thief (1955) was filmed, but was playing a character of age 34.      Biography in: ""The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives"". Volume Two, 1986-1990, pages 346-348. New York: Charles Scribner\'s Sons, 1999.      Although he had been considered a liberal during his career, after his retirement from acting he emerged as a major supporter of Richard Nixon in the late 1960s.      Smoked up to 60 cigarettes a day until 1957, when his third wife Betsy Drake made him give up in order to protect his voice. He quit smoking while filming An Affair to Remember (1957) after visiting a hypnotist. However, she recalled occasionally catching him smoking outside the house, so he probably never stopped completely.      He was considered for the leading role in Ladri di biciclette (1948).      Grant eagerly sought William Holden\'s role in The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), but the producers decided he was not right for the role, and in any case they felt he was too old at age 53.      He was director Howard Hawks\' first choice to play the lead in Man\'s Favorite Sport? (1964), which he turned down because he was age 59 and leading lady Paula Prentiss was age 25.      Turned down the role of gunfighter Cherry Valance, which was to have been much larger, in Howard Hawks\' epic western Red River (1948) opposite John Wayne and Montgomery Clift. The role went to John Ireland instead.      Was very close friends with Ingrid Bergman, his co-star in both Indiscreet (1958) and Notorious (1946). Grant was one of the few who supported her throughout her notorious affair with Rossellini, and while Bergman was in exile in Italy he accepted her Best Actress Oscar in 1958.      Always cited his To Catch a Thief (1955) co-star Grace Kelly as his favorite leading lady. He attended her state funeral in 1982 and wept throughout the televised service.      At the time of his death, his estate was valued at $60 million.      His mother, Elsie Maria Leach, passed away in January 1973 at age 94.      Underwent a hernia operation in the spring of 1977.      Had a benign tumor removed from his forehead in 1957.      Became seriously sick with infectious hepatitis and jaundice in 1948, and doctors gave him a less than 10% chance of survival. The problem was the damage that years of heavy drinking had done to his liver. Grant took more than six months to recover.      Eagerly sought the role of Midshipman Roger Byam in Mutiny on the Bounty (1935), which went to Franchot Tone instead.      Turned down James Mason\'s role in A Star Is Born (1954).      Turned down James Mason\'s role in Stanley Kubrick\'s Lolita (1962) because he considered the film ""depraved"".      He turned down the role of Professor Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady (1964) because he felt he would either not be as good as Rex Harrison, who had originated the part on the London stage and on Broadway, or he would be accused of imitating Harrison. He told producer Jack L. Warner that unless Harrison was cast, he would not even go to see the film.      In later years, he always said the character he played in Father Goose (1964) came closest to his real self.      He and his fifth wife Barbara Harris renewed their wedding vows on April 11, 1986, the fifth anniversary of their marriage.      In 1999, he was named the second Greatest Male Star of All Time of American cinema, after Humphrey Bogart, by the American Film Institute.      For a scene in The Grass Is Greener (1960), he refused to wear a smoking jacket, fearing he would immediately lose the support of the audience if he were seen dressed like that. The director later recalled that an old-fashioned kind of comedy had died that day, and it never came back.      After The Howards of Virginia (1940) flopped at the box office, Grant turned down all offers for historical epics until The Pride and the Passion (1957), which was also a failure.      He initially decided to end his 1953 retirement just to make To Catch a Thief (1955). When the film proved to be a huge success, he agreed to make further films.      He was involved in a serious car crash in New York, but fortunately escaped with only minor injuries. [March 1968]Elton John recalled that one of the highlights of his 1976 tour of the United States was meeting Grant backstage after a concert.      For several years, he had toyed with the idea of playing Hamlet in an attempt to prove to his critics that he could act. This idea was finally scuppered by Laurence Olivier\'s film Hamlet (1948).      He actively sought James Stewart\'s role in Bell Book and Candle (1958), and Clark Gable\'s role in Teacher\'s Pet (1958).      He and Charlton Heston attended a dinner at 10 Downing Street honoring the then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, whom they both greatly admired. Afterward Heston said to his wife Lydia Heston, ""You know I sat next to Mrs. Thatcher."" She replied, ""That\'s nothing--I got to sit next to Cary Grant!"".      He voted for Richard Nixon in 1968 and 1972, Gerald Ford in 1976 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984.      Once shared a house with his close friend Noël Coward early in his Hollywood career.      He considered himself to be miscast in The Howards of Virginia (1940), None But the Lonely Heart (1944) and The Pride and the Passion (1957).      Once lived with the silent movie star William Haines.Alfred Hitchcock told François Truffaut that Grant, unlike James Stewart, would have been willing to play a villain. Before he was a star, Stewart (unlike Grant) once actually played an out-and-out villain, in After the Thin Man (1936). The closest Grant came was the original version of Suspicion (1941), directed by Hitchcock, in which Grant\'s character poisoned his wife, but the film was recut so that Grant wouldn\'t be a bad guy.      His daughter, Jennifer Grant, gave birth to a son, Cary Benjamin Grant on August 12, 2008.      Loved performing on network radio, where he often got to perform in roles different from his screen persona. He once told the producers of the radio series ""Suspense"", ""Invite me back, invite me back."".      In 1968, he and fellow actor and friend Michael Caine were walking together and a fan approached them, only recognizing Caine. At the end of the conversation, the fan turned to Grant and commented how accommodating today\'s film stars are with the public, to which Grant nodded in agreement.      He can be seen in the audience and backstage in the Elvis Presley concert documentary Elvis: That\'s the Way It Is (1970).      Made a public appeal for gun control following the assassination of his friend Robert F. Kennedy. [June 1968]      He strongly disliked Method acting and never played a villain.      Was very good friends with Frederique ""Quique"" Jourdan, the wife of Louis Jourdan.      Grant introduced Frederick Brisson to future wife Rosalind Russell and acted as his best man at their marriage.      Has eight films on the American Film Institute\'s list of the 100 Funniest Movies: Bringing Up Baby (1938) at #14, The Philadelphia Story (1940) at #15, His Girl Friday (1940) at #19, Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) at #30, Topper (1937) at #60, The Awful Truth (1937) at #68, Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (1948) at #72 and She Done Him Wrong (1933) at #75.      Ran away from home at age 13 to join a mime troupe. His father tracked him down and brought him home, but he ran away again and rejoined the troupe.      He kept himself slender and fit until he retired acting, never weighing above 180 pounds.      Was once engaged to Queenie Smith.      Unlike several other major movie stars in his day, including James Stewart, John Wayne, Gary Cooper, etc., Grant never went bald and never needed to wear a toupee. Although he did dye his hair back to its natural black color when it started to gray in the 1950s. When he retired from acting in the 1960s, he stopped dying his hair and his hair was all-white by the time of his passing.      Holds the record at the Radio City Music Hall as its leading star. 27 films for a total of 113 weeks. Fred Astaire is the runner-up with 16 films for 60 weeks.      An executive of Paramount Pictures told struggling actor Archie Leach ""You\'re bow legged and your neck is far too thick."".      Though financially well off, he was considered ""tight"" by his servants. They reported that, among other things, he charged fans for his autograph, marked the height of the liquor in every bottle, counted the logs for the fireplace and kept a detailed record of how much food was bought and how much was consumed. However, he was well liked by his servants and paid them very well.      He played Irene Dunne\'s husband in three movies: The Awful Truth (1937), My Favorite Wife (1940) and Penny Serenade (1941).      Died three days before Desi Arnaz who died on December 2, 1986.      In his last years, he was a militant anti-smoker.      In 1971, fearful that Dyan Cannon would take their daughter Jennifer with her to New York and Europe, Grant filed for joint custody. When the judge ruled that Jennifer should remain in California with her father, taking time out to visit her mother, he was jubilant. He could plan to spend every evening waiting for her to come back from school and every weekend teaching her to ride a horse. Within eight weeks he had sold the rights to his last films with Universal for more than $2 million. Operation Petticoat (1959), The Grass Is Greener (1960), That Touch of Mink (1962) and Charade (1963) were all included, as was Penny Serenade (1941), the only one of his earlier films to which he still retained the rights. He had no more connection to the movie business. He invested in a property development in Malaga in southern Spain and another near Shannon in Ireland.      His daughter, Jennifer Grant, gave birth to a daughter, Davian Adele Grant, on November 23, 2011.      He was dismayed by the failure of Operation Musketeer, the Anglo-French attempt to regain the Suez Canal after it had been seized by the Nasser regime in Egypt. Israel invaded the Sinai peninsula. [November 1956]      He turned down the lead role in Gentleman\'s Agreement (1947) because he contended he was Jewish and thought he looked Jewish. He maintained, ""The public won\'t believe my portrayal of a gentile trying to pass himself off as a Jew."".      He was circumcised at birth, which was highly unusual in the United Kingdom in 1904.      He donated money to Israel in the name of his late mother.      He was usually considered poor at accents. His attempts at Cockney accents in Gunga Din (1939) and None But the Lonely Heart (1944) were widely ridiculed in the United Kingdom.      He appeared in four films directed by Alfred Hitchcock: Suspicion (1941), Notorious (1946), To Catch a Thief (1955) and North by Northwest (1959).      Cut back on his heavy drinking after his serious illness in 1948.Personal Quotes (65)      [responding to a wire from a reporter inquiring, ""How old Cary Grant?""] Old Cary Grant fine. How you?      I have spent the greater part of my life fluctuating between Archie Leach and Cary Grant, unsure of each, suspecting each.      Everybody wants to be Cary Grant. Even I want to be Cary Grant.      [About Burt Reynolds] As well as being my, and the world\'s favorite light comedian, Burt is a very considerate and thoughtful man.      My screen persona is a combination of Jack Buchanan, Noël Coward and Rex Harrison. I pretended to be somebody I wanted to be, and, finally, I became that person. Or he became me.      I improve on misquotation.      Divorce is a game played by lawyers.      To succeed with the opposite sex, tell her you are impotent; she can\'t wait to disprove it.      The only really good thing about acting is that there\'s no heavy lifting.      [1970 Honorary Oscar acceptance speech] You know that I may never look at this without remembering the quiet patience of directors who were so kind to me, who were kind enough to put up with me more than once, some of them even three or four times. I trust they and all the other directors, writers and producers and my leading women have forgiven me for what I didn\'t know. You know that I\'ve never been a joiner or a member of any particular social set, but I\'ve been privileged to be a part of Hollywood\'s most glorious era.      My formula for living is quite simple. I get up in the morning and I go to bed at night. In between, I occupy myself as best I can.      My father used to say, ""Let them see you and not the suit. That should be secondary.""      Mostly, we have manufactured ladies--- with the exception of Ingrid [Ingrid Bergman], Grace [Grace Kelly], Deborah [Deborah Kerr] and Audrey [Audrey Hepburn].      It takes 500 small details to add up to one favorable impression.      Actors today try to avoid comedy because if you write a comedy that\'s not a success, the lack of success is immediately apparent because the audience is not laughing. A comedy is a big risk. This is a tremendously costly business and to put money into a picture that might not come off -- oh, that\'s pretty risky.      This, I love. I enjoy talking back and forth to people. You know, otherwise, I wouldn\'t get to meet the people.      I tell you, in films, one doesn\'t really meet the audience. You don\'t get the impact or spirit of your audience, whereas when you are out in the public, you do.\'      I\'ve often been accused by critics of being myself on-screen. But being oneself is more difficult than you\'d suppose.      It\'s important to know where you\'ve come from so that you can know where you\'re going. I probably chose my profession because I was seeking approval, adulation, admiration and affection.      [on Irene Dunne] Her timing was marvelous. She was so good that she made comedy look easy. If she\'d made it look as difficult as it really is, she would have won her Oscar.      I know they nicknamed us ""Cash and Cary"", but I never asked Barbara Hutton for a penny. I never married a woman for money, that\'s the God\'s truth. I may not have married for very sound reasons, but money was the least of them.      [on his many marriages] It seems that each new marriage is more difficult to survive than the last one. I\'m rather a fool for punishment--I keep going back for more, don\'t ask me why.      [Charles Chaplin] is waiting a long time at a trolley car stop. He\'s the first in line of what turns out to be a huge crowd. The trolley finally arrives, he\'s the first one on, but then the crowd behind him surges through the door and pushes him right through the door on the other side. And that\'s a lot like what Hollywood is like. When you\'re a young man, Douglas Fairbanks Sr. is driving. Wallace Beery is the conductor, and Charles Chaplin\'s got a front-row seat. You take your seat, and back behind you is Gary Cooper. He has got his long feet stuck out in front of one of the exit doors, and people keep tripping over him and onto the street. Suddenly a young man named Tyrone Power gets on. He asks you to move over. You make a picture with Joan Fontaine. You think you do a good job, but she wins the Oscar, and you get nothing. And pretty soon more and more people get on, it\'s getting very crowded, and then you decide to get off. When you get off the trolley, you notice that it\'s been doing nothing but going around in circles. It doesn\'t go anywhere. You see the same things over and over. So you might as well get off.      [on Katharine Hepburn] She was this slip of a woman and I never liked skinny women. But she had this thing, this air you might call it, the most totally magnetic woman I\'d ever seen, and probably ever seen since. You had to look at her, you had to listen to her; there was no escaping her.      For more than thirty years of my life I had smoked with increasing habit. I was finally separated from the addiction by Betsy [wife Betsy Drake], who, after carefully studying hypnosis, practiced it, with my full permission and trust, as I was going off to sleep one night. She sat in a chair near the bed and, in a quiet, calm voice, rhythmically repeated what I inwardly knew to be true, the fact that smoking was not good for me; and, as my conscious mind relaxed and no longer cared to offer a negative thought, her words sank into my subconscious; and the following day, to my surprise I had no need or wish to smoke. Nor have I smoked since. Nor have I, as far as I know, replaced it with any other harmful habit.      Everyone tells me I\'ve had such an interesting life, but sometimes I think it\'s been nothing but stomach disturbances and self-concern.      I think making love is the best form of exercise.      I\'d like to have made one of those big splashy Technicolor musicals with Rita Hayworth.      There are only seven movie stars in the world whose name alone will induce American bankers to lend money for movie productions, and the only woman on the list is Ingrid Bergman.      [1980] I have nothing against gays, I\'m just not one myself.      [1965] I don\'t like to see men of my age making love on the screen. Being a father will make me more free than I have ever been. It will be a great experience. I can\'t wait.      There is no doubt I am aging. My format of comedy is still the same as ever. I gravitate toward scripts that put me in an untenable position. Then the rest of the picture is spent in trying to squirm out of it. Naturally, I always get the girl in the end. It may appear old-fashioned. There seems to be a trend toward satirical comedy, like The Apartment (1960). Perhaps it is because young writers today feel satirical living in a world that seems headed for destruction.      I can\'t portray Bing Crosby, I\'m Cary Grant. I\'m myself in that role. The most difficult thing is to be yourself - especially when you know it\'s going to be seen immediately by 300 million people.      The secret of comedy is doing it naturally under the most difficult circumstances. And film comedy is the most difficult of all. At least on stage you know right away if you\'re getting laughs or not. But making a movie, you have no way of knowing. So you try to time the thing for space and length and can only hope when it plays in the movie theaters months later that you have timed the thing right. It\'s difficult and it takes experience. I\'ll always remember the great actor, A.E. Matthews, who said on his death bed, ""Dying\'s tough--but not as tough as comedy"".      [Charles Chaplin] has given great pleasure to millions of people, and I hope he returns to Hollywood. Personally, I don\'t think he is a Communist, but whatever his political affiliations, they are secondary to the fact that he is a great entertainer. We should not go off the deep end.      [on Betsy Drake] Betsy was a delightful comedienne, but I don\'t think Hollywood was ever really her milieu. She wanted to help humanity, to help others help themselves.      [1981] I have no plans to write an autobiography, I will leave that to others. I\'m sure they will turn me into a homosexual or a Nazi spy or something else.      [1983] I asked James Stewart recently if he had thought about dying. He said he hadn\'t at all. But I have.      [In 1986 about Hollywood and drugs] I don\'t know anything about drugs. None of the people I know is involved with drugs. Hollywood is a very hard-working town - you have to get up early, and you have to look good. If you read the ""National Enquirer,"" you think drugs are everywhere, but I\'ve never seen them.      My intention in taking LSD was to make myself happy. A man would be a fool to take something that didn\'t make him happy. I took it with a group of men, one of whom was Aldous Huxley. We deceived ourselves by calling it therapy, but we were truly interested in how this chemical could help humanity. I found it a very enlightening experience, but it\'s like alcohol in one respect: a shot of brandy can save your life, but a bottle of brandy can kill you.      [In 1986 on actresses] I\'ve worked with Bergman. I\'ve worked with Hepburn. I\'ve worked with some of the biggest stars, but Grace Kelly was the best actress I\'ve ever worked with in my life. That woman was total relaxation, absolute ease - she was totally THERE. She was an extraordinarily serene girl. Both she and Hitchcock were Jesuit-trained; maybe that had something to do with it.      If I had known then what I know now, if I had not been so utterly stupid, I would have had a hundred children and I would have built a ranch to keep them on.      [Asked in 1986 why he no longer makes movies] There\'s too much heavy breathing and shooting going on.      Look at it this way, I\'ve always tried to dress well. I\'ve had some success in life. I\'ve enjoyed my success and I include in that success some relationships with very special women. If someone wants to say I\'m gay, what can I do? I think it\'s probably said about every man who\'s been known to do well with women. I don\'t let that sort of thing bother me. What matters to me is that I know who I am.      [In 1986 on what he finds attractive in a woman] A lack of artifice. I don\'t like a lot of make-up or a lot of perfume. If someone wears a lot of make-up, it shows me they\'re not happy with their features - it shows their insecurity.      I have no rapport with the new idols of the screen, and that includes Marlon Brando and his style of Method acting. It certainly includes Montgomery Clift and that God-awful James Dean. Some producer should cast all three of them in the same movie and let them duke it out. When they\'ve finished each other off, James Stewart, Spencer Tracy and I will return and start making real movies again like we used to.      When a young fellow like Louis Jourdan moves in on your field, you take stock of your assets and liabilities. It make you nervous.      Hollywood is very much like a streetcar. Once a new star is made and comes aboard, an old one is edged out of the rear exit. There\'s room for only so many and no more.      [on aging] When people tell you how young you look, they are also telling you how old you are.      [on Ingrid Bergman] She wears no make-up and has big feet and peasant hips, yet women envy her ability to be herself.      [on Marilyn Monroe, his co-star in Monkey Business (1952)] She seemed very shy, and I remember that when the studio workers would whistle at her, it seemed to embarrass her.      Let me call it \'coming on straight\'. It\'s easy to hide behind characters and roles. I think it\'s much tougher to be yourself.      I let people think or say whatever they want to. There have been all sorts of things written about me. It\'s an occupational hazard. But I don\'t particularly care. I live inside me. I can\'t control anyone\'s thoughts. I have enough trouble controlling my own.      I\'m sure I have that reputation because I don\'t gamble or go to nightclubs or give huge parties, and because I don\'t believe in giving gifts at Christmas. I give presents when I feel like it.      I\'m not very interested because that\'s something which is behind me now. I\'m more interested in living for today. I don\'t see films as being very real. Reality is what interests me now.      When people say, \'You\'ve led such a glamorous life,\' all I can honestly say is that I\'ve lived my life. It isn\'t glamorous to me.      I doubt if I have more than 70,000 hours left and I\'m not about to waste any of them. (1978)      They all left me. I didn\'t leave any of them. They all walked out on me. Maybe my marriages were heavily influenced by something in my subconscious that\'s related to my early years and the way I envisioned my mother. That\'s a pat answer, I know, but it\'s very possible. However, I\'m not really sure why they left me. Maybe they just got bored. It took a lot of psychiatry was necessary. It didn\'t all happen at once. It got piled on in layers. Thick layers, one on top of the other. It took time to undo.      Once I found that formula I mentioned, I was pretty much the same in all my films. I simply changed the leading ladies and those terrible situations. But I always tried to play Cary Grant. Did you know that I seldom wore makeup? I didn\'t want any of that. As for being as charming as the chap on the screen, I hope I sometimes am.      I like money. Anybody you know who doesn\'t? He\'s a liar.      I underwent heavy psychiatric therapy. I did weekly sessions of controlled LSD therapy. There were about a hundred sessions in all - two years\' worth about twenty-five or thirty years ago. At first I found it unbelievably painful. In the beginning I didn\'t want to go back. The sessions lasted six hours each. I would run the gamut of emotions from deep pain with tears running down my face to light-headed, almost drunken laughter. But I got my tape clean. I remember at one point lying on the doctor\'s couch, squirming around, moving around in small circles, telling myself that I was unscrewing myself. I told myself that I was getting unscrewed up. When each session ended, I was drained. I\'d go home to sleep. But when each session ended, I knew that I had cleaned off a little more of my tape. It took two years, but it was necessary for my evolution.      Films? You know, if some people had their way, I should never have made any films. I failed my first screen test. The director thought my neck was too thick. And he was right. I made seventy or seventy-one films. One of the films that I think shows a successful bit of acting is None But the Lonely Heart. That\'s where I found a form that fitted me. I played a well-dressed, fairly sophisticated chap who is put into intolerable situations. It\'s a formula, and I used it often. I think Indiscreet and Notorious, both with Ingrid Bergman, are good. They hold up.      I know all too well that the day will come when I won\'t be around any longer. The prospect of that doesn\'t necessarily please me. That\'s another reason why I live for today. That\'s another reason why reality is so important to me. I travel. I enjoy myself. I spend time with my daughter. I love life. That\'s the way I hope to keep on going. I enjoy whatever it is I do. If I don\'t enjoy something, I don\'t do it. I admit I used to worry that when you reached a certain age, things stopped happening. But I don\'t worry about that anymore because - and it\'s a pleasure to tell you - they don\'t stop happening. I haven\'t stopped doing anything simply because of my age. In fact, I know a man who is almost ten years older than I am and he doesn\'t have any troubles.      Archie Leach the dropout/runaway from Bristol studied men like Noël Coward and became Cary Grant.      I was raised mostly by my father.

Her mother, known as Lelee, went to Independence to have Ginger away from her husband. She had a baby earlier in their marriage and he allowed the doctor to use forceps and the baby died. She was kidnapped by her father several times until her mother took him to court. Ginger\'s mother left her child in the care of her parents while she went in search of a job as a scriptwriter in Hollywood and later to New York City. Mrs. McMath found herself with an income good enough to where she could send for Ginger. Lelee became a Marine in 1918 and was in the publicity department and Ginger went back to her grandparents in Missiouri. During this time her mother met John Rogers. After leaving the Marines they married in May, 1920 in Liberty, Missouri. He was transferred to Dallas and Ginger (who treated him as a father) went too. Ginger won a Charleston contest in 1925 (age 14) and a 4 week contract on the Interstate circuit. She also appeared in vaudeville acts which she did until she was 17 with her mother by her side to guide her. Now she had discovered true acting. She married in March, 1929, and after several months realized she had made a mistake. She acquired an agent and she did several short films. She went to New York where she appeared in the Broadway production of ""Top Speed"" which debuted Christmas Day, 1929. Her first film was in 1929 in A Night in a Dormitory (1930). It was a bit part, but it was a start. Later that year, Ginger appeared, briefly in two more films, A Day of a Man of Affairs (1929) and Campus Sweethearts (1930). For awhile she did both movies and theatre. The following year she began to get better parts in films such as Office Blues (1930) and The Tip-Off (1931). But the movie that enamored her to the public was Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933). She did not have top billing but her beauty and voice was enough to have the public want more. One song she popularized in the film was the now famous, ""We\'re in the Money"". Also in 1933 she was in 42nd Street (1933). She suggested using a monocle and this also set her apart. In 1934, she starred with Dick Powell in Twenty Million Sweethearts (1934). It was a well received film about the popularity of radio. Ginger\'s real stardom occurred when she was teamed with Fred Astaire where they were one of the best cinematic couples ever to hit the silver screen. This is where she achieved real stardom. They were first paired in 1933\'s Flying Down to Rio (1933) and later in 1935\'s Roberta (1935) and Top Hat (1935). Ginger also appeared in some very good comedies such as Bachelor Mother (1939) and Fifth Avenue Girl (1939) both in 1939. Also that year she appeared with Astaire in The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939). The film made money but was not anywhere successful as they had hoped. After that studio executives at RKO wanted Ginger to strike out on her own. She made several dramatic pictures but it was 1940\'s Kitty Foyle (1940) that allowed her to shine. Playing a young lady from the wrong side of the tracks, she played the lead role well, so well in fact, that she won an Academy Award for her portrayal. Ginger followed that project with the delightful comedy, Tom, Dick and Harry (1941) the following year. It\'s a story where she has to choose which of three men she wants to marry. Through the rest of the 1940s and early 1950s she continued to make movies but not near the caliber before World War II. After Oh, Men! Oh, Women! (1957) in 1957, Ginger didn\'t appear on the silver screen for seven years. By 1965, she had appeared for the last time in Harlow (1965). Afterward, she appeared on Broadway and other stage plays traveling in Europe, the U.S. and Canada. After 1984, she retired and wrote an autobiography in 1991 entitled, ""Ginger, My Story"" which is a very good book. On April 25, 1995, Ginger died of natural causes in Rancho Mirage, California. She was 83.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Denny Jackson          Spouse (5) William Marshall (16 March\xa01961            - 1969)\xa0(divorced)           Jacques Bergerac (7 February\xa01953            - 7 July\xa01957)\xa0(divorced)           Jack Briggs (16 January\xa01943            - 7 September\xa01949)\xa0(divorced)           Lew Ayres (14 November\xa01934            - 20 March\xa01941)\xa0(divorced)           Jack Pepper (29 March\xa01929            - 11 July\xa01931)\xa0(divorced)          Trade Mark (2)        Often starred with Fred Astaire        Corn-fed good looksTrivia (53)      Daughter of Lela E. Rogers.      Was a Christian Scientist.      Was given the name ""Ginger"" by her little cousin who couldn\'t pronounce ""Virginia"" correctly.      Brought her first cousin Helen Nichols to Hollywood, renamed her Phyllis Fraser, and guided her through a few films. Phyllis Fraser married and then became known as Phyllis Fraser.      Interred at Oakwood Memorial Park, Chatsworth, California, USA, the same cemetery as long-time dancing/acting partner Fred Astaire is located.      Sort-of cousin of Rita Hayworth. Rogers\' aunt married Hayworth\'s uncle.      She didn\'t drink alcohol and had her very own ice cream soda fountain.      Directed her first stage musical, ""Babes In Arms"", at age 74.      Was fashion consultant for the J.C. Penney chain from 1972-1975.      A keen artist, Rogers did many paintings, sculptures and sketches in her free time, but could never bring herself to sell any of them.      Was Hollywood\'s highest-paid star of 1942.      Author Graham Greene always said he would have liked Rogers to play the role of Aunt Augusta in the film version of his novel ""Travels With My Aunt"". When the film Travels with My Aunt (1972) was made in 1972, the role was played by Maggie Smith.      The well-known quote often attributed to her - ""My first picture was [Kitty Foyle (1940)]. It was my mother [Lela E. Rogers] who made all those films with Fred Astaire"" - was actually fabricated for a 1966 article in ""Films In Review"".      Always the outdoor sporty type, she was a near-champion tennis player, a topline shot and loved going fishing.      She made her final public appearance on March 18, 1995 (just five weeks before her death) when she received the Women\'s International Center (WIC) Living Legacy Award.      Was badly affected by illness in her last years after suffering two strokes that had left her wheelchair-bound and visibly overweight, while her voice had become a shrunken rasp.      Related to Random House publisher and What\'s My Line? (1950) panelist Bennett Cerf through marriage; Cerf married Rogers\' cousin Phyllis Fraser.      Was asked to replace Judy Garland in both Harlow (1965) and Valley of the Dolls (1967). Rogers turned down \'Valley of the Dolls\' because she hated the script; she did, however, accept \'Harlow\'.      First cousin, once removed, of Christopher Cerf and Jonathan Cerf.      Was a life-long Republican.      Turned down lead roles in To Each His Own (1946) and The Snake Pit (1948). Both of these roles went on to be played to great acclaim by Olivia de Havilland.      Her first teaming with Fred Astaire, Flying Down to Rio (1933), was her 20th film appearance but only Astaire\'s second.      In a 1991 TV interview, when asked why the Fred Astaire / Rogers union wasn\'t known as ""Ginger & Fred"" rather than ""Fred & Ginger"" (as Rogers had been in films longer), she replied, ""It\'s a man\'s world"".      Her tied-to-the-hip relationship with her mother, Lela E. Rogers, proved eternal. They\'re buried side by side at Oakwood Memorial Park. The grave of Ginger\'s screen partner, Fred Astaire, is just yards away.      Was named #14 actress on the American Film Institute\'s list of 50 Greatest Screen Legends.      Is one of the many movie stars mentioned in Madonna\'s song ""Vogue"".      She and Fred Astaire acted in 10 movies together: The Barkleys of Broadway (1949), Carefree (1938), Flying Down to Rio (1933), Follow the Fleet (1936), The Gay Divorcee (1934), Roberta (1935), Shall We Dance (1937), The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939), Swing Time (1936), and Top Hat (1935).      A distant cousin of Lucille Ball, according to Lucie Arnaz.      She was of Scottish, Welsh, English, and Irish ancestry.      During the last years of her life, she retired in Oregon and bought a ranch in the Medford area because she liked the climate. She donated money to the community and funded the Craterian Ginger Rogers Theater in downtown Medford, which was named after her.      In Italy, most of her films were dubbed by either Lidia Simoneschi or Wanda Tettoni. She was occasionally dubbed by Andreina Pagnani, Dhia Cristiani, Rosetta Calavetta, and Giovanna Scotto.      Has a street named after her in Rancho Mirage, California, her final winter home. Ginger Rogers Road is located in the Mission Hills Golf Course. It crosses Bob Hope Drive, between Gerald Ford Drive and Dinah Shore Drive and two blocks from Frank Sinatra Drive.      She was a conservative Republican, a proud member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, a Christian Scientist and a vocal supporter of the Hollywood blacklist.      Salary for 1938: $219,500 (adjusted for 2017 inflation: approximately $3.8 million).      One of the celebrities whose picture Anne Frank placed on the wall of her bedroom in the ""Secret Annex"" while in hiding during the Nazi occupation of Amsterdam, Holland.      Her great-great-grandfather was a doctor who discovered quinine, the cure for malaria.      For the ""Cheek to Cheek"" number in Top Hat (1935), she wanted to wear an elaborate blue dress heavily decked out with ostrich feathers. When director Mark Sandrich and Fred Astaire saw the dress, they knew it would be impractical for the dance. Sandrich suggested that Rogers wear the white gown she had worn performing ""Night and Day"" in The Gay Divorcee (1934). Rogers walked off the set, finally returning when Sandrich agreed to let her wear the offending blue dress. As there was no time for rehearsals, she wore the blue feathered dress for the first time during filming of the ""Cheek to Cheek"" number, and as Astaire and Sandrich had feared, feathers started coming off the dress. Astaire later claimed it was like ""a chicken being attacked by a coyote"". In the final film, some stray feathers can be seen drifting off it. To patch up the rift between them, Astaire presented Rogers with a charm of a gold feather to add to her charm bracelet. This was the origin of Rogers\' nickname ""Feathers"". The shedding feathers episode was recreated to hilarious results in a scene from Easter Parade (1948) in which Astaire danced with a clumsy, comical dancer played by Judy Garland.      Turned down Donna Reed\'s role in It\'s a Wonderful Life (1946).      She first introduced the song ""The Continental"" in The Gay Divorcee (1934) and it went on to be the first song that won an Academy Award for Best Original Song.      Replaced Judy Garland in the film The Barkleys of Broadway (1949) after Garland was suspended from MGM due to her tardiness.      Was offered the part of Hildy Johnson in His Girl Friday (1940), but she turned it down. Rosalind Russell was cast instead.      Inducted into the Hall of Famous Missourians in 2009.      Was good friends with actress Maureen O\'Hara since the late 1930s.      When Rogers received a Kennedy Center Honor in 1992, Robyn Smith, widow of Fred Astaire, withheld all rights to clips of Rogers\' scenes with Astaire, demanding payment. The Kennedy Center refused and Rogers received her honor without the retrospective show.      All of her five marriages lasted under a decade. Her longest marriage was her last, to William Marshall, which lasted eight years. She never had children.      Rogers holds the record for actresses at New York\'s prestigious Rdio City Music Hall with 23 films for a total of 55 weeks.      According to the 1974 book ""Holly-Would"", Rogers was taught the Charleston by Eddie Foy Jr. and went on the win the championship of Texas when she was only 15.      Was the 16th actress to receive an Academy Award; she won the Best Actress Oscar for Kitty Foyle (1940) at The 13th Academy Awards on February 27, 1941.Fred Astaire confided in Raymond Rohauer, curator of New York Gallery of Modern Art, ""Ginger was brilliantly effective. She made everything work fine for her. Actually she made things very fine for both of us and she deserves most of the credit for our success"".      Made the cover of Life magazine four times: August 22, 1938, December 9, 1940, March 2, 1942, and September 5, 1951.      In 1976, when Fred Astaire was asked by British TV interviewer Michael Parkinson on Parkinson (1971) who his favorite dancing partner was, Astaire answered, ""Excuse me, I must say Ginger was certainly the one. You know the most effective partner I ever had. Everyone knows. That was a whole other thing what we did...I just want to pay a tribute to Ginger because we did so many pictures together and believe me it was a value to have that girl...she had it. She was just great!"".      In 1986, Fred Astaire recalled, ""All the girls I ever danced with thought they couldn\'t do it. So they always cried. All except Ginger. No, no, Ginger never cried"".      She turned down Barbara Stanwyck\'s role in Ball of Fire (1941).Personal Quotes (36)      My mother [Lela E. Rogers] told me I was dancing before I was born. She could feel my toes tapping wildly inside her for months.      When two people love each other, they don\'t look at each other, they look in the same direction.      [1983] They\'re not going to get my money to see the junk that\'s made today.      The only way to enjoy anything in this life is to earn it first.      [early 1930s] I don\'t know which I like best. I love the applause on the stage. But pictures are so fascinating - you reach many millions through them. And you make more money, too.      When you\'re happy, you don\'t count the years.      Hollywood is like an empty wastebasket.      [on her partnership with Fred Astaire] After all, it\'s not as if we were Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. We did have careers apart from each other.      The most important thing in anyone\'s life is to be giving something. The quality I can give is fun, joy and happiness. This is my gift.      [on working with Katharine Hepburn] She is snippy, you know, which is a shame. She was never on my side.      [1987] It\'d be fun to have a chum around, but it\'s very hard to have a chum unless you\'re married to him. And I don\'t believe in today\'s concept for living with someone unmarried.      Even when one is of a certain age to make one\'s own decisions, there are many times when it is great to be able to go back and talk it over with the people one loves - one\'s family.      [her explanation for bringing excess luggage to London in 1969 for her year-long stint on stage as ""Mame""] I believe in dressing for the occasion. There\'s a time for sweater, sneakers and Levis and a time for the full-dress jazz. As for the little touches, well, a year is quite a long time and they make one feel at home.      [on her screen partnership with Fred Astaire] We had fun and it shows. True, we were never bosom buddies off the screen; we were different people with different interests. We were only a couple on film.      I\'m most grateful to have had that joyous time in motion pictures. It really was a Golden Age of Hollywood. Pictures were talking, they were singing, they were coloring. It was beginning to blossom out: bud and blossom were both present.      In everything that I do I learn and try to put it to use. I have learned to go through life not into it. It\'s like a boat. You mustn\'t let the water in or you\'re sunk. Of course, I\'ve made mistakes and I have had failures, but I do not dwell on them because people don\'t care about garbage. When I make a mistake it\'s like a bad leaf on a lettuce - I throw it out into the wastebasket.      I don\'t care what the critics say. My fabulous mom [Lela E. Rogers] will give me a good review if nobody else does.      You bring out a lot of your own thoughts and attitudes when acting. I think a great deal of it has to do with the inner you. You know, there\'s nothing damnable about being a strong woman. The world needs strong women. There are a lot of strong women you do not see who are guiding, helping, mothering strong men. They want to remain unseen. It\'s kind of nice to be able to play a strong woman who is seen.      It was tough being a woman in the theatrical business in those days.      [1975] The were such a pretty time. I know it was a bad time for an awful lot of people, but not for me. I remember the whole atmosphere, the ambiance of the [1930s] with a glow because success was knocking at my door. I got to California in [1932], just in time to do Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933), where I sang ""We\'re In the Money"". It was a whole new life for me. I was excited about it. It was happy and beautiful and gay and interesting. I was surrounded by marvelous people, all the top people of our industry.      I think the motion pictures talked themselves out of business when they sold their backlogs [to TV networks]. They sold what they thought were old clothes. It turns out some of them had better material in them than their new ones.      [on being asked in 1943 what a girl needs to be a movie star] Intelligence, adaptability and talent. And by talent I mean the capacity for hard work. Lots of girls come here with little but good looks. Beauty is a valuable asset, but it is not the whole cheese.      Rhythm is born in all of us. To be a desirable dancing partner you don\'t have to do all the intricate fancy steps that happen to be in vogue. All you have to do is be a good average dancer and anybody who spends the time and effort can accomplish this.      I believe in living each day as it comes, to the best of my ability. When it\'s done, I put it away, remembering that there will be a tomorrow to take it\'s place. If I have any philosophy, that\'s it. To me it\'s not a fatalistic attitude.      [1976, on Fred Astaire] I adore the man. I always have adored him. It was the most fortunate thing that ever happened to me, being teamed with Fred: he was everything a little starry-eyed girl from a small town ever dreamed of.      [on Howard Hughes] Howard was one of the best dancers I ever knew, and fascinating to be with. Terribly bright and intelligent. But he was immersed in his work.      I\'ve made thousands of mistakes, but they\'ve all been stepping stones toward a better concept of life.      Gossip is hardly uplifting.      I won\'t go to movies with permissiveness, four-letter words, or violence. Show me E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and Chariots of Fire (1981) instead. That\'s entertainment, not exploitation of the human body.      You\'ve got to stand for something or you\'ll fall for anything.      Part of the joy of dancing is conversation. Trouble is, some men can\'t talk and dance at the same time.      Looking back at my life\'s voyage, I can only say that it has been a golden trip.      Perhaps I am old-fashioned, but black and white films still hold an affectionate place in my heart; they have an incomparable mystique and mood.      There\'s nothing a man can do, that I can\'t do better and in heels.      There are no small parts. Only small actors.      The fun, joy, and humor dry up in a relationship when one of the partners is swimming in gin. To my way of thinking, it is selfishness personified to see life through the bottom of a liquor bottle.Salary (1)The Barkleys of Broadway\xa0(1949)      $12,500 /week          if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nCharles Coburn ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 32 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(5)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(2)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(20)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(2)\xa0|Salary\xa0(1)  Overview (5)Date of Birth19\xa0June1877,\xa0Savannah, Georgia, USA Date of Death30\xa0August1961,\xa0New York City, New York, USA      \xa0(heart attack)    Birth NameCharles Douville CoburnNicknameThe Monocle from Georgia    Height6\'\xa0(1.83\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          A cigar-smoking, monocled, swag-bellied character actor known for his Old South manners and charm.

His famous monocle was no affectation, but actually corrected an eye deficiency. ""No point having two window panes where one will do,"" was always his explanation.      On February 28, 2012, Coburn\'s Oscar statuette was auctioned by Nate D. Sanders Memorabilia. It sold for $170,459.      Started as an usher and doorman at a theater in his hometown of Savannah, Georgia. By age 17, he had become manager of that establishment. He later turned to acting himself and made his bow on Broadway in 1901.      Formed a repertory company with his actress-wife Ivah Wills, which endured until her death in 1937.      Loved to play poker.      He always carried a stack of cards with his autograph already written on them to satisfy fan requests.      Although he was born in Macon, Georgia, he was often thought to be English.      Made his Broadway debut in ""Up York State"" in 1901.      Auditioned for the role of Judge Hardy in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\'s famous Andy Hardy series. Although he did not get the role, he was noticed by director Clarence Brown, who cast him in Of Human Hearts (1938).      When asked by a reporter why he did not wear his omnipresent monocle while eating, he replied, ""I once lost one in a bowl of soup."".      The University of Georgia held a special day of celebration on January 30, 1956, as a distinguished native Georgian. The university has his archived library, correspondence, and memorabilia.      He instructed his executor not to have a public funeral or burial. He wished to have his body cremated and his ashes mixed and scattered in various locations with those of his wife, who had died many years before.      Studied the techniques of such late 19th-century stars as Henry Irving, DeWolf Hopper Sr., John Drew and Richard Mansfield when he was a young theater usher.      In the late 1930s and early 1940s, he only stayed eight months a year in Hollywood. He returned east each summer to New York, which he considered home. In 1946, he moved to Hollywood full time.      In 1928, he opened his own theater, the Coburn Theater, on Manhattan\'s 63rd Street, but the Depression brought hard times and he was forced to declare bankruptcy in December 1932.      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6268 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on February 8, 1960.      According to Piper Laurie in her memoirs (Learning To Love Out Loud), Charles Coburn loved pinching women\'s bottoms. It was for him like a tic. Every female under one hundred and five had to move fast around. But no one ever considered reporting from sexual harassment.      Said in an interview with local news reporters that his movie career began when he stood on the corner of Broughton Street in downtown Savannah, GA handing out playbills for the two downtown theaters.      Was an honorary member of the Bohemian Club.Personal Quotes (2)      [a story he told fans each year at the Delaware County (OH) Fair Little Brown Jug Stakes for pacers, which as a devoted harness-racing fan he attended annually] I grew up in the city not far from a burlesque theater and my father cautioned me not to go there because I might see something I shouldn\'t see.

Her mother Gladys Pearl Baker was a film-cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. Marilyn\'s father\'s identity was never known. Because Gladys was mentally and financially unable to care for young Marilyn, Gladys placed her in the care of a foster family, The Bolenders. Although the Bolender family wanted to adopt Marilyn, Gladys was eventually able to stabilize her lifestyle and took Marilyn back in her care when Marilyn was 7 years old. However, shortly after regaining custody of Marilyn, Gladys had a complete mental breakdown and was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and was committed to a state mental hospital. Gladys spent the rest of her life going in and out of hospitals and did not have contact with Marilyn ever again. Gladys outlived her daughter, dying in 1984.Marilyn was then taken in by Gladys\' best friend Grace Goddard, who, after a series of foster homes, placed Marilyn into the Los Angeles Orphan\'s Home in 1935. Marilyn was traumatized by her experience there despite the Orphan\'s Home being an adequate living facility. Grace Goddard eventually took Marilyn back to live with her in 1937 although this stay did not last long as Grace\'s husband began molesting Marilyn. Marilyn went to live with Grace\'s Aunt Ana after this incident, although due to Aunt Ana\'s advanced age she could not care properly for Marilyn. Marilyn once again for the third time had to return to live with the Goddard\'s. The Goddard\'s planned to relocated and according to law, could not take Marilyn with them. She only had two choices: return to the orphanage or get married. Marilyn was only 16 years old.She decided to marry a neighborhood friend named James Dougherty; he went into the military, she modeled, they divorced in 1946. She owned 200 books (including Tolstoy, Whitman, Milton), listened to Beethoven records, studied acting at the Actors\' lab in Hollywood, and took literature courses at UCLA downtown. 20th Century Fox gave her a contract but let it lapse a year later. In 1948, Columbia gave her a six-month contract, turned her over to coach Natasha Lytess and featured her in the B movie Ladies of the Chorus (1948) in which she sang three numbers : ""Every Baby Needs a Da Da Daddy"", ""Anyone Can Tell I Love You"" and ""The Ladies of the Chorus"" with Adele Jergens (dubbed by Virginia Rees) and others. Joseph L. Mankiewicz saw her in a small part in The Asphalt Jungle (1950) and put her in All About Eve (1950), resulting in 20th Century re-signing her to a seven-year contract. Niagara (1953) and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) launched her as a sex symbol superstar.When she went to a supper honoring her in the The Seven Year Itch (1955), she arrived in a red chiffon gown borrowed from the studio (she had never owned a gown). That same year, she married and divorced baseball great Joe DiMaggio (their wedding night was spent in Paso Robles, California). After The Seven Year Itch (1955), she wanted serious acting to replace the sexpot image and went to New York\'s Actors Studio. She worked with director Lee Strasberg and also underwent psychoanalysis to learn more about herself. Critics praised her transformation in Bus Stop (1956) and the press was stunned by her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller. True to form, she had no veil to match her beige wedding dress so she dyed one in coffee; he wore one of the two suits he owned. They went to England that fall where she made The Prince and the Showgirl (1957) with Laurence Olivier, fighting with him and falling further prey to alcohol and pills. Two miscarriages and gynecological surgery followed. So did an affair with Yves Montand. Work on her last picture The Misfits (1961), written for her by departing husband Miller was interrupted by exhaustion. She was dropped from the unfinished Something\'s Got to Give (1962) due to chronic lateness and drug dependency.On August 4, 1962, Marilyn Monroe\'s day began with threatening phone calls. Dr. Ralph Greenson, Marilyn\'s physician, came over the following day and quoted later in a document ""felt it was possible that Marilyn Monroe had felt rejected by some of the people she had been close to"". Apart from being upset that her publicist slept too long, she seemed fine. Pat Newcombe, who had stayed the previous night at Marilyn\'s house, left in the early evening as did Greenson who had a dinner date. Marilyn was upset he couldn\'t stay, and around 7:30pm she telephoned him while she was to tell him that her second husband\'s son had called him. Peter Lawford also called Marilyn, inviting her to dinner, but she declined. Lawford later said her speech was slurred. As the dark and depressing evening for Marilyn wore on there were other phone calls, including one from Jose Belanos, who said he thought she sounded fine. According to the funeral directors, Marilyn died sometime between 9:30pm and 11:30pm. Her maid unable to raise her but seeing a light under her locked door, called the police shortly after midnight. She also phoned Ralph Greenson who, on arrival, could not break down the bedroom door. He eventually broke in through French windows and found Marilyn dead in bed. The coroner stated she had died from acute barbiturate poisoning, and it was a \'probable suicide\'.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Ed Stephan <stephan@cc.wwu.edu>                    Probably the most celebrated of all actresses, Marilyn Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson on June 1, 1926, in the charity ward of the Los Angeles General Hospital. Prior to her birth, Marilyn\'s father bought a motorcycle and headed north to San Francisco, abandoning the family in Los Angeles. Marilyn grew up not knowing for sure who her father really was. Her mother, Gladys, had entered into several relationships, further confusing her daughter as to who it was who fathered her. Afterward, Gladys gave Norma Jeane (Marilyn) the name of Baker, a boyfriend she had before Mortenson. Poverty was a constant companion to Gladys and Norma. Gladys, who was extremely attractive and worked for RKO Studios as a filmcutter, suffered from mental illness and was in and out of mental institutions for the rest of her life, and because of that Norma Jeane spent time in foster homes. When she was nine, she was placed in an orphanage where she was to stay for the next two years. Upon being released from the orphanage, she went to yet another foster home. In 1942, at age 16, Norma Jeane married 21-year-old aircraft plant worker James Dougherty. The marriage only lasted four years, and they divorced in 1946. By this time, Marilyn began to model swimsuits and bleached her hair blonde. Various shots made their way into the public eye, where some were eventually seen by RKO Pictures head Howard Hughes. He offered Marilyn a screen test, but an agent suggested that 20th Century-Fox would be the better choice for her, since it was a much bigger and more prestigious studio. She was signed to a contract at $125 per week for a six-month period and that was increased by $25 per week at the end of that time when her contract was lengthened.Her first film was in 1947 with a bit part in The Shocking Miss Pilgrim (1947). Her next production was not much better, a bit in the eminently forgettable Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay! (1948). Two of the three brief scenes in which she appeared wound up on the cutting room floor. Later that same year, she was given a somewhat better role as Evie in Dangerous Years (1947). However, Fox declined to renew her contract, so she went back to modeling and acting school.Columbia Pictures then picked her up to play Peggy Martin in Ladies of the Chorus (1948), where she sang two numbers. Notices from the critics were favorable for her, if not the film, but Columbia dropped her. Once again Marilyn returned to modeling. In 1949, she appeared in United Artists\' Love Happy (1949). It was also that same year she posed nude for the now famous calendar shot which was later to appear in Playboy magazine in 1953 and further boost her career. She would be the first centerfold in that magazine\'s long and illustrious history. The next year proved to be a good year for Marilyn. She appeared in five films, but the good news was that she received very good notices for her roles in two of them, The Asphalt Jungle (1950) from MGM and All About Eve (1950) from Fox. Even though both roles were basically not much more than bit parts, movie fans remembered her dizzy but very sexy blonde performance.In 1951, Marilyn got a fairly sizable role in Love Nest (1951). The public was now getting to know her and liked what it saw. She had an intoxicating quality of volcanic sexuality wrapped in an aura of almost childlike innocence. In 1952, Marilyn appeared in Don\'t Bother to Knock (1952), in which she played a somewhat mentally unbalanced babysitter. Critics didn\'t particularly care for her work in this picture, but she made a much more favorable impression later in the year in Monkey Business (1952), where she was seen for the first time as a platinum blonde, a look that became her trademark. The next year, she appeared in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) as Lorelei Lee. It was also the same year she began dating the baseball great Joe DiMaggio.Marilyn was now a genuine box-office drawing card. Later, she appeared with Betty Grable, Lauren Bacall and Rory Calhoun in How to Marry a Millionaire (1953). Although her co-stars got the rave reviews, it was the sight of Marilyn that really excited the audience, especially the male members. On Thursday, January 14th, 1954, Marilyn wed DiMaggio, then proceeded to film There\'s No Business Like Show Business (1954). That was quickly followed by The Seven Year Itch (1955), which showcased her considerable comedic talent and contained what is arguably one of the most memorable moments in cinema history: Marilyn standing above a subway grating and the wind from a passing subway blowing her white dress up.By October 1954, Marilyn announced her divorce from DiMaggio. The union lasted only eight months. In 1955, she was suspended by Fox for not reporting for work on How to Be Very, Very Popular (1955). It was her second suspension, the first being for not reporting for the production of The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955). Both roles went to others. Her work was slowing down, due to her habit of being continually late to the set, her illnesses (whether real or imagined) and generally being unwilling to cooperate with her producers, directors, and fellow actors.However in Bus Stop (1956), Marilyn finally showed critics that she could play a straight dramatic role. It was also the same year she married playwright, Arthur Miller (they divorced in 1960). In 1957, Marilyn flew to Britain to film The Prince and the Showgirl (1957) which proved less than impressive critically and financially. It made money, but many critics panned it for being slow-moving. After a year off in 1958, Marilyn returned to the screen the next year for the delightful comedy, Some Like It Hot (1959) with Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. The film was an absolute smash hit, with Curtis and Lemmon pretending to be females in an all-girl band, so they can get work. This was to be Marilyn\'s only film for the year.In 1960, Marilyn appeared in George Cukor\'s Let\'s Make Love (1960), with Tony Randall and Yves Montand. Again, while it made money, it was critically panned as stodgy and slow-moving. The following year, Marilyn made what was to be her final film. The Misfits (1961), which also proved to be the final film for the legendary Clark Gable, who died later that year of a heart attack. The film was popular with critics and the public alike. In 1962, Marilyn was chosen to star in Fox\'s Something\'s Got to Give (1962). Again, her absenteeism caused delay after delay in production, resulting in her being fired from the production in June of that year. It looked as though her career was finished. Studios just didn\'t want to take a chance on her because it would cost them thousands of dollars in delays. She was only 36 years old.Marilyn made only 30 films in her lifetime, but her legendary status and mysticism will remain with film history forever.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Denny Jackson          Spouse (3) Arthur Miller (29 June\xa01956            - 20 January\xa01961)\xa0(divorced)           Joe DiMaggio (14 January\xa01954            - 31 October\xa01955)\xa0(divorced)           James Dougherty (19 June\xa01942            - 13 September\xa01946)\xa0(divorced)          Trade Mark (4)        Lisp, breathless voice        Platinum blonde hair        Voluptuous figure        Beauty spot on cheekTrivia (134)      Voted \'Sexiest Woman of the Century\' by People Magazine. [1999]      Was 1947\'s Miss California Artichoke Queen.      In her autobiography, ""My Story"", ghost-written by Ben Hecht, she recounted her guardian told her she was a direct descendant of James Monroe. Her mother\'s maiden name was Monroe, but there is no evidence she was a descendant of the U.S. President.      Was roommates with Shelley Winters when they were both starting out in Hollywood.      Ranked #8 in Empire (UK) magazine\'s ""The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time"" list. [October 1997]      Voted Empire\'s (UK) ""sexiest female movie star of all time"" in 1995.      She was Playboy\'s first ""Sweetheart of the Month"" in December 1953.      When she died in 1962 at age 36, she left an estate valued at $1.6 million. In her will, Monroe bequeathed 75% of that estate to Lee Strasberg, her acting coach, and 25% to Dr. Marianne Kris, her psychoanalyst. A trust fund provided her mother, Gladys Baker Eley, with $5,000 a year. When Dr. Kris died in 1980, she passed her 25% on to the Anna Freud Centre, a children\'s psychiatric institute in London. Since Strasberg\'s death in 1982, his 75% has been administered by his widow, Anna, and her lawyer, Irving Seidman.      The licensing of Marilyn\'s name and likeness, handled world-wide by Curtis Management Group, reportedly nets the Monroe estate about $2 million a year.      Was named the Number One Sex Star of the 20th Century by Playboy magazine in 1999.      Started using the name Marilyn Monroe in 1946, but did not legally change it until 1956.      Appeared on the first cover of Playboy in 1953.      Given a dog she named Tippy by foster father Albert Bolender. In her final, unfinished film Something\'s Got to Give (1962), the dog was also named Tippy.      Interred at Westwood Memorial Park, Los Angeles, California, USA, in the Corridor of Memories, crypt #24.      Hundreds of items of memorabilia auctioned off in late October 1999 by Christie\'s, with her infamous \'JFK\' birthday-gown fetching over $1 million.      Chosen by Empire magazine as one of the 100 Sexiest Stars in film history (#2). [1995]Hugh M. Hefner owns the closest burial vault next to hers.      She was discovered dead at her home at 12305 Fifth Helena Drive, Brentwood, California. She had a phone in one of her hands, her body was completely nude and face down, on her bed.      Ex-husband Joe DiMaggio put fresh roses at her memorial site, for numerous years after her death.      When putting her imprints at Grauman\'s she joked that Jane Russell was best known for her large front-side and she was known for her wiggly walk, so Jane could lean over, and she could sit in it. It was only a joke, but she dotted the ""I"" in her name with a rhinestone, which was stolen within days.      Redheaded actress Tina Louise played the character role of Ginger Grant on the television series Gilligan\'s Island (1964), was loosely based on her personality, but a different hair color.      Her first modeling job paid only five dollars.      Frequently used Nivea moisturizer.      During the filming of Niagara (1953), she was still under contract as a stock actor, thus, she received less salary than her make-up man. This was also the only film in which her character died. The film was reworked to highlight her after Anne Bancroft withdrew.      Often carried around the book, ""The Biography of Abraham Lincoln.""      Was an outstanding player on the Hollygrove Orphanage softball team.      Because the bathing suit she wore in the movie Love Nest (1951) was so risque (for the time period) and caused such a commotion on the set, director Joseph M. Newman had to make it a closed set when she was filming.      Fearing blemishes and sweat, she washed her face fifteen times a day.      She was suggested as a possible wife for Prince Rainier of Monaco. But he picked actress, Grace Kelly, to be his wife.      Thought the right side of her face was her ""best"" side.      The first time she signed an autograph as Marilyn Monroe, she had to ask how to spell it. She didn\'t know where to put the ""i"" in ""Marilyn"".      Born on Tuesday at 9:30 AM, Pacific Standard Time, which is Los Angeles, California\'s time zone.      Suffered from endometriosis, a condition in which tissues of the uterus lining (endometrium) leave the uterus, attach themselves to other areas of the body, and grow, causing pain, irregular bleeding, and, in severe cases, infertility.      Divorced first husband, James Dougherty, in Las Vegas, Nevada.      Divorced last husband, Arthur Miller, in Juarez, Mexico.      Wore glasses.      On Thursday, February 23rd, 1956, she obtained order from the City Court of the State of New York to legally change her name from Norma Jeane Mortenson to Marilyn Monroe.      Married Arthur Miller twice: the 1st time in a civil ceremony, then in a Jewish (to which she had converted) ceremony two days later.      Won an interlocutory decree from Joe DiMaggio on Wednesday, October 27th, 1954, but, under California law, the divorce was not finalized until exactly one year later.      Offered to convert to Catholism in order to marry Joe DiMaggio in a Church ceremony, but she was turned down because she was divorced. Subsequently, when the divorced DiMaggio married Marilyn in a civil ceremony at San Francisco City Hall, he was automatically excommunicated by the Church; this edict was struck down by Pope John XXIII\'s Ecumenical Council (Vatican II) in 1962.      Although it\'s believed that her mother, Gladys Baker, named her after Norma Talmadge, Gladys reportedly told her daughter, Bernice (Marilyn\'s half-sister), that she named Marilyn after Norma Jeane Cohen, a child she was Nanny to while living in Louisville, KY. while her son Robert Kermit Baker (Marilyn\'s half brother) was in Hospital, and estranged from the father Jasper Baker. The boy died, and Gladys returned to California.      The first stamp released in the USPS\'s Legends of Hollywood series, issued on Friday, June 1st, 1995.      Went to Van Nuys High School (Los Angeles) in the early 1940s but never graduated.      In 1973, Elton John released a single in tribute to her entitled ""Candle in the Wind"". In 1997, it was re-recorded with updated lyrics in memory of Princess Diana, becoming the UK\'s best-selling single of all time. Def Leppard\'s single ""Photograph"" from their ""Pyromania"" album was also written about Monroe. Glenn Danzig, lead singer of the punk band The Misfits, recorded a song called ""Who Killed Marilyn?"", inspired by his belief that she had been murdered. She is mentioned in the lyrics of several other songs, including ""Celluloid Heroes"" by The Kinks, ""We Didn\'t Start the Fire"" by Billy Joel, ""Vogue"" by Madonna, ""Lady Nina"" by rock band Marillion and ""Tell Me It\'s Not True"" from the musical ""Blood Brothers"".      Her behavior on the unfinished Something\'s Got to Give (1962) dimmed her reputation in the industry, but she was still big box office at the time of her death. What a Way to Go! (1964) and The Stripper (1963) were being developed for her.      When she was told that she was not the star in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) she verbally said ""Well whatever I am, I\'m still the blonde."".      The famous nude photo of her by Tom Kelley originally appeared as anonymous on a calendar entitled ""Miss Golden Dreams."" In 1952, a blackmailer threatened to identify the model as Marilyn, but she shrewdly thwarted the scheme by announcing the fact herself. Hugh M. Hefner then bought the rights to use the photo for $500. She became ""The Sweetheart of the Month"" in the first issue of Hefner\'s magazine, Playboy. Neither Kelley or Monroe ever saw a dime of the millions the calendar made for its publisher.      Formed her own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions, with Milton H. Greene, on December 31, 1955.      Appears on sleeve of The Beatles\' ""Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band"" album.      Batman writer/artist Bob Kane used Marilyn\'s likeness as a reference when he drew Vicki Vale.      Her USO Entertainer Identification Card (#129778) listed her name as ""Norma Jeane DiMaggio"".      She was ""discovered"" by press photographers during a World War II photo shoot at the Radioplane plant in California owned by actor Reginald Denny. She was one of the plant\'s employees. She left her job and signed with Emmeline Snively\'s modeling agency.      Was referenced in the dialogue of La dolce vita (1960), in the context of dieting.      The Emily Ann Faulkner/Rita Shawn character (played by Kim Stanley) in the John Cromwell film The Goddess (1958) was based on her.      The first Playboy magazine cover, featuring her, is pictured on one of six stamps issued in a souvenir sheet, issued by Grenada & the Grenadines on Saturday, December 1st, 2003 to celebrate Playboy\'s 50th and golden anniversary.      When she wasn\'t acting, she preferred to wear nothing but a bathrobe and occasionally a bikini.      Named 2nd Greatest Movie Star of all time by Premier Magazine, behind #1 Cary Grant and before #3 Tom Cruise.      The punk band The Misfits created or picked their name from the last movie title she acted in, The Misfits (1961).      Featured on a 1.11 euro postage stamp issued by French Post Office on Saturday, November 8th, 2003.      The very popular version of ""Santa Baby"" (also found in the film, Party Monster (2003)) thought to be sung by her was instead recorded by Cynthia Basinet for Jack Nicholson as a Christmas gift.      Ten days in advance, on Saturday, May 19th, 1962, she performed for U.S. President John F. Kennedy at his 45th birthday tribute in his honor at Madison Square Garden. She sang ""Happy Birthday"". (Kennedy\'s real birthday was May 29th).      After discovering her dress was torn, at the 1950 Academy Awards, she burst into tears.      Was named #6 Actress on The American Film Institute\'s 50 Greatest Screen Legends.      The dress Marilyn Monroe wore to serenade John F. Kennedy, on May 19, 1962 at his birthday celebration was so tight, that it had to be sewn onto her. She had to sit still for approximately an hour.      In 1999, a make-up kit that she personally owned, sold for $266,500.      One of the first Los Angeles natives to become a major movie star.      Aside from her birth name of Norma Jeane Mortenson, she was baptized and mainly known throughout her life as Norma Jeane Baker. During her modeling days she was also known as Norma Jeane Dougherty (her first marriage name), and also as Jean Norman. When she signed with 20th Century-Fox, studio casting executive Ben Lyon had first chosen the name Carol Lind as her stage name, although she disliked that. Eventually she chose her mother\'s maiden name of Monroe. Three names were drawn up as possible stage names. The first was Norma Jeane Monroe, although that sounded awkward; the second was Jean Monroe, and the third was Marilyn Monroe, the latter first name being chosen by Lyon who thought Norma Jeane resembled famed stage actress Marilyn Miller. Norma Jeane liked Jean Monroe, for it preserved some of her name, but Lyon convinced her that Marilyn Monroe sounded more alliterative and so it was chosen.      She took acting lessons from Michael Chekhov.Sergei Parajanov made collages of Monroe, Charles Chaplin, Mona Lisa, and other famous personages and many were featured in Mikhail Vartanov\'s Parajanov: The Last Spring (1992).      A 1982 review into the original inquest of Marilyn\'s death, conducted on its 20-year anniversary, concluded that the actress committed suicide or accidentally overdosed, and was not murdered--rumors that were fueled by the sloppy handling of evidence, the delay in securing the scene and the disappearance of tissue samples.      The ADR stage at Twentieth Century Fox is named after her.      In 1972, actress Veronica Hamel and her husband became the new owners of Marilyn\'s Brentwood home. They hired a contractor to replace the roof and remodel the house, and the contractor discovered a sophisticated eavesdropping and telephone tapping system that covered every room in the house. The components were not commercially available in 1962, but were in the words of a retired Justice Department official, ""standard FBI issue."" This discovery lent further support to claims of conspiracy theorists that Marilyn had been under surveillance by the Kennedys and the Mafia. The new owners spent $100,000 to remove the bugging devices from the house.      Was good friends with Dorothy Dandridge and Ava Gardner when they were all young, struggling actresses in Hollywood.      When budding actresses Shelley Winters and Marilyn were roommates in the late 1940s in Hollywood, Shelley said that one day she had to step out and asked Marilyn to ""wash the lettuce"" for a salad they were to share for dinner. When Shelley got back to the apartment, (Marilyn was apparently new to the art of cooking) had the leaves of lettuce in a small tub of soapy water and was scrubbing them clean. She had not heard of the phrase before either, or did not know it\'s true meaning.      Her real father was Charles Stanley Gifford. From his side, she was descended from the founder of Rhode Island, Roger Williams, and religious leader Anne Marbury-Hutchinson, from whom she is related to Lucretia Rudolph (wife of President James A. Garfield), Grover Cleveland, William Howard Taft, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, George Bush, and George W. Bush.      In How to Marry a Millionaire (1953), her character Pola is reading a book called ""Murder By Strangulation"" on the plane. Coincidentally, this is how her character was murdered in Niagara (1953).      Friend of James Haspiel.Don\'t Bother to Knock (1952) (her 18th film) was an attempt to prove to critics that she could act successfully. Because some earlier films took numerous takes and much longer time to complete. Especially, The Seven Year Itch (1955) which took numerous extra takes, for her character role, alone.      In Italy, her films were dubbed at the beginning of her career by Miranda Bonansea. As she matured she was dubbed by the marvellous and prolific Rosetta Calavetta with immense success, particularly in Some Like It Hot (1959). Zoe Incrocci lent her voice to Monroe once: in All About Eve (1950).      Her lifelong bouts with depression and self-destruction took their toll during filming The Seven Year Itch (1955). She frequently muffed scenes and forgot her lines, leading to sometimes as many as 40 takes of a scene before a satisfactory result was produced. Her constant tardiness and behavioral problems made the budget of the film swell to $1.8 million, a high price for the time. The film still managed to make a nice profit. The classic shot of her dress blowing up around her legs as she stands over a subway grating in this film was originally shot on Manhattan\'s Lexington Avenue at 52nd St., On Wednesday, September 15th, 1954, at 1:00 a.m. Five thousand onlookers whistled and cheered through take after take as Marilyn repeatedly missed her lines. This occurred in presence of an increasingly embarrassed and angry Joe DiMaggio (her husband at the time; the nine-month-old marriage officially ended during the shooting of this film). The original footage shot on that night in New York never made it to the screen; the noise of the crowd had made it unusable. Director Billy Wilder re-shot the scene on the 20th Century-Fox lot, on a set replicating Lexington Avenue, and got a more satisfactory result. However, it took another 40 takes for Marilyn to achieve the famous scene. Amazingly, her very narrow spike heels don\'t get stuck or break in the subway grating, although this was a universal problem at the time for the countless women wearing that very popular style heel in New York City in that era. An important promotional campaign was released for this mainstream motion picture, including a 52-foot-high cutout of Marilyn (from the blowing dress scene) erected in front of Loews State Theater, in New York City\'s Times Square. The movie premiere was on June 1, 1955, which was also her 29th birthday.      Was originally set to play Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany\'s (1961), but Audrey Hepburn played the role instead.What a Way to Go! (1964) initially intended as a vehicle for her, Shirley MacLaine played Louisa May Foster instead. Producer Arthur P. Jacobs was her publicist and J. Lee Thompson was on her list of approved directors.      She resided at the Hollywood Roosevelt while she was breaking into the acting business.      Her ""Happy Birthday Mr. President"" dress sold for $1,267,500.00, a world record for the most expensive piece of clothing ever sold, and is in the Guinness Book of World Records.      She left Hollywood to pursue serious acting by studying under Lee Strasberg at his Actors\' Studio in New York City.      Her classic shape, according to her dressmaker, is actually measured at 37-23-36.      In 1946, she signed her first studio contract with 20th Century Fox and dyed her hair.      Spent most of her early childhood in foster homes and orphanages because her mother was committed to a mental institution. Later, she lived with her mother\'s best friend, Grace McKee, and her family. McKee, a big fan of Jean Harlow, allowed her to wear make-up and curl her hair and, when she was 15, it was McKee who pierced her ears for her using a sewing needle. At 16, when McKee could no longer take care of her, she got married to avoid returning to the orphanage.      Producer Keya Morgan owns her Bible.      When she married Joe DiMaggio, the couple moved into a home at 508 N. Palm Drive in Beverly Hills, that was next door to Jean Harlow\'s last home.      She tried 9 different shades of blonde hair color before settling on platinum blonde.      Her personal library contained over 400 books on topics ranging from art to history, psychology, philosophy, literature, religion, poetry, and gardening. Many of the volumes, auctioned in 1999, bore her pencil notations in the margins.      There are over 600 books written about her.      Nearly 11 years after her death, she appeared on the cover of the Tuesday, July 17th, 1973 edition of ""Time Magazine"" in a full-color portrait taken by Bert Stern, from the last photographic sitting before her death. The cover-story heralds the publication of ""Marilyn,"" the biography of her by Norman Mailer. On the cover, her image dwarfs a black & white photo of Mailer. Mailer reportedly was displeased that ""Time"" chose to play up Monroe and diminish him, visually on the cover. The publication of the coffee table biography, which contained many photographs including several by Stern, was a major event of that publishing season. The book retailed for $19.95, which is approximately $100 in 2008 money, when factored for inflation.      ""Time Magazine"" reported in 1973 that Los Angeles County coroner Thomas Noguchi, the doctor who performed Monroe\'s autopsy, said that contrary to rumors, Monroe\'s stomach was never pumped after her death. The level of Nembutal in her bloodstream was 4.5 milligrams per 100, which is the equivalent of 40 or 50 capsules indicating suicide.      In 1961, after her divorce from Arthur Miller, she purchased a 2900 square foot hacienda style house in Brentwood, for $77,500.      Featured in ""Femme Noir: Bad Girls of Film"" by Karen Burroughs Hannsberry (McFarland, 1998).      Her last film Something\'s Got to Give (1962), was finally released in 2003. In the swimming pool scene, Marilyn reveals much more to the camera than she did in her then controversial calendar photo from the early 1950s.      Was in consideration for the part of Adelaide in Guys and Dolls (1955), but Vivian Blaine was cast instead.      Although she was perhaps the most famous actress of the 1950s decade, she never made more than $100,000 per picture upfront. Actresses such as Elizabeth Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck were earning significantly more.      Former stepmother of Robert A. Miller.      Half-sister of Berniece and Robert Kermitt Baker (but she never knew him, because he died at 14) by her mother\'s side. Sister-in-law of Paris Miracle, aunt of Mona Rae Miracle.      Became pregnant twice (in July 1957 and November 1958) during her marriage to Arthur Miller; on both occasions she suffered miscarriages.      Although she was an avid buyer of books and owned over 400 of them at her death, third husband Arthur Miller said, ""Aside from Colette\'s Cheri and a few short stories, I had never known her to read anything all the way through. She felt she could get the idea of a book, and often did, in just a few pages."".      Read and wrote poetry.      Ranked #3 in Men\'s Health 100 Hottest Women of all Time (2011).      Was a lifelong liberal Democrat.      Was close friends with singer Ella Fitzgerald and helped her rise in her musical career by arranging for her to sing in many upscale nightclubs some of which were segregated during the time of their friendship.      Monroe was a stutterer, a little known fact that was easily covered thanks to studio vocal coaches who provided her with diction lessons.      Learned to play the guitar for her role in River of No Return (1954) and the ukulele for her role in Some Like It Hot (1959).      Former sister-in-law of Joan Copeland, Vince DiMaggio, and Dominic DiMaggio. She and Joan shared the same birthday (June 1).      Film editor Dann Cahn recommended a young woman he was dating for the part of a beautiful young woman in Your Show Time (1949). Producer Stanley Rubin auditioned her and turned her down because she did not have enough experience. The young woman\'s name was Marilyn Monroe.      She was scheduled for The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955), but she was thought too old at 30 when the character was supposed to be 17 so she was replaced with Joan Collins.      According to Adam Curtis\' ""The Century of Self"", Monroe was in the later years subjected to an experimental kind of therapy where she was forced to attend the rituals of an average family and then expected to model her self upon the experience. Arthur Miller commented in the same documentary ""I don\'t think suffering is always a mistake"".Ayn Rand wrote a powerful tribute to her, compiled in ""The Voice of Reason"".      Although Monroe\'s famous nude calender grossed $750,000, the actress only got $50 and a bad cold out of it.      After working with Monroe in As Young as You Feel (1951) jealous co-star Constance Bennett wisecracked, ""Now there\'s a broad with a future behind her!"".      Among roles that Monroe turned down under her Fox contract: ""Pink Tights,"" ""How To Be Very, Very Popular,"" ""The Revolt of Mamie Stover,"" ""The Girl in the Red velvet Swing,\' ""The Jean Harlow Story,"" ""The Blue Angel,"" and ""Can-Can."".      She campaigned to play the Maria Schell role in ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" but she was never seriously considered.      According to the book ""Flesh and Fantasy"" Monroe perfected a Vaseline-based lip gloss.      ""Goodbye, Charlie"" with Debbie Reynolds, and ""The Stripper"" with Joanne Woodward were originally slated by Fox as Monroe projects.      Director Billy Wilder was quoted as saying, ""The great success of Monroe... was that she did not infuriate the female."".      Was good friends with Judy Garland.      Played by Mary Hanson in Hollywood Mouth 2 (2014). The director of that film, Jordan Mohr, had portrayed Marilyn\'s rival Simone Signoret in the stage play ""Two Simones: de Beauvoir and Signoret in Hollywood"".      Richard Widmark on co-starring with Monroe in ""Don\'t Bother to Knock"": ""She was a vulnerable kid. Murder to work with because she was scared to death of acting - even when she became a big movie actress. We had a hell of a time getting her out of the dressing room. When it was five o\'clock , it got irritating: \'C\'mon, Marilyn, we want to go home!\' She was a movie animal. Something happened between the lens and the film. Nobody knew what the hell it was. On the set, you\'d think: \'Oh, this is impossible; you can\'t print this.\' You\'d see it, and she\'s got everyone backed off the screen. Olivier said the same thing. She had that phenomenal something! Nobody knows what it is, but she had it. She certainly was never a professional actress. She always had a coach with her, lurking in the background, giving her signals. And she could never remember three words in a row - so it was all piece-work. Beyond all the technical deficiencies, she was a nice girl. We got along fine."".      Is one of 20 actresses who did not receive an Oscar nomination for their Best Actress in a Comedy/Musical Golden Globe-winning performance; hers being for Some Like It Hot (1959). The others, in chronological order, are: June Allyson for Too Young to Kiss (1951), Ethel Merman for Call Me Madam (1953), Jean Simmons for Guys and Dolls (1955), Taina Elg and Kay Kendall for Les Girls (1957), Rosalind Russell for A Majority of One (1961) and Gypsy (1962), Patty Duke for Me, Natalie (1969), Twiggy for The Boy Friend (1971), Raquel Welch for The Three Musketeers (1973), Barbra Streisand for A Star Is Born (1976), Bernadette Peters for Pennies from Heaven (1981), Kathleen Turner for Romancing the Stone (1984) and Prizzi\'s Honor (1985), Miranda Richardson for Enchanted April (1991), Jamie Lee Curtis for True Lies (1994), Nicole Kidman for To Die For (1995), Madonna for Evita (1996), Renée Zellweger for Nurse Betty (2000), Sally Hawkins for Happy-Go-Lucky (2008), and Amy Adams for Big Eyes (2014).      Egypt banned all her films after her conversion to Judaism in 1956.      One of Hajime Sorayama\'s ""Gynoids"" is based on her iconic pose from ""The Seven Year Itch"".      In order to fall asleep quicker and stay asleep longer she often mixed champagne with sleeping pills.      Became friends with Exotic Animal Trainer Ralph Helfer while working together in the movie River of No Return (1954) and got very attached to his Raccoon named Bandit.      In November 2016, the dress worn by Monroe while singing ""Happy Birthday"" to President John F. Kennedy at his 1962 birthday celebration was sold for $4.8 million, a record amount for a dress sold at auction. This surpassed the previous record for a dress sold at auction, which was also held by a dress worn by Monroe: the white dress she wore in The Seven Year Itch (1955) fetched $4.6 million in 2011.      Marilyn Monroe was 36 when she was found dead in her Beverly Hills-West Hollywood home on an early Sunday morning, August 5, 1962, just less than two and a half months after she appeared at New York City\'s Madison Square Garden, on a Saturday evening, May 19, 1962. The event was staged and produced by Broadway composer and lyricist Richard Adler. It was choreographed by Carol Haney of ""The Pajama Game"" fame. The Democratic event rally was a fund raising gala for the Democratic Party, the evening\'s program highlight, a celebration of John F. Kennedy\'s forty-fifth birthday, ten days before his actual birth-date on Tuesday, May 29, 1962, before 15,000 invited guests, Marilyn Monroe to sing ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President"" to President John F. Kennedy. Monroe sang the traditional ""Happy Birthday to You"" lyrics in a sultry, intimate voice, with ""Mr. President"" inserted as Kennedy\'s name. She continued the song with a snippet from the classic song, ""Thanks for the Memory"", for which she had written new lyrics specifically aimed at Kennedy. ""Thanks, Mr. President, For all the things you\'ve done, The battles that you\'ve won, The way you deal with U.S. Steel, And our problems by the ton, We thank you so much."" That moment in New York City, as we look back on it today in a grainy video, is frozen in time with all its possibilities still before it. We see celebration, joy, life. And we know too much about the future. Maybe that\'s why the gown Marilyn wore is worth $4.8 million. Because people will line up to see it, to stand next to something that once sparkled in the presence of greatness, of triumph, of happiness. The gown that broke the November 2016 auction record, was a creation of Hollywood film costume designer Jean Louis, with the original sketch executed by 19 year old costume illustrator Bob Mackie. Made of sheer silk marquisette-gauze fabric, the flesh-colored gown was hand-sewn with over 2,500 rhinestone-crystals, originally cost $1,440.33. It was tailored by an atelier so close to the body that Monroe was sewn into it before she walked onto the stage. The dress sold in 1999 at an auction in New York for over US $1.26 million. A new bidder subsequently purchased the dress in November 17, 2016. Peter Lawford was at the event that night to introduce Monroe. He made a play on the actress\'s reputation for tardiness by giving her a number of introductions throughout the night, building anticipation, after which she did not appear on stage. When Monroe finally appeared in a spotlight, Lawford introduced her as the ""late Marilyn Monroe"". Monroe peeled off her white ermine fur coat, revealing the dress, and the audience gasped. The film video of the event when actor Peter Lawford includes the downright eerie introduction of Monroe\'s missed cue for her entrance. ""Mr. President,"" Lawford says, leaning into the microphone, ""the LATE Marilyn Monroe."" As Lawford takes her white ermine coat, a thousand voices in the audience let out a gasp of ""Oh!"" at the sight of the gown, and the woman underneath it. According to Los Angeles\' Julien\'s Auctions, Marilyn was the only thing underneath the sheer gown, the dress was so tight that Monroe wore nothing else. Rumors of an affair between the president and the film star were sparked by the absence of Jacqueline Kennedy from the 45th birthday celebration, and by the sultry and suggestive performance. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who rarely attended Democratic Party events, spent the day at the Loudon Hunt Horse Show with her children John-John and Caroline. ""I can now retire from politics after having had \'Happy Birthday\' sung to me in such a sweet, wholesome manner,"" alluding to Marilyn\'s delivery, skintight dress, and image as a sex symbol, JFK said, when he stood alone at the lectern a few minutes later. Monroe had been spirited away from the microphone while the cameras were distracted by the entrance of an enormous birthday cake carried in on the shoulders of two men in chefs\' jackets. The November, 2016, buyer Ripley\'s Entertainment Inc., the company that operates ""Ripley\'s Believe It or Not! Museum"" in Hollywood, California, paid $4.8 million at auction. The company plans to display the dress there and also take it on tour. In 2017, Ripley\'s is celebrating its 100th year anniversary, and the ""Marilyn Monroe\'s \'Happy Birthday, Mr. President\' gown"" will be prominently featured, as it should be. Surviving to 100 and still overspending on dresses is something to celebrate. JFK was assassinated at age 46, eighteen months later after his Madison Square Garden 45th ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President"" birthday celebration, at 12:30pm Central Time, on a Friday noon motorcade parade, November 22, 1963, in Dealy Plaza in Dallas, Texas.      Subject of song ""Marilyn Monroe"" by Phoebe Legere.      Born on the same day as Andy Griffith.Personal Quotes (116)      I love a natural look in pictures. I like people with a feeling one way or another - it shows an inner life. I like to see that there\'s something going on inside them.      My problem is that I drive myself... I\'m trying to become an artist, and to be true, and sometimes I feel I\'m on the verge of craziness, I\'m just trying to get the truest part of myself out, and it\'s very hard. There are times when I think, \'All I have to be is true\'. But sometimes it doesn\'t come out so easily. I always have this secret feeling that I\'m really a fake or something, a phony.      [on living with the Bolenders when she was a little girl] They were terribly strict. They didn\'t mean any harm . . . it was their religion. They brought me up harshly.      [on meeting Joe DiMaggio for the first time] I was surprised to be so crazy about Joe. I expected a flashy New York sports type, and instead I met this reserved guy who didn\'t make a pass at me right away! He treated me like something special. Joe is a very decent man, and he makes other people feel decent, too.      [on why Joe DiMaggio didn\'t accompany her on one of her USO tours] Joe hates crowds and glamor.      [on why she divorced James Dougherty] My marriage didn\'t make me sad, but it didn\'t make me happy either. My husband and I hardly spoke to each other. This wasn\'t because we were angry. We had nothing to say. I was dying of boredom.      [on why her marriage to Joe DiMaggio didn\'t work] I didn\'t want to give up my career, and that\'s what Joe wanted me to do most of all.      I want to be a big star more than anything. It\'s something precious.      [on her favorite actress] Jean Harlow was my idol.      [on drifting in and out of orphanages when she was little] The world around me then was kind of grim. I had to learn to pretend in order to - I don\'t know - block the grimness. The whole world seemed sort of closed to me . . . [I felt] on the outside of everything, and all I could do was to dream up any kind of pretend game.      [on her early marriage to James Dougherty] Grace McKee arranged the marriage for me, I never had a choice. There\'s not much to say about it. They couldn\'t support me, and they had to work out something. And so I got married.      I\'m not interested in money, I just want to be wonderful.      A career is wonderful, but you can\'t curl up with it on a cold night.      Sometimes I think it would be easier to avoid old age, to die, young, but then you\'d never complete your life, would you? You\'d never wholly know yourself...      A dollar for your thoughts...      I\'ve been on a calendar, but never on time.      No one ever told me I was pretty when I was a little girl. All little girls should be told they\'re pretty, even if they aren\'t.      In Hollywood a girl\'s virtue is much less important than her hairdo. You\'re judged by how you look, not by what you are. Hollywood\'s a place where they\'ll pay you a thousand dollars for kiss, and fifty cents for your soul. I know, because I turned down the first offer often enough and held out for the fifty.      Dogs never bite me. Just humans.      Sex is a part of nature. I go along with nature.      Fame will go by and, so long, I\'ve had you, Fame. If it goes by, I\'ve always known it was fickle.      I knew I belonged to the public and to the world, not because I was talented or even beautiful, but because I never had belonged to anything or anyone else.      People had a habit of looking at me as if I were some kind of mirror instead of a person. They didn\'t see me, they saw their own lewd thoughts, then they white-masked themselves by calling me the lewd one.      A sex-symbol becomes a thing, I just hate being a thing. But if I\'m going to be a symbol of something I\'d rather have it sex than some other things we\'ve got symbols of.      The truth is I\'ve never fooled anyone. I\'ve let people fool themselves. They didn\'t bother to find out who and what I was. Instead they would invent a character for me. I wouldn\'t argue with them. They were obviously loving somebody I wasn\'t. When they found this out, they would blame me for disillusioning them---and fooling them.      To put it bluntly, I seem to have a whole superstructure with no foundation. But I\'m working on the foundation.      If I had observed all the rules, I\'d never have gotten anywhere.      I want to grow old without face-lifts... I want to have the courage to be loyal to the face that I have made.      It\'s often just enough to be with someone. I don\'t need to touch them. Not even talk. A feeling passes between you both. You\'re not alone.      I\'m a failure as a woman. My men expect so much of me, because of the image they\'ve made of me and that I\'ve made of myself, as a sex symbol. Men expect so much, and I can\'t live up to it.      It stirs up envy, fame does. People you run into feel that, well, who does she think she is, Marilyn Monroe? They feel fame gives them some kind of privilege to walk up to you and say anything to you, you know, of any kind of nature - and it won\'t hurt your feelings.      Fame is fickle, and I know it. It has it\'s compensations but it also has it\'s drawbacks, and I\'ve experienced them both.      My illusions didn\'t have anything to do with being a fine actress. I knew how third rate I was. I could actually feel my lack of talent, as if it were cheap clothes I was wearing inside. But my God, how I wanted to learn, to change, to improve!      If I play a stupid girl, and ask a stupid question, I\'ve got to follow it through. What am I supposed to do, look intelligent?      [on her famous nude calendar pose in 1949] My sin has been no more than I have written, posing for the nude because I desperately needed 50 dollars to get my car out of hock.      An actor is supposed to be a sensitive instrument. Isaac Stern takes good care of his violin. What if everyone jumped on his violin?      There was my name up in lights. I said, ""God, somebody\'s made a mistake!"" But there it was in lights. And I sat there and said, ""Remember, you\'re not a star"". Yet there it was up in lights.      Some people have been unkind. If I say I want to grow as an actress, they look at my figure. If I say I want to develop, to learn my craft, they laugh. Somehow they don\'t expect me to be serious about my work.      I was never used to being happy, so that wasn\'t something I ever took for granted. I did sort of think, you know, marriage did that. You see, I was brought up differently from the average American child because the average child is brought up expecting to be happy - that\'s it, successful, happy, and on time.      You know, when you grow up you can get kind of sour, I mean, that\'s the way it can go.      Wouldn\'t it be nice to be like men and get notches in your belt and sleep with most attractive men and not get emotionally involved?      I used to think as I looked at the Hollywood night, ""There must be thousands of girls sitting alone like me, dreaming of becoming a movie star. But I\'m not going to worry about them. I\'m dreaming the hardest.""      The trouble with censors is they worry if a girl has cleavage. They ought to worry if she hasn\'t any.      I used to say to myself, ""What the devil have you got to be proud about, Marilyn Monroe?"" And I\'d answer, ""Everything, everything"".      [on stardom] It scares me. All those people I don\'t know, sometimes they\'re so emotional. I mean, if they love you that much without knowing you, they can also hate you the same way.      [Johann Wolfgang von Goethe] said, ""Talent is developed in privacy"", you know? And it\'s really true. There is a need for aloneness which I don\'t think most people realize for an actor. It\'s almost having certain kinds of secrets for yourself that you\'ll let the whole world in on only for a moment, when you\'re acting.      I want to be an artist, an actress with integrity.      I\'ve never dropped anyone I believed in.      [on John F. Kennedy] It would be so nice to have a president who looks so young and good-looking.      I restore myself when I\'m alone. A career is born in public -- talent in private.      Talent is developed in privacy... but everybody is always tugging at you. They\'d all like sort of a chunk at you. They\'d kind of like to take pieces out of you.      I want to be an artist... not an erotic freak. I don\'t want to be sold to the public as a celluloid aphrodisiacal.      [about Montgomery Clift] He\'s the only person I know that is in worse shape than I am.      I\'ve never liked the name Marilyn. I\'ve often wished that I had held out that day for Jean Monroe. But I guess it\'s too late to do anything about it now.      [on Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift] Marlon\'s kinda hard to tie down, they say. He\'s never sure what he wants to do. He and Monty Clift have a lot in common, though they\'re totally different people, but they don\'t plan their careers too well and they\'re not ambitious enough for their talents.      Personally, I react to Marlon Brando. He\'s a favorite of mine.      [on Frank Sinatra] He is a man at the top of his profession and is a fine actor as well. You know, he got an Oscar for From Here to Eternity (1953). He has helped more people anonymously than anybody else. And the miserable press smears him with lies about his being involved with the Mafia and gangsters. And Frank just takes it.      [on Mae West] A nice lady even though she turned down making a picture with me. That just shows how smart she is.      Speaking of Oscars, I would win overwhelmingly if the Academy gave an Oscar for faking orgasms. I have done some of my best acting convincing my partners I was in the throes of ecstasy.      [on Laurence Olivier on the set of The Prince and the Showgirl (1957)] Olivier came into my dressing room to give me hell for screwing up. I soothed him by telling him I thought his Hamlet (1948) was one of the greatest films ever made. You know he won an Oscar for it.      When Clark Gable died, I cried for 2 days straight. I couldn\'t eat or sleep.      [on Sigmund Freud] I read his ""Introductory Lectures,"" God, what a genius. He makes it so understandable. And he is so right. Didn\'t he say himself that [William Shakespeare] and [Fyodor Dostoevsky] had a better understanding of psychology than all the scientists put together? Damn it, they do.      [on James Joyce and the character of Molly Bloom in Ulysses] Here is Joyce writing what a woman thinks to herself. Can he, does he really know her innermost thoughts? But after I read the whole book, I could better understand that Joyce is an artist who could penetrate the souls of people, male or female. It really doesn\'t matter that Joyce doesn\'t have...or never felt a menstrual cramp. To me Leopold Bloom is a central character. He is the despised Irish Jew, married to an Irish Catholic woman. It is through them Joyce develops much of what he wants to say. Do you agree that the scene where Bloom is looking at the little girl on the swing is the most erotic in the book?      [on John F. Kennedy] When he has finished his achievements, he will take his place with Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and [Franklin D. Roosevelt] as one of our greatest Presidents. I\'m glad he has [Robert F. Kennedy]. It\'s like the Navy. The President is the Captain and Bobby is his Executive Officer. Bobby would do absolutely anything for his brother. And so would I. I\'ll never embarrass him. As long as I have memory, I have John Fitzgerald Kennedy.      [on Sunday being the loneliest day of the week for her] All the men I know are spending the day with their wives and families, and all the stores in Los Angeles are closed. You can\'t wander through looking at all the pretty clothes and pretending to buy something.      [on Marlon Brando] He\'s very sweet and tender, not at all the Stanley Kowalski rapist people think he is.Arthur Miller wouldn\'t have married me if I had been nothing but a dumb blonde.      I have always been deeply terrified to really be someone\'s wife since I know from life one cannot love another, ever, really.      [on Peter Lawford] I have a need to be frightened and nothing really in my personal relationships and dealings lately have been frightening me, except for him. I felt very uneasy at different times with him, the real reason I was afraid of him is because I believe him to be homosexual...Peter wants to be a woman and would like to be me, I think.      Hollywood is a place where they\'ll pay you $50,000 for a kiss and 50c for your soul.      It\'s better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone.      It was the creative part that kept me going, trying to be an actress. I enjoy acting when you really hit it right.      I did what they said and all it got me was a lot of abuse. Everyone\'s just laughing at me. I hate it. Big breasts, big ass, big deal.      [on Arthur Miller\'s script for \'The Misfits\'] Arthur did this to me. He could have written anything and he comes up with this. If that\'s what he thinks of me, well, then I\'m not for him and he\'s not for me. Arthur says it\'s his movie. I don\'t think he even wants me in it.      I won\'t be satisfied until people want to hear me sing without looking at me.      The body is meant to be seen, not all covered up.      I love to do things that censors won\'t pass.      I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they\'re right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.      I have feelings too. I am still human. All I want is to be loved, for myself and for my talent.      I knew I belonged to the public and to the world, not because I was talented or even beautiful, but because I had never belonged to anything or anyone else.      Boys think girls are like books, If the cover doesn\'t catch their eye they won\'t bother to read what\'s inside.      [on shooting the famous scene in The Seven Year Itch (1955) where wind from the subway beneath blows her skirt up] At first it was all innocent and fun, but when Billy Wilder kept shooting the scene over and over the crowd of men kept on applauding and shouting, \'More, more Marilyn - let\'s see more.\' What was supposed to be a fun scene turned into a sex scene.      I\'ve often stood silent at a party for hours listening to my movie idols turn into dull and little people.      When you\'re young and healthy you can plan on Monday to commit suicide, and by Wednesday you\'re laughing again.      Suicide is a person\'s privilege. I don\'t believe it\'s a sin or a crime, it\'s your right if you do. Though it doesn\'t get you anywhere.      The other girls rode to school in a bus. I had no nickel to pay for the ride. Rain or shine, I walked the two miles from my ""aunt\'s"" home to the school. I hated the walk, I hated the school. I had no friends. The pupils seldom talked to me and never wanted me in their games. Nobody ever walked home with me or invited me to visit their homes. This was partly because I came from the poor part of the district where all the Mexicans and Japanese lived. It was also because I couldn\'t smile at anyone.      How or why I can act - and I\'m not sure I can - is the thing for me to understand. The torture, let alone the day to day happenings - the pain one cannot explain to another.      Executives can get colds and stay home and phone in - but the actor? How dare you get a cold or a virus! I wish they had to act a comedy with a temperature and a virus infection! I\'m there to give a performance, not to be disciplined by a studio. This isn\'t supposed to be a military school, after all.      [on homosexuality] No sex is wrong if there\'s love involved.      As long as I can remember, I\'ve always loved people.      What the world really needs is a real feeling of kinship. Everybody: stars, laborers, Negroes, Jews, Arabs. We are all brothers. Please don\'t make me a joke. End the interview with what I believe.      People always ask me if I believe diamonds are a girl\'s best friend. Frankly, I don\'t.      I have favorite motion-picture stars, like everyone else. You know who mine are? My favorite is Marlon Brando. I mean, really, I believe we\'d be an interesting combination. I\'ve said that about Marlon for a long time, but we haven\'t found the right story. Can you imagine us on the big screen? I hope something happens soon. Greta Garbo, I\'ve never met her. It really bugs me when I miss one of her films on TV. Oh, if you could only get me to meet her! I\'ve also heard wonderful things about Jeanne Eagels and Laurette Taylor. And the one they called the Blond Bombshell: Jean Harlow. Kay Kendall was a great comedian. She was really talented. I would have loved working with Gerard Philipe, the handsome French star- his films I\'ve been told were a huge success in France, as were his stage plays. I was told he wanted to make films with me. Oh, what a shame we never got the opportunity. We would have made an interesting team. What a shame. He was so young to die; he was thirty-six. He had been ill and apparently died of a heart attack.      Nearly everyone I knew talked to me about God. They always warned me not to offend Him.      Drugs pull you down and shut the lid on life. Pot opens everything up. All the anxieties, the creepy crawly blues, it all just drifts away and you can slowly remember what it feels like to be alive. Even more importantly, you can take a step back from the crap that\'s flying and see what really is important, which of the many things in your life really deserves worrying about. Not much!      [why she converted to Judaism] I believe in everything a little, and if I have kids, I think they should be Jewish. Anyway, I can identify with the Jews. Everybody\'s out to get them no matter what they do.      It might be kind of a relief to be finished. It\'s sort of like you don\'t know what kind of a yard dash you\'re running, but then you\'re at the finish line and you sort of sigh - you\'ve made it! But you never have. You have to start all over again.      I think that sexuality is only attractive when it\'s natural and spontaneous.      I sleep in the nude but I pull the sheets up.      When it comes down to it, I let them think what they want. If they care enough to bother with what I do, then I\'m already better than them.      I remember when I got the part in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Jane Russell, she was the brunette in it and I was the blonde. She got $200,000 for it, and I got my $500 a week, but that to me was, you know, considerable. She, by the way, was quite wonderful to me. The only thing was I couldn\'t get a dressing room. I said, finally, I really got to this kind of level, I said, ""Look, after all, I am the blonde, and it is Gentlemen Prefer Blondes!"" Because still they always kept saying, ""Remember, you\'re not a star."" I said, ""Well, whatever I am, I am the blonde!""      Who said nights were for sleep?      We are all born sexual creatures, thank God, but it\'s a pity so many people despise and crush this natural gift.      I\'m for the individual as opposed to the corporation. The way it is the individual is the underdog, and with all the things a corporation has going for them the individual comes out banged on her head. The artist is nothing. It\'s really tragic.      People had a habit of looking at me like I was some kind of mirror instead of a person. They didn\'t see me, they saw their own lewd thoughts, then they white-masked themselves by calling me the lewd one.      For the first family I lived with, to go to a movie was a sin. Every night I was told to pray that I would not wake up in hell.      There is nothing positive about being fat. And there is nothing positive about loving yourself. We all need to conform to society\'s expectations of who we are and if we don\'t, who will? Life is more enjoyable when you are thin and pretty. I was never fat a day in my life and I never will.      Creativity has got to start with humanity and when you\'re a human being, you feel, you suffer.      Fame is like caviar. It\'s good to have caviar, but not every damned day!      Let yourself go, the pleasure of physical movement is so important. If that\'s a problem, you say to yourself, what is there that I am afraid of, or hiding? Maybe your libido!      I have always felt comfortable in blue jeans. I have found it interesting, however, that people also whistle at blue jeans. I have to admit that I like mine to fit. There\'s nothing I hate worse than baggy blue jeans.      I want the world to see my body.      Men who think that a woman\'s past love affairs lessen her love for them are stupid. A woman can bring a new love to each man that she loves, providing that there are not too many.      The public doesn\'t mind people living together without being married, providing they don\'t overdo it.      Imperfection is beauty, madness is genius, it\'s better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring.      To everyone who thinks they\'re ugly because they\'re not a size 0, you\'re the beautiful one and it\'s society that\'s ugly.Salary (19)The Shocking Miss Pilgrim\xa0(1947)      $75 /week      Dangerous Years\xa0(1947)      $75 /week      Scudda Hoo!

Buoyed by the tremendous energy of Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers, MONKEY
BUSINESS is a charming throwback to the screwball era of the 1930s and
40s.
You know that you're being asked to leave reality behind and just settle
back for a good laugh the second the film begins, especially when the
narrator repeatedly warns Cary from beginning the film before the credits
are done rolling! Directed with great skill by Howard Hawks (mastermind of
brilliant films such as 'Bringing Up Baby' and 'His Girl Friday'), the
film
shares the trademark rapidfire dialogue and zany situations typical of
most
Hawksian comedies. As always, following the conversation between the
characters is more than enough to leave the viewer breathless... One
example, out of so many, is the scene in Room 304, when young!Edwina loses
her temper and the couple squabble about Hank Entwistle and she finally
locks Barnaby out of the room--to hilarious and painful
effect!<br><br>As with most screwball comedies, the premise of the film must first be
accepted, since the entire film is a logical development from the original
(zany) premise. In 'Monkey Business', Barnaby Fulton is working on the
development of some kind of youth elixir, which he is testing on
chimpanzees. Unbeknownst to him, one of his test subjects escapes his cage
and successfully concocts the potion, leaving it in the water fountain. Of
course, when Barnaby tests the potion on himself, he drinks some water to
get the bitter taste out of his mouth--and almost immediately becomes
about
20 years old mentally and physically. Before the elixir wears off, Barnaby
gets a funky new haircut, coat and car, all with his boss' sexy young
secretary (Marilyn Monroe, who else?) at his side. His wife Edwina (Ginger
Rogers) then gets in on the action, taking some of the elixir to allow
Barnaby to make scientific observations about someone else's reaction to
it.
It isn't long before she drags her husband to their honeymoon hotel,
dances
the night away, and impetuously starts divorce proceedings when he upsets
her. The ending is a terrific exercise in belief-suspension, as the
rejuvenated Barnaby and Edwina (simultaneously, this time) engage in paint
wars, hair-pulling and scalping.<br><br>The best part of the film really would have to be the central performance
given by Cary Grant as Barnaby Fulton. He's evidently one of Hawks's
favourite actors, and for good reason too--he makes the trippiest of
dialogue sound perfectly natural, and plays science-geeks and debonair
reporters equally convincingly. With Barnaby, the viewer is instantly
reminded of David Huxley, a role Cary Grant infused with life about 15
years
ago in Bringing Up Baby. Just as David is kickstarted to life by Susan,
Barnaby is youthened by the elixir, and in both films, it's a delight to
watch the transformation take place. Initially, Grant's Barnaby is as
stuffy
as you can imagine a scientist--he's absent-minded and somewhat stern; in
effect, all 'grown-up'. But the moment the youth elixir kicks in, the
change
is miraculous yet believable. Watch in delight as Barnaby flips an
effortless cartwheel; drives like a daredevil; and conducts an entire
chorus
of children in a rousing war song. The 'joie de vivre' that Grant infuses
his character with is almost palpable.<br><br>Cary Grant is also capably matched by Ginger Rogers in their second film
together. Her ability to turn into a little girl is charming in the
extreme,
and you can see the years drop off her in her final stint as young
Edwina...
it's so evident that she's having fun as she tap-dances through the hotel,
or flips rubber bands at people, chews gum, and scribbles ""Barnaby loves
Edwina"" across the conference room chalkboard.<br><br>In general, the film itself is a little uneven: it has brilliant and
hilarious moments, but you definitely get the feeling that much of the
film
is coasting on the considerable energy and skill of its cast--a splendid
Cary Grant, a lovely Ginger Rogers, and an intriguingly young Marilyn
Monroe. You probably won't be in too much of a hurry to rewatch this film
once you've seen it the first time, but there's really no reason to put
off
your first viewing... so what are you waiting for?

This is a very good movie to watch when all you want to do is to have a good
time and some good laughs.  There isn't a minute of it that would hold up to
logical analysis, but there's barely a minute of it that isn't fun to watch.
 The story is pleasantly zany, the characters are entertaining, and the
stars were all perfectly chosen for their roles.<br><br>Hawks's opening gag with Cary Grant in the doorway sets the tone, and lets
you know right away that you can sit back and not take anything seriously
for a while.  Grant's character, a somewhat befuddled scientist who is
trying to come up with a ""youth formula"", is the kind of role he could play
in his sleep.  As Grant's wife, Ginger Rogers doesn't get much to do for a
good while, but then she has some fine comic moments later on.  Charles
Coburn is perfect as Grant's boss, and he gets a couple of the best lines in
the whole show.  And who better than Marilyn Monroe to play Coburn's
secretary?<br><br>It's an entertaining throwback to the screwball comedies of a slightly
earlier era.  ""Monkey Business"" may be no masterpiece, but it's good fun of
the pleasantly offbeat kind that is rare anymore.

Thoroughly enjoyable comedy with Cary Grant as the absent-minded professor
who's messing around looking for the fountain of youth.  Ginger Rogers gets
to dance a little without Fred Astaire plus demonstrate a wonderful comic
style as she mixes it up with Marilyn Monroe.  It's 1952 but you wouldn't
know it (except for Marilyn's presence).  Howard Hawks takes you back to the
good old days when Hollywood demonstrated total mastery of time and space
with the screwball comedy.<br><br>Along with monkeyshines and child actors, you really get a lot in this film:
 Grant and Rogers play off each other very nicely and the driving scene with
Monroe and Grant is a classic.  Adding to the hijinx is Charles Coburn, who
always dominates the screen with his easy charm.  I bet he loved chasing
after Monroe with a spray bottle. <br><br>The movie holds up well over 50 years later which makes one wonder why
Hollywood hasn't, cringe, chosen to ape the storyline for Jim Carrey or
maybe Tom Hanks, who might be looking for a comic turn these
days.<br><br>But then they remade Freaky Friday this summer, didn't they?

If you like good solid wacky comedy, this is a strong bet.  An utterly silly
movie, it makes me smile just thinking about it--I've seen it probably a
dozen times.  Cary Grant really was in a class by himself, managing to do
virtually every genre, even though he seems to have been typecast by movie
history--here he plays a hopelessly stuffy absent minded professor, after
drinking a youth serum of improbable origin, he immediately becomes a teen
ager from the early fifties.  Changing on a dime, the transformation is
hilarious. <br><br>Ginger Rogers, always really engaging, isn't give a lot to do as an adult,
but she excels when regressing into a juvenile.  <br><br>One thing--for anyone who really likes Marilyn Monroe (and who doesn't),
this is a must see.  Not because it's her best part, or because she has a
lot of screen time, it isn't and she doesn't.  But since she made this movie
really before she became famous, it's instructive: the part is just another
ditzy bombshell secretary, but something about her just jumps off the
screen.  This seems to me to be a great example of how there's an ineffable
unexplainable quality of ""screen presence"".  She manages to hold her own
with Cary Grant, not an easy task for anyone, let alone some yet to be
discovered starlet.  <br><br>Now that we're in a gross out downward spiral for comedies, this might be
the best tonic--a movie that's very silly, and very funny.

Basically this nice little comedy by Howard Hawks is based on the urban
legend that I used in the summary line: If you put a certain number of
monkeys in front of type writers, for a long period of time, eventually
you are going to get the complete works of Shakespeare, the King James
Bible, War and Peace, Little Women, etc. This urban legend is based on
probabilities, but whether it is true or not is something nobody is
really prepared to attempt (it would be too difficult to monitor and
too expensive and too long). Here the whole idea is that an overly
observant chimpanzee in a laboratory might be able to mix the elixir
that regains lost youth or zest.<br><br>Howard Hawks had directed several comedies with Cary Grant, and Grant's
Dr. Barnaby Fulton seems like a cousin of Dr. David Huxley, the hapless
paleontologist in Hawks' 1938 comedy ""Bringing Up Baby"". Huxley is a
child in handling the madcap heiress Susan who is pursuing him no
matter what. Fulton is not as helpless as that, but he does have some
similarities. He wears eyeglasses (like Huxley), and he can seem
somewhat absent minded like Huxley. Fulton has attracted the attention
of Miss Laurel (Marilyn Monroe), the secretary of Mr. Oxley (Charles
Coburn). When Fulton goes to see Oxley for a brief conference, Ms
Laurel tries to lure his attention by showing him her lovely leg -
supposedly demonstrating her new nylons using a process he's invented.
Fulton looks at her leg closely, but clinically regarding the success
of the unbreakable nylon process.*<br><br>Ginger Rogers too showed some fragments of her past screen career as
Edwina Fulton. She constantly wants to go dancing, and when she drinks
the rejuvenating formula she starts doing some nice dance steps
(reminding us of her days with Astaire, but even of her work in the
Busby Berkeley musicals of the 1930s). At one point when she has taken
too much of the formula she is suddenly 10-12 years old, and we see a
repeat of her ""Sue-Sue"" Applegate in ""The Major And The Minor"".<br><br>Grant works for a corporation headed by Coburn and Larry Keating. They
have been prospering from Grant's chemical inventions and patents, but
Coburn is particularly interested in this rejuvenation formula. It is
supposed to make a man feel decades younger and vigorous again. As
Coburn has the beautiful Monroe as a secretary with indifferent skills
(he hands her a paper to have someone else type, and when she protests
to get another chance to type it instead, he gently explains it is too
important - ""Anyone can type!"", he says to Grant) it is obvious that if
the formula works he will be using it to pursue Monroe. Coburn is so
desperate he wants to convert the entire factory to just produce the
rejuvenation formula if it succeeds.<br><br>Grant is not too happy - he's been working for two years on the formula
and there has been no success yet. He leaves the monkey cage open, and
a female chimpanzee (who has been watching Grant mix the formula)
throws the chemicals together and hides it within the water cooler. And
every time the formula that Grant makes is tried, the guinea pig
(Grant, Rogers, whoever) takes a drink of water to help make it
palatable. And, of course, it is the unknown concoction of the monkey
that actually sets off the rejuvenation.<br><br>The film follows the good and bad points of rejuvenation. Yes it does
make a person more vigorous and able to do things that he hasn't been
able to do for years (Grant does a cartwheel at one point). But it
makes the user unreasonable to others who are not similarly peppy -
Rogers thinks that Grant is a drag, as he doesn't take the concoction
when they go out back to the hotel they honeymooned in. She is ready to
jitterbug, and he's collapsing. And if too much is taken you become
emotionally immature, leading to Grant arranging the scalping of his
former rival (Hugh Marlowe) by some real kids.<br><br>The film has some nice little bits in it. An immature Grant is asked
for the ""secret ingredient"" to his formula. How much, Coburn asks him,
for the formula? ""I want a zillion dollars!"", Grant says - which he
claims is a trillion million. And when he is trying to arrange the
scalping of Marlowe, one of the youths (George Winslow) keeps bringing
him down to earth by reminding him they need a war dance if they are
going to scalp anyone!<br><br>Probably not on par with ""Bringing Up Baby"" or ""His Gal Friday"", but it
was a good comedy for all that. <br><br>*However, later on, when he's taken the rejuvenating formula, Fulton
does recognize Ms Laurel by her legs under a sign - suggesting that the
attractiveness of her legs did make an impact on him.

The movie Monkey Business could have been pretty bad. I would say that
it's saving grace is the fact that the people involved are all highly
talented. Howard Hawks turns in some excellent direction per usual,
although I'm sure he was only paying the bills. Cary Grant and Ginger
Rogers are pitch perfect. Marilyn Monroe is essentially eye candy in
this movie but she still steals every scene she is in, which
unfortunately isn't very many.<br><br>The script was written by the highly respected Ben Hecht , Charles
Lederer (of His Girl Friday fame) and I.A.L. Diamond (Some Like It Hot
etc...). With so many excellent writers involved you know the script is
going to be at least decent. Granted that a monkey discovering a potion
for the fountain of youth is a pretty silly premise they managed to
pull it off for the most part. The dialog is a bit awkward in places
but overall very good and the script certainly got it's message across.<br><br>Cary Grant's performance makes this film. He perfectly embodies what a
typical teenager and child of the age would be. Of course the scenes in
which he takes the potion are the highlights of the film and he does an
excellent job with them. He also has considerable chemistry with his
female costars particularly Ginger Rogers (Who plays his wife).<br><br>Marilyn Monroe plays Grant's bosses slightly dim but wonderfully
innocent secretary. Although she has limited screen time you cannot
take your eyes off of her anytime she is in the shot. The sign of a
great actress.<br><br>Overall a very charming film with a feel good message. 7/10

Monkey Business is a sort of late screwball comedy in which a scientist
discovers a formula for returning people to their youth. The problem is that
they become a little too youthful, and all hell breaks loose as a result.
Directed by veteran Howard Hawks, co-authored by Ben Hecht, this is a funny
if one joke film. Leading players Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers handle their
parts capably, Charles Coburn is marvelous in a large (in all senses of that
word) supporting role, and since it's a cliche to call Marilyn Monroe eye
candy, I won't. Good fun all-round, the movie is in the end not as good as
its thirties prototypes; some of the jokes go on for too long; and the
repartee, such as the dialogue can be called, isn't as zingy as it might be.
A good try, though, and intermittently hilarious.

This is a good movie featuring Cary Grant as the scientist who found a
rejuvenating formula. Follows a series a wacky adventure for professor
Fulton and his wife, played by Ginger Rogers. Top notch performances by

And let's not forget the monkeys!<br><br>7 out of 10.

I haven't seen this film for years,its very rarely on TV these
days,which is a shame,i managed to get a copy on DVD,its always been
one of the comedies I've wanted to own.The scene i always remembered
best,was the one in which Cary Grant is playing cowboys and Indian's
with the local children,and where Hank Entwhistle gets his just
deserts,for being a smug playboy still trying to get Edwina.Ginger
Rogers proved she could still dance and did a great comic turn,when she
turns into a child.This film goes to show,that in them days they could
make classic comedy without any foul language and without crudity,they
didn't find any problem doing that.Marilyn Monroe provided the sexual
interest in one of her more low key performances,and the plot only
mildly focus on that,which is good.If you have never seen this film,and
you like films from the early fifties,this is definitely worth a look.

Buoyed by the tremendous energy of Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers, MONKEY
BUSINESS is a charming throwback to the screwball era of the 1930s and
40s.
You know that you're being asked to leave reality behind and just settle
back for a good laugh the second the film begins, especially when the
narrator repeatedly warns Cary from beginning the film before the credits
are done rolling! Directed with great skill by Howard Hawks (mastermind of
brilliant films such as 'Bringing Up Baby' and 'His Girl Friday'), the
film
shares the trademark rapidfire dialogue and zany situations typical of
most
Hawksian comedies. As always, following the conversation between the
characters is more than enough to leave the viewer breathless... One
example, out of so many, is the scene in Room 304, when young!Edwina loses
her temper and the couple squabble about Hank Entwistle and she finally
locks Barnaby out of the room--to hilarious and painful
effect!<br><br>As with most screwball comedies, the premise of the film must first be
accepted, since the entire film is a logical development from the original
(zany) premise. In 'Monkey Business', Barnaby Fulton is working on the
development of some kind of youth elixir, which he is testing on
chimpanzees. Unbeknownst to him, one of his test subjects escapes his cage
and successfully concocts the potion, leaving it in the water fountain. Of
course, when Barnaby tests the potion on himself, he drinks some water to
get the bitter taste out of his mouth--and almost immediately becomes
about
20 years old mentally and physically. Before the elixir wears off, Barnaby
gets a funky new haircut, coat and car, all with his boss' sexy young
secretary (Marilyn Monroe, who else?) at his side. His wife Edwina (Ginger
Rogers) then gets in on the action, taking some of the elixir to allow
Barnaby to make scientific observations about someone else's reaction to
it.
It isn't long before she drags her husband to their honeymoon hotel,
dances
the night away, and impetuously starts divorce proceedings when he upsets
her. The ending is a terrific exercise in belief-suspension, as the
rejuvenated Barnaby and Edwina (simultaneously, this time) engage in paint
wars, hair-pulling and scalping.<br><br>The best part of the film really would have to be the central performance
given by Cary Grant as Barnaby Fulton. He's evidently one of Hawks's
favourite actors, and for good reason too--he makes the trippiest of
dialogue sound perfectly natural, and plays science-geeks and debonair
reporters equally convincingly. With Barnaby, the viewer is instantly
reminded of David Huxley, a role Cary Grant infused with life about 15
years
ago in Bringing Up Baby. Just as David is kickstarted to life by Susan,
Barnaby is youthened by the elixir, and in both films, it's a delight to
watch the transformation take place. Initially, Grant's Barnaby is as
stuffy
as you can imagine a scientist--he's absent-minded and somewhat stern; in
effect, all 'grown-up'. But the moment the youth elixir kicks in, the
change
is miraculous yet believable. Watch in delight as Barnaby flips an
effortless cartwheel; drives like a daredevil; and conducts an entire
chorus
of children in a rousing war song. The 'joie de vivre' that Grant infuses
his character with is almost palpable.<br><br>Cary Grant is also capably matched by Ginger Rogers in their second film
together. Her ability to turn into a little girl is charming in the
extreme,
and you can see the years drop off her in her final stint as young
Edwina...
it's so evident that she's having fun as she tap-dances through the hotel,
or flips rubber bands at people, chews gum, and scribbles ""Barnaby loves
Edwina"" across the conference room chalkboard.<br><br>In general, the film itself is a little uneven: it has brilliant and
hilarious moments, but you definitely get the feeling that much of the
film
is coasting on the considerable energy and skill of its cast--a splendid
Cary Grant, a lovely Ginger Rogers, and an intriguingly young Marilyn
Monroe. You probably won't be in too much of a hurry to rewatch this film
once you've seen it the first time, but there's really no reason to put
off
your first viewing... so what are you waiting for?

This is a very good movie to watch when all you want to do is to have a good
time and some good laughs.  There isn't a minute of it that would hold up to
logical analysis, but there's barely a minute of it that isn't fun to watch.
 The story is pleasantly zany, the characters are entertaining, and the
stars were all perfectly chosen for their roles.<br><br>Hawks's opening gag with Cary Grant in the doorway sets the tone, and lets
you know right away that you can sit back and not take anything seriously
for a while.  Grant's character, a somewhat befuddled scientist who is
trying to come up with a ""youth formula"", is the kind of role he could play
in his sleep.  As Grant's wife, Ginger Rogers doesn't get much to do for a
good while, but then she has some fine comic moments later on.  Charles
Coburn is perfect as Grant's boss, and he gets a couple of the best lines in
the whole show.  And who better than Marilyn Monroe to play Coburn's
secretary?<br><br>It's an entertaining throwback to the screwball comedies of a slightly
earlier era.  ""Monkey Business"" may be no masterpiece, but it's good fun of
the pleasantly offbeat kind that is rare anymore.

Thoroughly enjoyable comedy with Cary Grant as the absent-minded professor
who's messing around looking for the fountain of youth.  Ginger Rogers gets
to dance a little without Fred Astaire plus demonstrate a wonderful comic
style as she mixes it up with Marilyn Monroe.  It's 1952 but you wouldn't
know it (except for Marilyn's presence).  Howard Hawks takes you back to the
good old days when Hollywood demonstrated total mastery of time and space
with the screwball comedy.<br><br>Along with monkeyshines and child actors, you really get a lot in this film:
 Grant and Rogers play off each other very nicely and the driving scene with
Monroe and Grant is a classic.  Adding to the hijinx is Charles Coburn, who
always dominates the screen with his easy charm.  I bet he loved chasing
after Monroe with a spray bottle. <br><br>The movie holds up well over 50 years later which makes one wonder why
Hollywood hasn't, cringe, chosen to ape the storyline for Jim Carrey or
maybe Tom Hanks, who might be looking for a comic turn these
days.<br><br>But then they remade Freaky Friday this summer, didn't they?

If you like good solid wacky comedy, this is a strong bet.  An utterly silly
movie, it makes me smile just thinking about it--I've seen it probably a
dozen times.  Cary Grant really was in a class by himself, managing to do
virtually every genre, even though he seems to have been typecast by movie
history--here he plays a hopelessly stuffy absent minded professor, after
drinking a youth serum of improbable origin, he immediately becomes a teen
ager from the early fifties.  Changing on a dime, the transformation is
hilarious. <br><br>Ginger Rogers, always really engaging, isn't give a lot to do as an adult,
but she excels when regressing into a juvenile.  <br><br>One thing--for anyone who really likes Marilyn Monroe (and who doesn't),
this is a must see.  Not because it's her best part, or because she has a
lot of screen time, it isn't and she doesn't.  But since she made this movie
really before she became famous, it's instructive: the part is just another
ditzy bombshell secretary, but something about her just jumps off the
screen.  This seems to me to be a great example of how there's an ineffable
unexplainable quality of ""screen presence"".  She manages to hold her own
with Cary Grant, not an easy task for anyone, let alone some yet to be
discovered starlet.  <br><br>Now that we're in a gross out downward spiral for comedies, this might be
the best tonic--a movie that's very silly, and very funny.

Basically this nice little comedy by Howard Hawks is based on the urban
legend that I used in the summary line: If you put a certain number of
monkeys in front of type writers, for a long period of time, eventually
you are going to get the complete works of Shakespeare, the King James
Bible, War and Peace, Little Women, etc. This urban legend is based on
probabilities, but whether it is true or not is something nobody is
really prepared to attempt (it would be too difficult to monitor and
too expensive and too long). Here the whole idea is that an overly
observant chimpanzee in a laboratory might be able to mix the elixir
that regains lost youth or zest.<br><br>Howard Hawks had directed several comedies with Cary Grant, and Grant's
Dr. Barnaby Fulton seems like a cousin of Dr. David Huxley, the hapless
paleontologist in Hawks' 1938 comedy ""Bringing Up Baby"". Huxley is a
child in handling the madcap heiress Susan who is pursuing him no
matter what. Fulton is not as helpless as that, but he does have some
similarities. He wears eyeglasses (like Huxley), and he can seem
somewhat absent minded like Huxley. Fulton has attracted the attention
of Miss Laurel (Marilyn Monroe), the secretary of Mr. Oxley (Charles
Coburn). When Fulton goes to see Oxley for a brief conference, Ms
Laurel tries to lure his attention by showing him her lovely leg -
supposedly demonstrating her new nylons using a process he's invented.
Fulton looks at her leg closely, but clinically regarding the success
of the unbreakable nylon process.*<br><br>Ginger Rogers too showed some fragments of her past screen career as
Edwina Fulton. She constantly wants to go dancing, and when she drinks
the rejuvenating formula she starts doing some nice dance steps
(reminding us of her days with Astaire, but even of her work in the
Busby Berkeley musicals of the 1930s). At one point when she has taken
too much of the formula she is suddenly 10-12 years old, and we see a
repeat of her ""Sue-Sue"" Applegate in ""The Major And The Minor"".<br><br>Grant works for a corporation headed by Coburn and Larry Keating. They
have been prospering from Grant's chemical inventions and patents, but
Coburn is particularly interested in this rejuvenation formula. It is
supposed to make a man feel decades younger and vigorous again. As
Coburn has the beautiful Monroe as a secretary with indifferent skills
(he hands her a paper to have someone else type, and when she protests
to get another chance to type it instead, he gently explains it is too
important - ""Anyone can type!"", he says to Grant) it is obvious that if
the formula works he will be using it to pursue Monroe. Coburn is so
desperate he wants to convert the entire factory to just produce the
rejuvenation formula if it succeeds.<br><br>Grant is not too happy - he's been working for two years on the formula
and there has been no success yet. He leaves the monkey cage open, and
a female chimpanzee (who has been watching Grant mix the formula)
throws the chemicals together and hides it within the water cooler. And
every time the formula that Grant makes is tried, the guinea pig
(Grant, Rogers, whoever) takes a drink of water to help make it
palatable. And, of course, it is the unknown concoction of the monkey
that actually sets off the rejuvenation.<br><br>The film follows the good and bad points of rejuvenation. Yes it does
make a person more vigorous and able to do things that he hasn't been
able to do for years (Grant does a cartwheel at one point). But it
makes the user unreasonable to others who are not similarly peppy -
Rogers thinks that Grant is a drag, as he doesn't take the concoction
when they go out back to the hotel they honeymooned in. She is ready to
jitterbug, and he's collapsing. And if too much is taken you become
emotionally immature, leading to Grant arranging the scalping of his
former rival (Hugh Marlowe) by some real kids.<br><br>The film has some nice little bits in it. An immature Grant is asked
for the ""secret ingredient"" to his formula. How much, Coburn asks him,
for the formula? ""I want a zillion dollars!"", Grant says - which he
claims is a trillion million. And when he is trying to arrange the
scalping of Marlowe, one of the youths (George Winslow) keeps bringing
him down to earth by reminding him they need a war dance if they are
going to scalp anyone!<br><br>Probably not on par with ""Bringing Up Baby"" or ""His Gal Friday"", but it
was a good comedy for all that. <br><br>*However, later on, when he's taken the rejuvenating formula, Fulton
does recognize Ms Laurel by her legs under a sign - suggesting that the
attractiveness of her legs did make an impact on him.

The movie Monkey Business could have been pretty bad. I would say that
it's saving grace is the fact that the people involved are all highly
talented. Howard Hawks turns in some excellent direction per usual,
although I'm sure he was only paying the bills. Cary Grant and Ginger
Rogers are pitch perfect. Marilyn Monroe is essentially eye candy in
this movie but she still steals every scene she is in, which
unfortunately isn't very many.<br><br>The script was written by the highly respected Ben Hecht , Charles
Lederer (of His Girl Friday fame) and I.A.L. Diamond (Some Like It Hot
etc...). With so many excellent writers involved you know the script is
going to be at least decent. Granted that a monkey discovering a potion
for the fountain of youth is a pretty silly premise they managed to
pull it off for the most part. The dialog is a bit awkward in places
but overall very good and the script certainly got it's message across.<br><br>Cary Grant's performance makes this film. He perfectly embodies what a
typical teenager and child of the age would be. Of course the scenes in
which he takes the potion are the highlights of the film and he does an
excellent job with them. He also has considerable chemistry with his
female costars particularly Ginger Rogers (Who plays his wife).<br><br>Marilyn Monroe plays Grant's bosses slightly dim but wonderfully
innocent secretary. Although she has limited screen time you cannot
take your eyes off of her anytime she is in the shot. The sign of a
great actress.<br><br>Overall a very charming film with a feel good message. 7/10

Monkey Business is a sort of late screwball comedy in which a scientist
discovers a formula for returning people to their youth. The problem is that
they become a little too youthful, and all hell breaks loose as a result.
Directed by veteran Howard Hawks, co-authored by Ben Hecht, this is a funny
if one joke film. Leading players Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers handle their
parts capably, Charles Coburn is marvelous in a large (in all senses of that
word) supporting role, and since it's a cliche to call Marilyn Monroe eye
candy, I won't. Good fun all-round, the movie is in the end not as good as
its thirties prototypes; some of the jokes go on for too long; and the
repartee, such as the dialogue can be called, isn't as zingy as it might be.
A good try, though, and intermittently hilarious.

His paternal grandfather was Irish, and the rest of his family was Mexican. After starting life in extremely modest circumstances in Mexico, his family moved to Los Angeles, where he grew up in the Boyle Heights and Echo Park neighborhoods. He attended Polytechnic High School and later Belmont High, but eventually dropped out. The young Quinn boxed (which stood him in good stead as a stage actor, when he played Stanley Kowalski in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" to rave reviews in Chicago), then later studied architecture under Frank Lloyd Wright at the great architect\'s studio, Taliesin, in Arizona. Quinn was close to Wright, who encouraged him when he decided to give acting a try. After a brief apprenticeship on stage, Quinn hit Hollywood in 1936 and picked up a variety of small roles in several films at Paramount, including an Indian warrior in The Plainsman (1936), which was directed by the man who later became his father-in-law, Cecil B. DeMille.As a contract player at Paramount, Quinn mainly played villains and ethnic types, such as an Arab chieftain in the Bing Crosby-Bob Hope vehicle Road to Morocco (1942). As a Mexican national (he did not become an American citizen until 1947), he was exempt from the draft. With many actors in the service fighting World War II, Quinn was able to move up into better supporting roles. He had married DeMille\'s daughter Katherine DeMille, which afforded him entrance to the top circles of Hollywood society. He became disenchanted with his career and did not renew his Paramount contract despite the advice of others, including his father-in-law (whom Quinn felt never accepted him due to his Mexican roots). Instead, he returned to the stage to hone his craft. His portrayal of Stanley Kowalski in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" in Chicago and on Broadway (where he replaced the legendary Marlon Brando, who is forever associated with the role) made his reputation and boosted his film career when he returned to the movies.Brando and Elia Kazan, who directed ""Streetcar"" on Broadway and on film (A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)), were crucial to Quinn\'s future success. Kazan, knowing the two were potential rivals due to their acclaimed portrayals of Kowalski, cast Quinn as Brando\'s brother in his biographical film of Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, Viva Zapata! (1952). Quinn won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for 1952, making him the first Mexican-American to win an Oscar. It was not to be his lone appearance in the winner\'s circle: he won his second Supporting Actor Oscar in 1957 for his portrayal of Paul Gauguin in Vincente Minnelli\'s biographical film of Vincent van Gogh, Lust for Life (1956), opposite Kirk Douglas. Over the next decade Quinn lived in Italy and became a major figure in world cinema, as many studios shot films in Italy to take advantage of the lower costs (""runaway production"" had battered the industry since its beginnings in the New York / New Jersey area in the 1910s). He appeared in several Italian films, giving one of his greatest performances as the circus strongman who brutalizes the sweet soul played by Giulietta Masina in her husband Federico Fellini\'s masterpiece La Strada (1954).Alternating between Europe and Hollywood, Quinn built his reputation and entered the front rank of character actors and character leads. He received his third Oscar nomination (and first for Best Actor) for George Cukor\'s Wild Is the Wind (1957). He played a Greek resistance fighter against the Nazi occupation in the monster hit The Guns of Navarone (1961) and received kudos for his portrayal of a once-great boxer on his way down in Rod Serling\'s Requiem for a Heavyweight (1962). He went back to playing ethnic roles, such as an Arab warlord in David Lean\'s masterpiece Lawrence of Arabia (1962), and he played the eponymous lead in the ""sword-and-sandal"" blockbuster Barabbas (1961). Two years later, he reached the zenith of his career, playing Zorba the Greek in the film of the same name (a.k.a. Alexis Zorbas (1964)), which brought him his fourth, and last, Oscar nomination as Best Actor. The 1960s were kind to him: he played character leads in such major films as The Shoes of the Fisherman (1968) and The Secret of Santa Vittoria (1969). However, his appearance in the title role in the film adaptation of John Fowles\' novel, The Magus (1968), did nothing to save the film, which was one of that decade\'s notorious turkeys.In the 1960s, Quinn told Life magazine that he would fight against typecasting. Unfortunately, the following decade saw him slip back into playing ethnic types again, in such critical bombs as The Greek Tycoon (1978). He starred as the Hispanic mayor of a southwestern city on the short-lived television series The Man and the City (1971), but his career lost its momentum during the 1970s. Aside from playing a thinly disguised Aristotle Onassis in the cinematic roman-a-clef The Greek Tycoon (1978), his other major roles of the decade were as Hamza in the controversial The Message (1976) (a.k.a. ""Mohammad, Messenger of God""), as the Italian patriarch in L\'eredità Ferramonti (1976), yet another Arab in Caravans (1978) and a Mexican patriarch in The Children of Sanchez (1978). In 1983, he reprised his most famous role, Zorba the Greek, on Broadway in the revival of the musical ""Zorba"", for 362 performances. Though his film career slowed during the 1990s, he continued to work steadily in films and television.Quinn lived out the latter years of his life in Bristol, Rhode Island, where he spent most of his time painting and sculpting. He died in a hospital in Boston from pneumonia and respiratory failure linked to his battle with lung cancer. He was 86 years old.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Jon C.

Became a naturalized United States citizen in 1947, just before he was ""gray-listed"" for his association with Communists such as screenwriter John Howard Lawson and what were termed ""fellow travelers"", though he himself was never called before the House Un-American Activities Committee. When warned of his gray-listing by 20th Century-Fox boss Darryl F. Zanuck (a liberal), Quinn decided to go on the Broadway stage where there was no blacklist rather than go through the process of refuting the suspicions.      He had to shave his hair for The Magus (1968). He had an insurance policy against the risk that it might not grow back.      Lived in Bristol, Rhode Island, and befriended Providence\'s controversial mayor Buddy Cianci.      Before he launched his acting career, Quinn worked odd jobs as a butcher, a boxer, street corner preacher and a slaughterhouse worker. He also won a scholarship to study architecture with Frank Lloyd Wright, with whom he developed a close relationship.      Won his second Oscar for a movie in which he only appeared on screen for a total of 23 minutes and 40 seconds.      Brother-in-law of screenwriter Martin Goldsmith.      Son of an Irish-Mexican father and Mexican mother, he grew up in the barrio of East Los Angeles shining shoes and selling newspapers.      His sidelines were painting and sculpting.      Was scheduled to appear in the David Lean-directed ""Nostromo"" in 1991, but Lean died and the production came to a halt.      For extra cash, he entered dance contest, from which he sold the statues.      Was nominated for Broadway\'s 1961 Tony Award as Best Actor (Dramatic) for Becket.      Around 1972, he announced his desire to play Henry Cristophe, the 19th-century emperor of Haiti. Upon this announcement, several prominent black actors, including Ossie Davis and Ellen Holly, stated that they were opposed to a ""white man"" playing ""black"". Davis stated, ""My black children need black heroes on which to model their behavior. Henry Cristophe is an authentic black hero. Tony, for all my admiration of him as a talent, will do himself and my children a great disservice if he encourages them to believe that only a white man, and Tony is white to my children, is capable of playing a black hero."".      Took acting class from Michael Chekhov in Hollywood.      According to Joseph McBride\'s Searching for John Ford (St. Martin\'s Press, 2001 - ISBN 0312242328), director John Ford was urged to cast Richard Boone and Quinn as the Little Wolf and Dull Knife characters in Cheyenne Autumn (1964), as both allegedly had Native American blood. Ricardo Montalban and Gilbert Roland, who were of Mexican ancestry, were cast instead.      Had played in the band of evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson as a youth and as a deputy preacher.      While many biographies have the young Quinn, who was the son of an Irish father and Mexican mother, growing up on the streets of East Los Angeles, the truth was that he grew up in Echo Park, attending Polytechnic (which at the time was located in downtown Los Angeles before it moved to North Hollywood) and Belmont High Schools. In later years, he would recount how, while growing up in Echo Park, young Chicano toughs would come over to his house to enlist his help in brawling with the Irish gangs, and that later in the same day, young Irish bruisers would visit him to enlist his services in fighting the Mexicans. He would always beg off choosing sides by having his mother chase the young delinquents out of her house, after which he would resume one of his favorite pastimes, drafting and drawing.      He did not get along well with his first father-in-law, legendary producer-director Cecil B. DeMille, though they later developed a civil relationship.      Ex-father-in-law of Lauren Holly and Melissa Quinn.      He was one of the few actors to move easily and successfully between starring and supporting roles throughout his career. In both categories, the Irish-Mexican Quinn played a vast array of characters and ethnicities, including American, Arab, Basque, Chinese, English, French, Greek, Hawaiian, Hebrew, Hun, Irish, Italian, Mexican, Mongol, Native American, Filipino, Portuguese, Spaniard and Ukranian.      Donated blood to John Barrymore whenever the older actor needed a transfusion.      Underwent quadruple heart bypass surgery in February 1990.      He was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, in 1915, during the Mexican revolution, in which his father was a soldier in the army of Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa. After the revolution, the family moved to Los Angeles, California, where Quinn\'s father eventually secured a job as a cameraman at Selig Film Studios. Quinn often accompanied his father to work, and became acquainted with such stars as Tom Mix and John Barrymore, with whom he kept up the friendship into adulthood.      Was very fond of Keanu Reeves. They became friends during the filming of A Walk in the Clouds (1995).      Was good friends with actress Maureen O\'Hara, they starred together six times. The films are The Black Swan (1942), Buffalo Bill (1944), Sinbad, the Sailor (1947), Against All Flags (1952), The Magnificent Matador (1955) and Only the Lonely (1991).      Had appeared with Irene Papas in seven films starting as far back as 1954. The films are Attila (1954),The Guns of Navarone (1961), Alexis Zorbas (1964), A Dream of Kings (1969), the Mexican produced, Spanish languaged and filmed in Rome short film El asesinato de Julio César (1972), The Message (1976) and Lion of the Desert (1980).      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6251 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on February 8, 1960.      He met his second wife, Jolanda Addolori, a wardrobe assistant, while he was in Rome filming Barabbas (1961).      His father was killed in a motor accident when he was age 9.      His first job in Hollywood was tending animals at the Selig Studio.      Inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 2015.      The Manfred Mann song ""The Mighty Quinn (Quinn the Eskimo)"" was based on Anthony Quinn\'s character in ""The Savage Innocents"".Personal Quotes (20)      In Europe, an actor is an artist. In Hollywood, if he isn\'t working, he\'s a bum.      [when asked about his ethnicity] It doesn\'t make a difference as long as I\'m a person in the world.      I never get the girl. I wind up with a country instead. They said all I was good for was playing Indians.      I can\'t retire. I mean, I started working when I was a year and a half old, and I worked all my life.      [In the 1980s] I don\'t see many men today. I see a lot of guys running around on television with small waists, but I don\'t see many men.      I never satisfied that kid [referring to himself], but I think he and I have made a deal now. It\'s like climbing a mountain. I didn\'t take him up Mount Everest, but I took him up Mount Whitney. And I think that\'s not bad.      I have lived in a flurry of images, but I will go out in a freeze frame.      [on Ingrid Bergman] I reckon there wasn\'t a man who came within a mile of her who didn\'t fall in love with her.      [on Marlon Brando] I admire Marlon\'s talent, but I don\'t envy the pain that created it.      [on Marilyn Monroe] An empty-headed blonde with a fat rear. Oh, Monroe was pretty enough to look at, but there were hundreds of better-looking actresses poking around Hollywood. Even after she hit the big time, with Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), I never could see what all the fuss was about.      [on Alexis Zorbas (1964)] Nobody wanted to do this role. Burl Ives and Burt Lancaster turned it down. They said ""Who cares about an old man making love to a broken-down old broad?"".      [In 1962] Ten years ago, there wasn\'t an actor who didn\'t envy Brando. He was superb. His potential was enormous. But what happened? He went out to Hollywood, and instead of fighting giants, he fought pygmies. He stopped growing. He threw his potential away.      [on Spencer Tracy] Spencer Tracy\'s a dangerous actor. You never know what he\'s going to do. He\'s one of the few actors you can never steal a scene from. He and Olivier and Jean Gabin.      When I was just starting in movies, I got a reputation for being a scene stealer. Once I was in a film with a famous star and had to stand behind him in one scene. ""Now watch that Quinn,"" this star told the director, ""I don\'t want him stealing the scene behind my back."" The director parked me in a chair and I just sat there. Next day, when we were looking at the rushes, the star said ""See, I told you! Look at him!"" The director exclaimed: ""But he\'s only sitting there!"" ""Only,"" rejoined the star, ""Maybe so, but he\'s thinking!"".      [on Marlon Brando] We forget how he revolutionized acting. Look at the chances he takes - think of all the stars who drift along playing themselves.      [In 1996] The painter leaves his mark. And I just put in two statues in Rhode Island that I\'m working on. And I think that\'s going to make me last longer than me. I mean, who remembers ""Zorba""? Nobody remembers ""Zorba"". Nobody remembers ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"".      One of the reasons I did all the Greeks and Arab parts I did was because I was trying to identify myself as a man of the world. I lived in Greece, in France, Iran and all over the world, Spain, trying to find a niche where I would finally be accepted.      My mother and father were both young kids fighting in the revolution, and we always lived a Mexican life, even when we moved to Texas. But to be Mexicans with the name of Quinn, that was not a nice thing to do. If your name isn\'t Gonzalez or Montoya or whatever, they just don\'t acknowledge you as a Mexican.      I think I\'m lucky. I was born with very little talent but great drive.      I am of the opinion - and I\'m not afraid to say it - that men are slightly lost today. They don\'t know where in the hell they are with this women\'s liberation. A man is responsibility. I think that\'s what I represent: responsibility.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nJackie Gleason ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 61 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(5)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(3)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(35)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(7)\xa0|Salary\xa0(10)  Overview (5)Date of Birth26\xa0February1916,\xa0Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA Date of Death24\xa0June1987,\xa0Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA      \xa0(colon and liver cancer)    Birth NameHerbert Walton Gleason Jr.Nicknames""The Great One""""The Abdominal Showman""""Mr. Miami Beach""    Height5\'\xa09½""\xa0(1.77\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Comedian, actor, composer and conductor, educated in New York public schools.

The precious wood interior took special crafting by Swedish carpenters who were brought to the U.S. for a year to work on the house. It contained a basement disco and one of the very first in-home video projection systems. Despite the enormous cost, the Gleason dream house long suffered from a leaky wooden roof.      He was legendary for his dislike of rehearsal, even in the early days of live TV. Yet he was equally renowned for his total mastery and control over each production detail and insisted on the show credit: ""Entire Production Supervised by Jackie Gleason.""      Prone to excess with wine, women, song and work, a lifestyle which often led to exhaustion. In such cases, he would check into a hospital for some needed rest. But one famous story has it, when Gleason really felt ""sick"", he checked himself OUT of the hospital, and went home to be taken care of!      Despite his iconic stature as a TV-comedy giant, Gleason never won an Emmy.      Grandfather of actor Jason Patric.      Eponym of the Jackie Gleason (formerly 5th Avenue) Bus Depot in Brooklyn, New York.      Had an interest in the occult as well as an extensive collection of books on the paranormal.      Buried in Miami. His grave site is all that one would expect. Engraved in the ""riser"" of the second step from the top is the classic, ""AND AWAY WE GO"".      Father of actress Linda Miller.      On January 20, 1961, a game show he co-developed, ""You\'re In the Picture"" (1960), premiered on CBS. The premise was to have celebrity guests place their heads into a cutout scene and ask the host questions as to guess what picture or historical scene they were in. The show\'s concept was ill-conceived, especially for co-creator and host Gleason, and was blasted by critics and viewers alike. On the next week\'s broadcast Gleason apologized to the viewers, saying, ""Honesty is the best policy. We had a show last week that laid the biggest bomb! I\'ve seen bombs in my day, but this one made the H-bomb look like a two-inch salute."" The time slot was filled with a variety program; The Jackie Gleason Show (1961).      Recorded a number of albums featuring instrumental ""mood music"" (what is now known today as ""lounge music""). Gleason served as producer, band-leader, and (on occasion) vibraphone player, despite the fact that he couldn\'t read sheet music. Several of the albums included original compositions by Gleason. One album, ""Lonesome Echo"", topped the charts in 1955, and featured an album cover with original art by Salvador Dalí.      Once said that Orson Welles bestowed his ""The Great One"" nickname upon him.      The set of The Honeymooners (1955) show was based on Jackie\'s childhood home on Chauncey Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant (originally Bushwick) area of Brooklyn, New York. The apartment building is still there and looks very much the same as in Jackie\'s time.      On August 2000, cable television station TvLand unveiled an eight-foot bronze statue of Gleason as Ralph Kramden. The statue was placed in the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City.      There were plans to reunite him with Art Carney for Steven Spielberg\'s 1941 (1979). They were to play two men who would be stationed on top of a Ferris Wheel. However, Gleason\'s representatives informed the producers that he would not perform with Carney. But, by 1985, just two years before he died, he was reunited with Art Carney in Izzy & Moe (1985). They even shared over the credits billing, with Carney first, but lower left, and Gleason second, but upper right.      Biography in: ""Who\'s Who in Comedy"" by Ronald L. Smith, pg. 180-183. New York: Facts on File, 1992.  ISBN 0816023387      Inducted into the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame, 1986.      Did not like working with young children.      Won Broadway\'s 1960 Tony Award as Best Actor (Musical) for ""Take Me Along"" over his two also-nominated co-stars, Walter Pidgeon and Robert Morse .      He was not only a boxer and carnival barker in his early years, but also a pool hustler. Interestingly, he went on to play Minnesota Fats in The Hustler (1961) with Paul Newman.      The Miami Beach Auditorium was re-named the Jackie Gleason Theater and is located on 17th Street and Washington Avenue on South Beach.The Jackie Gleason Show (1961) helped propel the tourist industry in Miami Beach in the early & mid 1960s.      Was a mentor and frequent drinking buddy of Frank Sinatra. It was Gleason who first introduced Sinatra to Jack Daniels whiskey, which became Sinatra\'s signature drink.      His family background was, according to most accounts, almost Dickensian. It was marked by severe illness and grinding poverty, in any event. His father, Herb Gleason (1884-1964), was a henpecked insurance clerk who took his myriad disappointments in life out in drink. He deserted the family when Jackie was nine. His mother (d. 1935), the former Mae Kelly, was overprotective of her younger son, who died when Jackie was in his teens. An older brother, Clemence, died, probably of tuberculosis, at the age of fourteen, when Jackie was three.      In the 1930s, before he ever really made it even in smalltime venues, he was a bartender at a bar in Newark, New Jersey, called the Blue Mirror. He wore his apron high on the chest just like he did as his ""Joe the Bartender"" character 30 years later on his television show, and he entertained the patrons with his antics, just like ""Joe the Bartender."" Eventually, he got such a following that the owner gave him a chance at the microphone on stage. The rest, as they say, is history. This was also a time when he actually lived and slept in the back room with the empty bottles, etc. And, of course, it was across the street from a pool hall that he patronized in the afternoons after he was finished cleaning up the Blue Mirror.

His mother was also an Irish immigrant, from Farranree, Cork, Ireland.      The popular Hanna-Barbera character Fred Flintstone was based on him, as the Flintstones animated series was loosely based on the Honeymooners. Upon realizing this, Gleason tried to file a lawsuit against Hanna-Barbera but was dissuaded from doing so by friends and colleagues who advised him that it would be bad for his reputation if he became known as ""the man who killed Fred Flintstone."".

He first took the stage as a toddler in his parents vaudeville act at 17 months old. He made his first film appearance in 1926. The following year, he played the lead character in the first Mickey McGuire short film. It was in this popular film series that he took the stage name Mickey Rooney. Rooney reached new heights in 1937 with A Family Affair, the film that introduced the country to Andy Hardy, the popular all-American teenager. This beloved character appeared in nearly 20 films and helped make Rooney the top star at the box office in 1939, 1940 and 1941. Rooney also proved himself an excellent dramatic actor as a delinquent in Boys Town (1938) starring Spencer Tracy. In 1938, he was awarded a Juvenile Academy Award.Teaming up with Judy Garland, Rooney also appeared in a string of musicals, including Babes in Arms (1939) the first teenager to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor in a leading role, Strike Up the Band (1940), Babes on Broadway (1941), and Girl Crazy (1943). He and Garland immediately became best of friends. ""We weren\'t just a team, we were magic,"" Rooney once said. During that time he also appeared with Elizabeth Taylor in the now classic National Velvet (1944). Rooney joined the service that same year, where he helped to entertain the troops and worked on the American Armed Forces Network. He returned to Hollywood after 21 months in Love Laughs at Andy Hardy (1946), did a remake of a Robert Taylor film, The Crowd Roars (1932) called Killer McCoy (1947) and portrayed composer Lorenz Hart in Words and Music (1948). He also appeared in Breakfast at Tiffany\'s (1961), starring Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard. Rooney played Hepburn\'s Japanese neighbor, Mr. Yunioshi. A sign of the times, Rooney played the part for comic relief which he later regretted feeling the role was offensive. He once again showed his incredible range in the dramatic role of a boxing trainer with Anthony Quinn and Jackie Gleason in Requiem for a Heavyweight (1962). In the late 1960s and 1970s Rooney showed audiences and critics alike why he was one of Hollywood\'s most enduring stars. He gave an impressive performance in Francis Ford Coppola\'s 1979 film The Black Stallion (1979), which brought him an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor in a Supporting Role. He also turned to the stage in 1979 in Sugar Babies with Ann Miller, and was nominated for a Tony Award.

More recently he has appeared in such films as Night at the Museum (2006) with Ben Stiller and The Muppets (2011) with Amy Adams and Jason Segel.Rooney\'s personal life, including his frequent trips to the altar, has proved to be just as epic as his on-screen performances. His first wife was one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, actress Ava Gardner. Mickey permanently separated from his eighth wife Jan in June of 2012. In 2011 Rooney filed elder abuse and fraud charges against stepson Christopher Aber and Aber\'s wife. At Rooney\'s request, the Superior Court issued a restraining order against the Aber\'s demanding they stay 100 yards from Rooney, as well as Mickey\'s other son Mark Rooney and Mark\'s wife Charlene. Just prior, Rooney mustered the strength to break his silence and appeared before the Senate in Washington D.C. telling of his own heartbreaking story of abuse in an effort to live a peaceful, full life and help others who may be similarly suffering in silence.Rooney requested through the Superior Court to permanently reside with his son Mark Rooney, who is a musician and Marks wife Charlene, an artist, in the Hollywood Hills. He legally separated from his eighth wife in June of 2012. Ironically, after eight failed marriages he never looked or felt better and finally found happiness and peace in the single life. Mickey, Mark and Charlene focused on health, happiness and creative endeavors and it showed. Mickey Rooney had once again landed on his feet reminding us that he was a survivor.

Was co-owner for many years of the Mickey Rooney Tabas Hotel in Downingtown, PA.      In his autobiography, he made a passing reference to a brothel called ""The T&M; Studio,"" where the ladies were look-alikes for Hollywood starlets. There were rumors of such a brothel, but before Rooney\'s book no one would ever admit to ever having been there, or even verify its existence. He wrote that Groucho Marx had taken him there (only once), and Groucho appeared to be on a first-name basis with many of the ladies.

When he died his eight surviving children said in a statement that they were barred from seeing Rooney during his final years.Personal Quotes (35)      [at 58 years old] I\'m in pretty good shape for the shape I\'m in.      [asked if he would marry all of his eight wives again] Absolutely. I loved every one of them.      My partners weren\'t what we call in horse racing parlance ""routers"". They were sprinters; they went out of the gate, but then they stopped. They couldn\'t go the distance.      People say, ""How can you be married eight times?"" But I played the hand dealt me the way I was supposed to. I was friendly with most of my ex-wives. My God, there\'s a Mickey Rooney\'s Former Wives Marching Band!      [on his marriages] When I say ""I do"", the Justice of the Peace replies, ""I know, I know"". I\'m the only man in the world whose marriage license reads, ""To Whom it May Concern"". But to have been married eight times is not normal. That\'s only halfway intelligent.      You\'ve got to recognize, there will never be another you. It has nothing to do with ego; it happens to be the truth. There will never be another person the same. There\'ll never be another you. There\'ll never be another me . . . And there\'ll never be another show like this!      The audience and I are friends. They allowed me to grow up with them. I\'ve let them down several times. They\'ve let me down several times. But we\'re all family.      Love wears off too quickly.      I don\'t regret anything I\'ve ever done. I only wish I could have done more.      I was a 14-year-old boy for 30 years.      [upon winning his lifetime achievement Oscar, 1983] Tonight, I could even kiss Louis B. Mayer!.      [on his lifelong friend and frequent co-star, Judy Garland] Judy turned to drugs because she was in pain and because drugs made her feel good. As one of the MGM kids, she\'d been treated for most of her life to magical, instant solutions to everything . . . She could never accept herself, so she was always on the run.      I didn\'t ask to be short. I didn\'t want to be short. I\'ve tried to pretend that being a short guy didn\'t matter.      The guys with the power in Hollywood today, the guys with their names above the title, are thieves. They don\'t make movies, they make deals. Their major function is to cut themselves in for 10% of the gross--off the top, of course--which is why they make movies that cost $50 million.      [Bill Clinton] was a Rhodes Scholar. Do you know who the scholars were? Marxists!      I just want to be a professional. I couldn\'t live without acting.      There may be a little snow on the mountain, but there\'s a lot of fire in the furnace.      All the muddy waters of my life cleared up when I gave myself to Christ.      I\'ve been through four publics. I\'ve been coming back like a rubber ball for years.      [on his feud with Ernest Borgnine] All the Oscars in the world can\'t buy him dignity, class and talent. I don\'t know why he is famous and why he is a star. Talk about a lucky jerk.      If it\'s immorally wrong, it\'s not normal. Jesus Christ said, ""The effeminate are an abomination to me"". Are you aware of that? I don\'t watch the [Ellen DeGeneres] show. I wish her all kinds of luck. Except that I\'m not a fan. But there are a lot of people who aren\'t fans of Mickey Rooney and you can\'t please everyone.      [in 2007] I think the family pictures are what people really want to see--and musicals, of course.      I don\'t get caught between lesbians and gays. If you can\'t say something nice about someone, just shut your mouth.      I never knew anything about anyone being gay in Hollywood when I was working in the studios. Did you know that? They weren\'t in closets, they were in safes.      I lost $2 at Santa Anita and I\'ve spent $3 million trying to get it back.      Sure, I love the chicks. I love \'em all. But when you\'re nuts about too many, how can a guy settle down to one?      Hollywood has unfortunately become a memory. It\'s nothing but a sign on the side of a hill.      When I was 19 years old I was the #1 star for two years. When I was 40, nobody wanted me. I couldn\'t get a job.      There was, in fact, a standard studio recipe. Take one young actress, pluck her eyebrows, cap her teeth, shape her hairline, pad as required and throw her into the ring with Andy Hardy. Then wait and see. If the public responded, the starlet became a star.      I was aware, even at age three, that my father had a penchant for going out by himself after a show, then returning at dawn with a nervous grin on his face. I could only guess, from my mother\'s angry reactions that he was doing something that hurt her very much. She kept talking about my dad\'s ""floozies""--which I took to be another name for ""bartender."" You see, I thought my dad had a problem with Punch, not with Judy.      When ""Sugar Babies"" opened, I was the most famous has-been in show business.      [In his autobiography] Had I been brighter, had the ladies been gentler, had the scotch been weaker, had the gods been kinder, this could have been a one-sentence story: Once upon a time, Mickey Rooney lived happily ever after.      [In a 1970 David Frost interview] I have nine kids, seven wives, and the American Bar Association to support. I\'m a very quiet person, a fellow who believes in the Ten Commandments, the Golden Rule, and bacon, lettuce and tomato with a lot of mayonnaise.      [observation as a young man on his most famous role] It\'s funny how a character can grow on a feller. I depend on [Andy Hardy] all the time. When I\'m not sure whether I should do a certain thing, I ask myself, ""Would Andy do it?"" And if Andy won\'t do it, I won\'t.      [2008, on the controversy surrounding his Breakfast at Tiffany\'s (1961) role] Blake Edwards wanted me to do it because he was a comedy director. They hired me to do this overboard, and we had fun doing it . . . Never in all the more than 40 years after we made it--not one complaint. Every place I\'ve gone in the world people say, ""God, you were so funny"". Asians and Chinese come up to me and say, ""Mickey, you were out of this world"", [Had I known people would get offended] I wouldn\'t have done it. Those that didn\'t like it, I forgive them and God bless America, God bless the universe, God bless Japanese, Chinese, Indians, all of them and let\'s have peace.Salary (60)Not to Be Trusted\xa0(1926)      $200       Mickey\'s Circus\xa0(1927)      $250 /week      Mickey\'s Pals\xa0(1927)      $250 /week      Mickey\'s Eleven\xa0(1927)      $250 /week      Mickey\'s Battle\xa0(1927)      $250 /week      Mickey\'s Parade\xa0(1928)      $250 /week      Mickey\'s Nine\xa0(1928)      $250 /week      Mickey\'s Wild West\xa0(1928)      $250 /week      Mickey\'s Triumph\xa0(1928)      $250 /week      Mickey\'s Movies\xa0(1928)      $250 /week      Mickey\'s Rivals\xa0(1928)      $250 /week      Mickey the Detective\xa0(1928)      $250 /week      Mickey\'s Wildcats\xa0(1931)      $250 /week      A Midsummer Night\'s Dream\xa0(1935)      $500 /week      Ah Wilderness!\xa0(1935)      $500 /week      Little Lord Fauntleroy\xa0(1936)      $500 /week      The Devil Is a Sissy\xa0(1936)      $500 /week      Captains Courageous\xa0(1937)      $500 /week      Slave Ship\xa0(1937)      $500 /week      Hoosier Schoolboy\xa0(1937)      $500 /week      Live, Love and Learn\xa0(1937)      $500 /week      Thoroughbreds Don\'t Cry\xa0(1937)      $500 /week      You\'re Only Young Once\xa0(1937)      $5,000       Love Is a Headache\xa0(1938)      $5,000       Judge Hardy\'s Children\xa0(1938)      $5,000       Hold That Kiss\xa0(1938)      $5,000       Lord Jeff\xa0(1938)      $5,000       Love Finds Andy Hardy\xa0(1938)      $5,000       Boys Town\xa0(1938)      $5,000       Stablemates\xa0(1938)      $5,000       Out West with the Hardys\xa0(1938)      $5,000       Babes in Arms\xa0(1939)      $23,000       Babes on Broadway\xa0(1941)      $53,333 a week plus $25,000 bonus      The Courtship of Andy Hardy\xa0(1942)      $2,500 /week      A Yank at Eton\xa0(1942)      $2,500       Andy Hardy\'s Double Life\xa0(1942)      $2,500 /week      The Human Comedy\xa0(1943)      $2,500 /week      Thousands Cheer\xa0(1943)      $2,500 /week      Girl Crazy\xa0(1943)      $68,000       Andy Hardy\'s Blonde Trouble\xa0(1944)      $2,500 /week      National Velvet\xa0(1944)      $2,500 /week      The Big Wheel\xa0(1949)      $25,000       Quicksand\xa0(1950)      $25,000       Sound Off\xa0(1952)      $75,000       All Ashore\xa0(1953)      $75,000       A Slight Case of Larceny\xa0(1953)      $75,000       Drive a Crooked Road\xa0(1954)      $75,000       The Mickey Rooney Show\xa0(1954)      $3,500 /week      The Comedian\xa0(1957)      $10,000       Baby Face Nelson\xa0(1957)      $35,000       Andy Hardy Comes Home\xa0(1958)      $35,000       Breakfast at Tiffany\'s\xa0(1961)      $25,000       It\'s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World\xa0(1963)      $100,000       Funny Man with a Monkey\xa0(1964)      $10,000       Mickey\xa0(1964)      $5,000 /episode      The Secret Invasion\xa0(1964)      $50,000       How to Stuff a Wild Bikini\xa0(1965)      $5,000       The Black Stallion\xa0(1979)      $75,000       Babe: Pig in the City\xa0(1998)      $175,000       Night at the Museum\xa0(2006)      $250,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nJulie Harris ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 53 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(3)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(3)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(22)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(19)\xa0|Salary\xa0(1)  Overview (4)Date of Birth2\xa0December1925,\xa0Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan, USA Date of Death24\xa0August2013,\xa0West Chatham, Massachusetts, USA      \xa0(congestive heart failure)    Birth NameJulia Anne HarrisHeight5\'\xa03""\xa0(1.6\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          One of the finest classical and contemporary leading ladies ever to grace the 20th century American stage, five-time Tony Award winner Julie Harris was rather remote and reserved on camera, finding her true glow in front of the theatre lights. The freckled, red-haired actress not only was nominated for a whopping total of ten Tony awards and was a Sarah Siddons Award recipient for her work on the Chicago stage, she also earned awards in other areas of the entertainment industry, including three Emmys (of 11 nominations), a Grammy and an Academy Award nomination. (Note: Harris would hold the record for the most competitive Tony performance wins (five) for a couple of decades. Angela Lansbury finally caught up with her in 2009 and singer/actress Audra McDonald surpassed them both in 2014 with six). While Harris certainly lacked the buoyancy and glamor usually associated with being a movie star, she certainly made an impact in the early to mid 1950s with three iconic leading roles, two of which she resurrected from the Broadway stage. After that she pretty much deserted film.Born Julie Ann Harris on December 2, 1925, in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, she was the daughter of William Pickett, an investment banker, and Elsie L. (née Smith) Harris, a nurse. Graduating from Grosse Pointe Country Day School, an early interest in the performance arts was encouraged by her family. Moving to New York City, Julie attended The Hewitt School and later trained as a teenager at the Perry-Mansfield Performing Arts School & Camp in Colorado. A mentor there, Charlotte Perry, saw great hope for young Julie and was insistent that her protégé study at the Yale School of Drama. Julie did just that -- for about a year.Also trained at the New York School of Drama and one of the earliest members of the Acting Studio, young Julie made her Broadway debut in 1945 at age 19 in the comedy ""It\'s a Gift"". Despite its lukewarm reception, the demure, diminutive (5\'3""), and delicate-looking thespian moved on. She apprenticed on Broadway for the next few years with ensemble parts in ""King Henry IV, Part II"" (1946), ""Oedipus Rex"" (1946), ""The Playboy of the Western World"" (1946), ""Alice in Wonderland"" (as the White Rabbit) (1947), and Macbeth"" (1948).More prominent roles came her way in such short-lived Broadway plays as ""Sundown Beach"" (1948), ""The Young and Fair"" (1948), ""Magnolia Alley"" (1949) and ""Montserrat (1949). This led to her star-making theatre role at age 24 as sensitive 12-year-old tomboy Frankie Addams in the classic drama ""The Member of the Wedding"" (1950) opposite veteran actress Ethel Waters and based on the Carson McCullers novel. The play ran for over a year. The Member of the Wedding (1952) would eventually be transferred to film and, despite being untried talents on film, director Fred Zinnemann wisely included both Harris and young Brandon De Wilde (as young John Henry) to reenact their stage triumphs along with Ms. Waters. Harris, at 27, received her first and only Academy Award nomination as the coming-of-age Georgian tomboy.It wasn\'t long before Julie\'s exceptional range and power won noticed nationwide. In 1952, she received her first ""Best Actress"" Tony Award for creating the larger-than-life role of Sally Bowles in ""I Am a Camera,"" the stage version of one of Christopher Isherwood\'s Berlin stories (""Goodbye to Berlin"" (1939). (Note: In the 1960s, Isherwood\'s play would be transformed successfully into the Broadway musical ""Cabaret"".) Harris again was invited to repeat her stage role in I Am a Camera (1955) with Laurence Harvey and Shelley Winters, winning the BAFTA ""Best Foreign Actress"" Award. That same year Harris starred opposite the highly emotive James Dean (she had top billing) as his love interest in the classic film East of Eden (1955), directed by Elia Kazan from the John Steinbeck novel. Strangely, Julie\'s brilliance in the role of Abra was completely overlooked come Oscar time...a terrible miscarriage of justice in this author\'s view.After this vivid film exposure, Julie\'s love for the theatre completely dominated her career focus. She continued to increase her Broadway prestige with such plays as ""Mademoiselle Colombe"" (title role) (1954), ""The Lark"" (Tony Award: as Joan of Arc) (1955), ""The Country Wife"" (1957), ""The Warm Peninsula"" (1959), ""Little Moon Over Alban"" (1960) (which she took to Emmy-winning TV), ""A Shot in the Dark"" (1961), ""Ready When Your Are, C.B.!"" (1964), ""Skyscraper"" (1965), ""Forty Carats"" (Tony Award) (1968), ""And Miss Reardon Drinks a Little"" ) (1971), ""The Au Pair Man"" (1973) and ""In Praise of Love"" (1974). In between she gave stellar performances on TV with her Joan of Arc in The Lark (1957); title role in Johnny Belinda (1958); Nora in Ibsen\'s A Doll\'s House (1959); Catherine Sloper in The Heiress (1961); title role in Victoria Regina (1961) (for which received an Emmy award); Eliza Doolittle in Pygmalion (1963), and title role in Anastasia (1967).BeIn later years Harris reaped praises and honors for her awe-inspiring one-woman touring shows based on the lives of certain distaff historical figureheads. Her magnificently tormented, Tony-winning ""First Lady"" Mary Lincoln in ""The Last of Mrs. Lincoln"" (1972) was the first to be seen on stage and TV, followed by another Tony (and Grammy) Award-winning performance as poetess Emily Dickinson in ""The Belle of Amherst"" (1976) (directed by close friend Charles Nelson Reilly, as well as her early 1980s solo portrait of author Charlotte Brontë in ""Bronte,"" which started out as a radio play. Julie was now placed among the theatre\'s luminous ""ruling class"" alongside legendary veterans Helen Hayes, Katharine Cornell and Judith Anderson.As time wore on, Harris would become equally respected on film and TV for her portrayals of over-the-edge neurotics, wallflowers and eccentric maiden aunt types as witnessed by her co-starring roles in the films The Haunting (1963), Hamlet (1964) (as Ophelia), Harper (1966), You\'re a Big Boy Now (1966), Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967), The Bell Jar (1979), and the TV-movies How Awful About Allan (1970) and Home for the Holidays (1972). Perhaps a step down performance wise, the veteran actress, after a period of ill health, became a household name with her regular series work as Lilimae on the TV soap Knots Landing (1979).At age 60, Harris continued to impress on Broadway with her 1990\'s versions of Amanda Wingfield in ""The Glass Menagerie"" and Fonsia Dorsey in ""The Gin Game"" for which she received her tenth and final Tony nomination. She also toured successfully with a production of ""Lettice and Lovage"". Unlike many other actors whose film roles disintegrated with appearances in bottom-of-the-barrel lowbudgets, Julie\'s final two supporting films roles were in two nicely constructed period romantic comedies -- The Golden Boys (2008) and The Lightkeepers (2009).Ill health dogged Julie\'s later years (she battled breast cancer in 1981 and suffered two strokes -- one in 2001 (while performing in the Chicago play ""Fossils"") and again in 2010). Nevertheless, she continued to work almost until the end, including narrating five historical documentaries and giving Emmy-winning voice to such women suffragettes as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.Married and divorced three times, Julie had one son by her second marriage -- Peter, who became a theatre critic. She also spent time enjoying the benefits of receiving special awards and honors for her full body of work. Among these, she was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1979, was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 1994, received a ""Special Lifetime Achievement"" Tony Award in 2002 and was a 2005 Kennedy Center honoree.Harris died on August 24, 2013, of congestive heart failure at her home in West Chatham, Massachusetts.

In 1950, she made her mark on the stage at age 24 playing 12-year-old Frankie Addams in Carson McCullers\'s adaptation of her own novel \'The Member of the Wedding\'. She then reprised the role in the 1952 screen version with the same title.      As a young girl, Harris says she saw Gone with the Wind (1939) 13 times and also read biographies of great actresses.      Her parents sent her to a finishing school in Providence, Rhode Island, before she persuaded them to let her transfer to a girl\'s prep school in Manhattan then known as Miss Hewitt\'s Classes, which offered drama. Harris also attended a summer acting camp in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, where she was mentored by Charlotte Perry, who encouraged her to attend the Yale School of Drama, which she did for a year.      The daughter of investment broker William Pickett Harris.      Studied for a year at the New York Drama School before becoming one of the first members of Lee Strasberg\'s Actor\'s Studio.      She was known to be a very private person.      Had never retired from acting.      She was awarded the 1980 Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for Distinguished Performance in a Play for ""On Golden Pond"" at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, California.Personal Quotes (19)      [on the late James Dean]: And he took me for a ride that I thought would be my last, up in the Hollywood hills and so fast that my heart was in my throat, but instead of saying to him, \'Slow down, Jimmy,\' I didn\'t say anything. I was, like, \'Whe-e-e-e-e.\' As long as I didn\'t say, \'Hey, don\'t go so fast,\' I was a comrade. And after that we just always got on. He knew I was in his corner.      [About actresses successfully blending their career and their family]: It mixes very well if you have a balance about it. It was just at the time when I had a family, I wasn\'t balanced about it. I was rigid about how it should be and you can\'t be rigid about anything. I was brought up to think there was a proper place for everything. I thought then that you shouldn\'t nurse a baby in the theater. Well, now I think, why not? Everything is proper as long as it\'s congenial. Nowadays, the young women are much more relaxed about that. Look at Sissy Spacek and Meryl Streep.      [About her friendship with James Dean in 1991]: I wasn\'t attracted to him, I loved Jimmy\'s spirit, but I didn\'t want to \'make\' him. We were comrades.      If Sally Bowles had ever been Liza Minnelli, she would have set Berlin on its ear.      [on her professional friendship with Ruby Dee]: Ruby just lost her husband, well, it\'s a mystery of life. But Ruby is just so beautiful. She\'s just wonderful. We had a good time doing the movie.      [on the list of awards she has won over the years]: It\'s wonderful. I have worked on that stage a lot of times, on that wonderful stage in the Kennedy theater there.      [About living in a hotel]: It\'s very pleasant, there is no housework. I remain unmarried, although I don\'t always live alone.      I always thought it would be wonderful to wake up in the morning and look like Brigitte Bardot.      [In 1976 when she remembered the Emily Dickinson poetry]: Seventeen years ago I did a recording of her poetry, and then I started to read.      [In 1974 about her religion]: I was sent to Sunday School in the Episcopal Church and I was confirmed in the Episcopal Church, and never went back. If it tells the truth about life and the human heart, if it speaks of men\'s failings and also their grandeur and hope, then it is religious.      [on the death of Marlon Brando]: He didn\'t love acting, but his gift was so great he couldn\'t defile it.      [on her Nanny character]: I cry all the time, and laugh, too.      [In 1981]: I think life is translated. We\'re always in a state of change. Acting is more translated than a lot of things. Theater is about what we are. We need it to express ourselves.      [In 2006]: \'The Stage!\' I knew it was where I wanted to be, I loved it all. It became this great source of nourishment, spiritual nourishment, for me. I want to touch people with the meaning of life. What is thrilling about the theater is that it\'s a forum where people come and for those two or three hours belong to something, to ideas, to a feeling of being a member of the human race.      Pictures make me look like a twelve-year-old boy who flunked his body-building course.      Acting is always an adventure, and a struggle, and a quest to find the truth...It\'s wanting to do it right, that\'s where the fear comes in, but who can say what\'s right? We\'re very delicate creatures, aren\'t we?      I love biographies. I get very excited by the truth that comes out of what people have left behind, like letters. I first fell in love with Emily Dickinson when I read her letters. It\'s like listening to someone\'s heart.      Some people asked me, \'Why do you have to cry so much in [stage play] \'The Last of Mrs. Lincoln?\' My answer was that she was always crying. She couldn\'t speak of her children who died, without crying. And after the assassination, her whole life was gone. She clung to the pain. As actors, that\'s what we deal with. My mother used to say to me, \'But you\'re so dramatic.\' Yes, I\'d say, that\'s what I\'m supposed to be. Life is dramatic, all the time, much more than on stage.

This is a golden oldie if there ever was one.  Adapted from Rod Serling's
earlier `Playhouse 90' TV drama, it improved greatly on the original by
taking full advantage of the film medium, including moody film-noir
lighting, an excellent music score, and superb direction.  Anthony Quinn
is
excellent, getting all the pathos out of the role without overdoing it.
Mickey Rooney and Jackie Gleason, neither of whom is renowned for subtlety
and restraint, hit just the right note in their performances, as does
Julie
Harris.  The ending of this film couldn't be more different than the
`Playhouse 90' ending.  One of the more bizarre elements of this film,
which
was not in the original TV play, is the character of Ma Greeney, a really
frightening person and the only example I am aware of in film of a lesbian
gangster (and in 1962, yet).  I can still remember how startled I was to
see
this character when I first watched this film on TV back in the late
1960s.<br><br>The new DVD of `Requiem for a Heavyweight' offers both a full-screen and
wide-screen presentation.  The quality of the transfer is really
outstanding.  The liner notes indicate that it is mastered in high
definition.  While I don't have the hardware to watch it in high-def., I
can
say that on an ordinary monitor it looks outstanding.  Perhaps the
sharpest
DVD picture I've ever seen.  The sound is clear, and the subtitles are
very
helpful in picking out dialog that may be indistinct, or not easily
understood because of Anthony Quinn's manner of delivering the lines while
in character.<br><br>However.  It seems to me that at least one whole scene and a part of
another
scene is missing.  I distinctly remember Maish (Jackie Gleason) telling Ma
Greeney what he would do to her if she weren't a lady.  In response, she
laughs and says `that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.'  This
is
part of the early scene where Maish is attacked in an abandoned boxing
ring
by Ma's thugs.  There is another whole scene I can recall in which
Mountain
(Anthony Quinn) is practicing holds with a wrestler.  He asks that the
wrestler stay away from his injured eye, and when he purposely goes for
the
eye, Mountain punches his lights out.  The cuts I recall seeing on TV
years
ago always included these scenes, and I've never seen this shortened cut
of
the film before.  It's still a great film, but I really miss these two
scenes.

A sad, heartbreaking, and somewhat disturbing story. Quinn is totally
believable as Mountain Rivera, a boxer who, perhaps, has been in the
game too long and finds himself forced out. While his world-weary cut
man (Rooney) is protective of him to an extent, his manager (Gleason)
only views Rivera as a paycheck. An unemployment agency staff person
(Miller) sees something in Rivera that prompts him to go above and
beyond the call of duty to help him get a job. All of the leads are
extremely good. It appears that most of the film takes place in the
dark, highlighting the seamy side of boxing. The only daytime scene is
when Rivera visits the unemployment office, and even then, it appears
that the place has no windows to see outside. The office is just as
closed up and restricted as Rivera's limited choices after his career
ends. The actress who portrayed the underworld figure that Rivera's
manager has a connection to was appropriately evil and creepy. The very
last scene, filled with a sense of finality and resignation, is
powerful.

                   Anthony Quinn, Jackie Gleason and Mickey Rooney made this
film a great black and white film classic for all future generations. 
However,  as a young boy living in Richmond Hill, Queens during the 1940's,
I had Abe Simon (great prize fighter, who fought Joe Lewis) a neighbor who
lived down the street.  Abe Simon was an adviser for this film along with
Willie Pep (World Featherweight boxing Champion 1942-48/ 1949-50) Abe Simon
looked like a giant and had huge hands, but was a very kind and down to
earth person and well liked. Willie was also an adviser in this film for
Anthony Quinn and later became a bouncer in NYC.  These great boxer's gave
this film the great realism that it has and it was great to see them along
with another great boxer, Jack Dempsey, who owned a food establishment on
Broadway NYC.   This film clearly shows the horrible results of boxing in
the ring for a profession, however, all boxers and future boxers should be
praised for their great gifts in that field of endeavor.

******SPOILERS****** Getting knocked out by Cassius Clay in the seventh
round proved to be the end of the line for former heavyweight contender
Louis ""Mountain"" Rivera, Anthony Quinn. After the fight in Mountain's
dressing room the fight doctor checking the damage to his left eye
tells his manager and trainer Maish and Army, Jackie Gleason and Mickey
Rooney, that he can't allow Mountain to fight anymore. The next punch
to his head can very well bind or even kill him. <br><br>His brains scrambled his fists busted in danger of losing his eyesight
17 years in the fight game is all the battering that Mountain's body
could take. Now after 17 years it was time for Mountain to hang up his
boxing gloves and go into another line of work, but what kind of work
could Mountain do? Unknown to Mountain and his trainer Army his manager
Maish had given the Ma Greeny mob the word that his fighter won't last
more then 4 rounds with the young and hard hitting Cassius Clay and
they place a lot of money on the tip that Maish gave them. Mountain
going more then 4 rounds with Clay cost the Greeny mob big and it was
up to Maish to come up with the money by the end of the month or else
Maish won't ever have any need for money again. Without Mountain being
able to fight anymore the only way Maish can get the money for the
Greeny mob is for Mountain to become a professional wrestler and thus
making a joke of himself entertaining the public. This time instead of
taking punches Mountain will be taking laughs. <br><br>Rod Serling's hard hitting screen-play about the fight game and how it
chews up and spits out those who are in it like Louis ""Mountain"" Rivera
when it no longer has any use for them. Touching performance by Anthony
Quinn as the broken down Mountain who has to humiliate himself by being
a clown in the ring as a wrestler after being a proud warrior in the
ring as a boxer. Also very moving is Julie Harris as Grace Miller the
social worker who does her best to get Mountain a job as a youth
consular only to have him lose it by getting drunk celebrating getting
it.<br><br>As hard hitting as the punches thrown in the ring and as powerful as
those boxers in the ring taking them. Mountain makes a fool of himself
to save his crooked managers, Maish, hide so he could have the money to
pay back the mob that he owes them, but that ended his friendship with
Maish. It also educated Maish about being honest and loyal to those who
trust and depend on him which is something that he didn't know about up
till then. The film ends with Mountain swallowing his pride and
accepting what fate had in store for him.

Requiem for a Heavyweight is a great ensemble piece revolving around
four characters. It's a tribute to the skill of Rod Serling's
screenplay and the direction of Ralph Nelson that no one of them
dominates the story.<br><br>Anthony Quinn as Mountain Rivera has been given the final knockout by
the New York State Athletic Commission after a fight with up and coming
heavyweight, Cassius Clay. His eyes won't take too many more blows, so
his license is being pulled. He's got to look for another line of work,
but ring skills and a sixth grade education is all he has for the job
market. <br><br>If that wasn't enough, his manager Jackie Gleason made some bets and
got some other gamblers to bet that Quinn wouldn't stand up more than
three rounds under Clay's fists. The gamblers want their money. <br><br>What to do, Gleason thinks he can get him a gig as a wrestler, but the
idea of putting on an Indian suit offends his sensibilities. The whole
thing offends Mickey Rooney who is Quinn's corner man and Julie Harris,
an employment counselor, has different ideas all together for Quinn.<br><br>It's a bitter thing for Quinn to not only learn he's through at the
only thing he knows, but that his manager and friend doesn't even
believe in him any more. The rest of the film is devoted to how all of
the four of them will deal with a very bleak future.<br><br>Julie Harris does not get too many comments, but she has an interesting
role as a prim and sexually frustrated middle aged civil servant who
sees in Quinn some kind of personal reclamation project. Her life
however has not given her any perspective in dealing with the boxing
game and the people in it.<br><br>Gleason might have the bleakest future of all whether his gambling
debts are paid or not. This is probably Jackie Gleason's best dramatic
role and he's brilliant. For one thing he won't even have Mickey Rooney
around who acts as everybody's conscience. Rooney is another ex-fighter
who survives by tending to the cuts of competing pugilists and it's not
something he likes, but something he does well and it keeps him in the
only game he knows.<br><br>It all gets resolved, but not to everyone's liking in the end. Requiem
for a Heavyweight is a brilliant piece of acting about the underside of
the fight game and the bleak future that a lot who survive it have.

DO NOT MISS THIS FILM!<br><br>This film is a masterpiece which depicted the seamy side of low level
boxing at St. Nichols or ""St. Nicks"" Arena in Brooklyn, NY. The old
Stillman Gym shots show just how few ever made any money or fame before
being destroyed by too many punches to the head. Jackie Gleason
personified the low rent scum that rode any fighter to death. Rivera
was so hopelessly trapped that Anthony Quinn caught the essence of the
man and his slow descent into being a meal ticket for Gleason and a bad
joke in the wrestling game. Harris was brilliant as the NY Social
Worker and idealist. She caught the last glimmer of hope in Rivera and
tried to help but was defeated when he turned out to be hopelessly
owned by Gleason. Rooney was brilliant but I preferred Myron McCormick
in the TV film a few years earlier. Having been to St. Knicks as a kid,
I know the realness of this story because I saw them, smelled them and
felt for some of the dying, which is what most of them were doing. All
the stars in the world for this one.

This Rod Serling written story originally was televised on the old CBS
Playhouse 90 program which was live TV.  This film produced by David
Susskind sticks pretty much to the Playhouse 90 version with a few
variations and a couple of characters.  Anthony Quinn seems more like a
heavyweight than Jack Palance did for one thing and the individual that
Maish Rennick is in debt to is also more colorful than in the
Teleplay.
 Jackie Gleason, Mickey Rooney and Julie Harris are as good in their roles
as the actors who were in the Teleplay.  The ending is slightly different
and I found it to have more stark realism than the Teleplay.  Check out the

Jackie Gleason is in his element as promoter/manager/trainer of a
broken down end-of-the-road boxer ""Mountain Rivera"" played brilliantly
by Anthony Quinn. After 17 punishing years getting battered in the Ring
""The Mountain"" sports the scars, brain paralysis and the ""shot"" hoarse
voice of an ex-fighter who is played to the hilt by Quinn. Mickey
Rooney as ""Mountain's"" trainer is also sensational in his role. The
whole cast in this film is simply fantastic. The writing of Rod Serling
(of ""Twilight Zone"" fame) is masterful to say the least. Julie Harris
who tries to provide hope for Rivera's future is beautifully and
""tenderly"" rendered on screen. The sleazy nature of the boxing business
in the seedy surroundings of the cockroach infested hotel rooms is
starkly defined in this black and white celluloid. There is a scene
with Mickey Rooney and Jackie Gleason playing cards reminiscent of ""The
Honeymooners"" with Art Carney when Gleason explodes in exasperation at
Rooney who delays playing his hand at ""gin"" rummy. This is a taut and
brilliantly portrayed film that everyone should see. Muhammed Ali (as
Cassius Clay) is hauntingly shot at the beginning of the film. Jack
Dempsey, the former heavyweight champ, is also shown at his restaurant
in New York. The corruption and fear in this business is tellingly
displayed. In fact this is a ""must see"" and ""must own"" kind of film. A
Knock Out! As an aside, Jackie Gleason was so great on film partly
because of his experience in live vaudeville shows. He grew up in
abject poverty as a boy. This forced him out at an early age to make a
living. The greatness came from hard times, talent and an insatiable
work ethic. Thus the great talent of Jackie Gleason began to shine to
the point of dethroning Milton Berle out of the top TV spot in 1954 as
""The Honeymooners"" stormed on screen. So many great talents from this
era developed in the same way. Poverty and hard times had a way of
producing talented star entertainers in the 30's and 40's. Perhaps this
explains the lack of talent on screen today.

The sport of professional boxing takes another beating in this tragic
and powerful re-make of the Rod Serling Playhouse 90 teleplay. The film
opens from the viewpoint of Mountain Rivera, a once ranked heavyweight,
being pummeled by a youthful Cassius Clay. Rivera loses the fight,
beaten so senseless that when asked where he is (NYC) he responds ""I'm
in Pittsburgh and its raining"". When the the fight doctor examines him
he makes it clear this broken down pug is all washed up. This puts his
manager Maish in a bind since he bet Mountain wouldn't get past the
fourth round with some thugs who also lost money because of his
guarantee. Maish needs cash fast and the only way he can get it is to
get his washed up fighter to wrestle. Rivera considers it degrading
(remember it's 1962) and refuses.<br><br>Requiem is top heavy with strong performances from its quartet of
leads. Jackie Gleason as sleazy Maish is given more to work with here
than his Oscar nominated Minnesota Fats. He's a desperate man, wracked
with guilt but ready to sell out Mountain to stay breathing. Mickey
Rooney gives probably his finest adult performance as Army, the trainer
who has Mountain's best interest at heart. Julie Harris as the social
worker assigned to find him employment seems incapable of giving
anything less than solid performances in everything she does and she
does not disappoint here. Then there is Anthony Quinn doing what he

The film version of REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT had some major
differences from the television version made five years earlier. To be
fair the television version is better because it has a more positive
push than the film does - but somehow one senses that in the real world
""Mountain"" Rivera would have been doomed to his sad fate rather than
the happy ending for ""Mountain"" McClintock.<br><br>The first difference is that Louis ""Mountain"" Rivera (Anthony Quinn) is
Latino, and not as solidly grounded in the United States as his
television version ""Mountain"" McClintock (Jack Palance). Quinn really
is dependent on his manager Maish (here Jackie Gleason, possibly in his
best performance), because of his ethnicity. And up to a point they did
well together, but Rivera is aging, and can't compete with younger
boxers (he loses the bout at the start to a young Mohammad Ali - here
under his old name of Cassius Clay). Although he was once the eighth
best heavyweight boxer in the world, he is a has-been. His serious eye
damage from repeated boxing matches is potentially leading to
blindness. He can't box anymore.<br><br>But, as in the television version, Maish has bet on Mountain losing in
a particular round, and Mountain stayed into another further round.
Maish got several gamblers to bet with him, and they are after him to
pay them back. Maish is willing to do so, but at Mountain's expense. As
the two biggest gambler - creditors, Ma Greeny (Madame Spivy) and
Pinelli (Stanley Adams) want Mountain to become a professional wrestler
until (at least) the debt is paid off.<br><br>Maish pulls everything to force Mountain into line. He is opposed by
Army (Mickey Rooney), who is far more caustic towards Maish in this
version than Ed Wynn was towards Keenan Wynn in the television version.
Army pushes Mountain to go to an employment agency where he is taken
under the wing of Grace Miller (Julie Harris) who wants to help him get
a job as a camp counselor. Mountain, proud but confused - and still
under Maish's emotional control - likes this idea. Maish sees himself
losing his power over the pugilist, but then turns to Mountain's worst
failing: he gets Mountain drunk.<br><br>The collapse of Mountain, who for all his failings is a proud man, is
the tragic conclusion of this version. Maish's sin is revealed to him,
finally breaking the bind between them (it is a tremendous act of
treachery to Mountain's pride). But when Greeny and Pinelli point out
that they'll kill Maish unless Mountain goes into the wrestling game
(dressed as an Indian, and making false war whoops for the crowd),
Mountain agrees. But he and Army leave Maish alone - they'll save his
life but that is the payment for what he did for Mountain. After that
they won't have anything to do with Maish, and he is left at the end of
the film realizing how much his selfishness has lost.<br><br>I'd like to point out the performance of Madame Spivy - she plays Ma
Greeny as a dike-type, and is quite threatening as a result. Stanley
Adams repeats his part as Pinelli, disguising his viciousness with a
false bonhomie and laugh (like a sloppy looking Sidney Greenstreet).
Both performers help make the grundginess of this portion of humanity
all the more real to the viewers. Not as good as the television version
(in my view), but quite good on it's own.

This is a golden oldie if there ever was one.  Adapted from Rod Serling's
earlier `Playhouse 90' TV drama, it improved greatly on the original by
taking full advantage of the film medium, including moody film-noir
lighting, an excellent music score, and superb direction.  Anthony Quinn
is
excellent, getting all the pathos out of the role without overdoing it.
Mickey Rooney and Jackie Gleason, neither of whom is renowned for subtlety
and restraint, hit just the right note in their performances, as does
Julie
Harris.  The ending of this film couldn't be more different than the
`Playhouse 90' ending.  One of the more bizarre elements of this film,
which
was not in the original TV play, is the character of Ma Greeney, a really
frightening person and the only example I am aware of in film of a lesbian
gangster (and in 1962, yet).  I can still remember how startled I was to
see
this character when I first watched this film on TV back in the late
1960s.<br><br>The new DVD of `Requiem for a Heavyweight' offers both a full-screen and
wide-screen presentation.  The quality of the transfer is really
outstanding.  The liner notes indicate that it is mastered in high
definition.  While I don't have the hardware to watch it in high-def., I
can
say that on an ordinary monitor it looks outstanding.  Perhaps the
sharpest
DVD picture I've ever seen.  The sound is clear, and the subtitles are
very
helpful in picking out dialog that may be indistinct, or not easily
understood because of Anthony Quinn's manner of delivering the lines while
in character.<br><br>However.  It seems to me that at least one whole scene and a part of
another
scene is missing.  I distinctly remember Maish (Jackie Gleason) telling Ma
Greeney what he would do to her if she weren't a lady.  In response, she
laughs and says `that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.'  This
is
part of the early scene where Maish is attacked in an abandoned boxing
ring
by Ma's thugs.  There is another whole scene I can recall in which
Mountain
(Anthony Quinn) is practicing holds with a wrestler.  He asks that the
wrestler stay away from his injured eye, and when he purposely goes for
the
eye, Mountain punches his lights out.  The cuts I recall seeing on TV
years
ago always included these scenes, and I've never seen this shortened cut
of
the film before.  It's still a great film, but I really miss these two
scenes.

A sad, heartbreaking, and somewhat disturbing story. Quinn is totally
believable as Mountain Rivera, a boxer who, perhaps, has been in the
game too long and finds himself forced out. While his world-weary cut
man (Rooney) is protective of him to an extent, his manager (Gleason)
only views Rivera as a paycheck. An unemployment agency staff person
(Miller) sees something in Rivera that prompts him to go above and
beyond the call of duty to help him get a job. All of the leads are
extremely good. It appears that most of the film takes place in the
dark, highlighting the seamy side of boxing. The only daytime scene is
when Rivera visits the unemployment office, and even then, it appears
that the place has no windows to see outside. The office is just as
closed up and restricted as Rivera's limited choices after his career
ends. The actress who portrayed the underworld figure that Rivera's
manager has a connection to was appropriately evil and creepy. The very
last scene, filled with a sense of finality and resignation, is
powerful.

                   Anthony Quinn, Jackie Gleason and Mickey Rooney made this
film a great black and white film classic for all future generations. 
However,  as a young boy living in Richmond Hill, Queens during the 1940's,
I had Abe Simon (great prize fighter, who fought Joe Lewis) a neighbor who
lived down the street.  Abe Simon was an adviser for this film along with
Willie Pep (World Featherweight boxing Champion 1942-48/ 1949-50) Abe Simon
looked like a giant and had huge hands, but was a very kind and down to
earth person and well liked. Willie was also an adviser in this film for
Anthony Quinn and later became a bouncer in NYC.  These great boxer's gave
this film the great realism that it has and it was great to see them along
with another great boxer, Jack Dempsey, who owned a food establishment on
Broadway NYC.   This film clearly shows the horrible results of boxing in
the ring for a profession, however, all boxers and future boxers should be
praised for their great gifts in that field of endeavor.

******SPOILERS****** Getting knocked out by Cassius Clay in the seventh
round proved to be the end of the line for former heavyweight contender
Louis ""Mountain"" Rivera, Anthony Quinn. After the fight in Mountain's
dressing room the fight doctor checking the damage to his left eye
tells his manager and trainer Maish and Army, Jackie Gleason and Mickey
Rooney, that he can't allow Mountain to fight anymore. The next punch
to his head can very well bind or even kill him. <br><br>His brains scrambled his fists busted in danger of losing his eyesight
17 years in the fight game is all the battering that Mountain's body
could take. Now after 17 years it was time for Mountain to hang up his
boxing gloves and go into another line of work, but what kind of work
could Mountain do? Unknown to Mountain and his trainer Army his manager
Maish had given the Ma Greeny mob the word that his fighter won't last
more then 4 rounds with the young and hard hitting Cassius Clay and
they place a lot of money on the tip that Maish gave them. Mountain
going more then 4 rounds with Clay cost the Greeny mob big and it was
up to Maish to come up with the money by the end of the month or else
Maish won't ever have any need for money again. Without Mountain being
able to fight anymore the only way Maish can get the money for the
Greeny mob is for Mountain to become a professional wrestler and thus
making a joke of himself entertaining the public. This time instead of
taking punches Mountain will be taking laughs. <br><br>Rod Serling's hard hitting screen-play about the fight game and how it
chews up and spits out those who are in it like Louis ""Mountain"" Rivera
when it no longer has any use for them. Touching performance by Anthony
Quinn as the broken down Mountain who has to humiliate himself by being
a clown in the ring as a wrestler after being a proud warrior in the
ring as a boxer. Also very moving is Julie Harris as Grace Miller the
social worker who does her best to get Mountain a job as a youth
consular only to have him lose it by getting drunk celebrating getting
it.<br><br>As hard hitting as the punches thrown in the ring and as powerful as
those boxers in the ring taking them. Mountain makes a fool of himself
to save his crooked managers, Maish, hide so he could have the money to
pay back the mob that he owes them, but that ended his friendship with
Maish. It also educated Maish about being honest and loyal to those who
trust and depend on him which is something that he didn't know about up
till then. The film ends with Mountain swallowing his pride and
accepting what fate had in store for him.

Requiem for a Heavyweight is a great ensemble piece revolving around
four characters. It's a tribute to the skill of Rod Serling's
screenplay and the direction of Ralph Nelson that no one of them
dominates the story.<br><br>Anthony Quinn as Mountain Rivera has been given the final knockout by
the New York State Athletic Commission after a fight with up and coming
heavyweight, Cassius Clay. His eyes won't take too many more blows, so
his license is being pulled. He's got to look for another line of work,
but ring skills and a sixth grade education is all he has for the job
market. <br><br>If that wasn't enough, his manager Jackie Gleason made some bets and
got some other gamblers to bet that Quinn wouldn't stand up more than
three rounds under Clay's fists. The gamblers want their money. <br><br>What to do, Gleason thinks he can get him a gig as a wrestler, but the
idea of putting on an Indian suit offends his sensibilities. The whole
thing offends Mickey Rooney who is Quinn's corner man and Julie Harris,
an employment counselor, has different ideas all together for Quinn.<br><br>It's a bitter thing for Quinn to not only learn he's through at the
only thing he knows, but that his manager and friend doesn't even
believe in him any more. The rest of the film is devoted to how all of
the four of them will deal with a very bleak future.<br><br>Julie Harris does not get too many comments, but she has an interesting
role as a prim and sexually frustrated middle aged civil servant who
sees in Quinn some kind of personal reclamation project. Her life
however has not given her any perspective in dealing with the boxing
game and the people in it.<br><br>Gleason might have the bleakest future of all whether his gambling
debts are paid or not. This is probably Jackie Gleason's best dramatic
role and he's brilliant. For one thing he won't even have Mickey Rooney
around who acts as everybody's conscience. Rooney is another ex-fighter
who survives by tending to the cuts of competing pugilists and it's not
something he likes, but something he does well and it keeps him in the
only game he knows.<br><br>It all gets resolved, but not to everyone's liking in the end. Requiem
for a Heavyweight is a brilliant piece of acting about the underside of
the fight game and the bleak future that a lot who survive it have.

DO NOT MISS THIS FILM!<br><br>This film is a masterpiece which depicted the seamy side of low level
boxing at St. Nichols or ""St. Nicks"" Arena in Brooklyn, NY. The old
Stillman Gym shots show just how few ever made any money or fame before
being destroyed by too many punches to the head. Jackie Gleason
personified the low rent scum that rode any fighter to death. Rivera
was so hopelessly trapped that Anthony Quinn caught the essence of the
man and his slow descent into being a meal ticket for Gleason and a bad
joke in the wrestling game. Harris was brilliant as the NY Social
Worker and idealist. She caught the last glimmer of hope in Rivera and
tried to help but was defeated when he turned out to be hopelessly
owned by Gleason. Rooney was brilliant but I preferred Myron McCormick
in the TV film a few years earlier. Having been to St. Knicks as a kid,
I know the realness of this story because I saw them, smelled them and
felt for some of the dying, which is what most of them were doing. All
the stars in the world for this one.

This Rod Serling written story originally was televised on the old CBS
Playhouse 90 program which was live TV.  This film produced by David
Susskind sticks pretty much to the Playhouse 90 version with a few
variations and a couple of characters.  Anthony Quinn seems more like a
heavyweight than Jack Palance did for one thing and the individual that
Maish Rennick is in debt to is also more colorful than in the
Teleplay.
 Jackie Gleason, Mickey Rooney and Julie Harris are as good in their roles
as the actors who were in the Teleplay.  The ending is slightly different
and I found it to have more stark realism than the Teleplay.  Check out the
fighter that Mountain is in the ring with when the film starts.            <br><br>

Jackie Gleason is in his element as promoter/manager/trainer of a
broken down end-of-the-road boxer ""Mountain Rivera"" played brilliantly
by Anthony Quinn. After 17 punishing years getting battered in the Ring
""The Mountain"" sports the scars, brain paralysis and the ""shot"" hoarse
voice of an ex-fighter who is played to the hilt by Quinn. Mickey
Rooney as ""Mountain's"" trainer is also sensational in his role. The
whole cast in this film is simply fantastic. The writing of Rod Serling
(of ""Twilight Zone"" fame) is masterful to say the least. Julie Harris
who tries to provide hope for Rivera's future is beautifully and
""tenderly"" rendered on screen. The sleazy nature of the boxing business
in the seedy surroundings of the cockroach infested hotel rooms is
starkly defined in this black and white celluloid. There is a scene
with Mickey Rooney and Jackie Gleason playing cards reminiscent of ""The
Honeymooners"" with Art Carney when Gleason explodes in exasperation at
Rooney who delays playing his hand at ""gin"" rummy. This is a taut and
brilliantly portrayed film that everyone should see. Muhammed Ali (as
Cassius Clay) is hauntingly shot at the beginning of the film. Jack
Dempsey, the former heavyweight champ, is also shown at his restaurant
in New York. The corruption and fear in this business is tellingly
displayed. In fact this is a ""must see"" and ""must own"" kind of film. A
Knock Out! As an aside, Jackie Gleason was so great on film partly
because of his experience in live vaudeville shows. He grew up in
abject poverty as a boy. This forced him out at an early age to make a
living. The greatness came from hard times, talent and an insatiable
work ethic. Thus the great talent of Jackie Gleason began to shine to
the point of dethroning Milton Berle out of the top TV spot in 1954 as
""The Honeymooners"" stormed on screen. So many great talents from this
era developed in the same way. Poverty and hard times had a way of
producing talented star entertainers in the 30's and 40's. Perhaps this
explains the lack of talent on screen today.

The sport of professional boxing takes another beating in this tragic
and powerful re-make of the Rod Serling Playhouse 90 teleplay. The film
opens from the viewpoint of Mountain Rivera, a once ranked heavyweight,
being pummeled by a youthful Cassius Clay. Rivera loses the fight,
beaten so senseless that when asked where he is (NYC) he responds ""I'm
in Pittsburgh and its raining"". When the the fight doctor examines him
he makes it clear this broken down pug is all washed up. This puts his
manager Maish in a bind since he bet Mountain wouldn't get past the
fourth round with some thugs who also lost money because of his
guarantee. Maish needs cash fast and the only way he can get it is to
get his washed up fighter to wrestle. Rivera considers it degrading
(remember it's 1962) and refuses.<br><br>Requiem is top heavy with strong performances from its quartet of
leads. Jackie Gleason as sleazy Maish is given more to work with here
than his Oscar nominated Minnesota Fats. He's a desperate man, wracked
with guilt but ready to sell out Mountain to stay breathing. Mickey
Rooney gives probably his finest adult performance as Army, the trainer
who has Mountain's best interest at heart. Julie Harris as the social
worker assigned to find him employment seems incapable of giving
anything less than solid performances in everything she does and she
does not disappoint here. Then there is Anthony Quinn doing what he
does best but this time with a battered machismo that's barely holding
together. Body broken, dreams shattered, he is a combination of punchy
and naive; a hulking gruesome monster, but still a child inside. His
plight is uneasy to witness and Quinn in conveying it has never been
better.<br><br>Also deserving mention is night club owner and performer Madame Spivy
playing Ma, the hood owed money. Dressed in a man's trench coat and hat
she displays an offbeat menace with a clipped sardonic delivery that
makes more than clear she is a woman not to be trifled with.<br><br>Director Ralph Nelson keeps things claustrophobic and low lit to
emphasize the grim existence of the characters far from the big paydays
and glamor of pay per view in Vegas. Their futures seem about as bright
as the dark rooms they live in and the empty deserted streets they
walk.<br><br>While it may not rank as one of the great fight films of all

He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to Ann Harriet (Gunderson), a Norwegian immigrant, and James Thomas Mitchum, a shipyard/railroad worker. His father died in a train accident when he was two, and Robert and his siblings (including brother John Mitchum, later also an actor) were raised by his mother and stepfather (a British army major) in Connecticut, New York, and Delaware. An early contempt for authority led to discipline problems, and Mitchum spent good portions of his teen years adventuring on the open road. On one of these trips, at the age of 14, he was charged with vagrancy and sentenced to a Georgia chain gang, from which he escaped. Working a wide variety of jobs (including ghostwriter for astrologist Carroll Righter), Mitchum discovered acting in a Long Beach, California, amateur theater company. He worked at Lockheed Aircraft, where job stress caused him to suffer temporary blindness. About this time he began to obtain small roles in films, appearing in dozens within a very brief time. In 1945, he was cast as Lt. Walker in Story of G.I. Joe (1945) and received an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actor. His star ascended rapidly, and he became an icon of 1940s film noir, though equally adept at westerns and romantic dramas. His apparently lazy style and seen-it-all demeanor proved highly attractive to men and women, and by the 1950s, he was a true superstar despite a brief prison term for marijuana usage in 1949, which seemed to enhance rather than diminish his ""bad boy"" appeal. Though seemingly dismissive of ""art,"" he worked in tremendously artistically thoughtful projects such as Charles Laughton\'s The Night of the Hunter (1955) and even co-wrote and composed an oratorio produced at the Hollywood Bowl by Orson Welles. A master of accents and seemingly unconcerned about his star image, he played in both forgettable and unforgettable films with unswerving nonchalance, leading many to overlook the prodigious talent he can bring to a project that he finds compelling. He moved into television in the 1980s as his film opportunities diminished, winning new fans with The Winds of War (1983) and War and Remembrance (1988). His sons James Mitchum and Christopher Mitchum are actors, as is his grandson Bentley Mitchum. His last film was James Dean: Live Fast, Die Young (1997) with Casper Van Dien as James Dean.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Jim Beaver < jumblejim@prodigy.net>          Spouse (1) Dorothy Mitchum (15 March\xa01940            - 1 July\xa01997)\xa0(his death)\xa0(3 children)          Trade Mark (4)        On and off-screen, he was known for his facade of cool, sleepy-eyed indifference        Deep, commanding, yet lively voice        Dimpled chin        Often played loners and driftersTrivia (73)      Father of James Mitchum, Christopher Mitchum, and Trini Mitchum.

Briefly served in the United States Army during World War II, with service number 39 744 068, from April 12 - October 11, 1945, after he was drafted. According to Lee Server\'s 2001 biography, ""Robert Mitchum: Baby I Don\'t Care"", Mitchum said he served as a medic at an induction department, checking recruits\' genitals for venereal disease (a ""pecker checker""). Always the iconoclast, although he did not want to join the military, he served honorably and was discharged as a Private First Class and received the World War II Victory Medal.      Was one of four actors (with Jack Nicholson, Bette Davis, and Faye Dunaway) to have two villainous roles ranked in the American Film Institute\'s 100 years of The Greatest Heroes and Villains, as Max Cady in Cape Fear (1962) at #28 and as Reverend Harry Powell in The Night of the Hunter (1955) at #29.      He was accused of anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial after an interview he gave to Barry Rehfeld of ""Esquire"" magazine promoting The Winds of War (1983) at his home in February 1983. Mitchum wrote an apologetic letter on 9 March 1983 to Herbert Luft, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency\'s Hollywood columnist. Mitchum claimed he had recited views expressed by the bigoted football coach he had played in That Championship Season (1982), which Rehfeld ""mistakenly believed to be my own. From that point on, he approached me as the character in the script and in playing the devil\'s advocate in a prankish attempt to string him along we compounded a tragedy of errors."" Mitchum added he was ""truly sorry that this misunderstanding has upset so many people, especially since it is so foreign to my principle. The attendant misfortune is that it has brought me a spate of mail from people and organizations who are encouraged to believe that I share their bigotry and discrimination."".      Carefully maintained a facade of indifference, always lazily insisting that he made movies just so he could get laid, score some pot, and make money, and cared nothing about art. This is surely true of some films, which he likely picked to make money, but certain directors and films seemed to secretly pique his interest, including his work with Charles Laughton, John Huston and Howard Hawks.      He was voted the 61st Greatest Movie Star of all time by Entertainment Weekly.      Was mentioned by name as part of The Velvet Underground song ""New Age"" (from the 1970 album ""Loaded"").      In the 1950s, he was selected by Howard Hughes to appear in a series of films he was producing. Hughes considered Mitchum a ""friend,"" but (as a paranoid recluse) hardly met the actor. Mitchum was halfway put off and halfway amused by the ""crazy old man"" and clearly saw that he was a surrogate for Hughes as the strapping actor ""romanced"" young starlets on screen.Michael Madsen called Mitchum his ""role model"" and inspiration to take up acting as a profession.      Was close friends with Richard Egan, and served as a pallbearer at his funeral in 1987.      Was named #23 greatest actor on The 50 Greatest Screen Legends by the American Film Institute.      Great-grandfather of Allexanne Mitchum, Cappy Van Dien and Grace Van Dien.      Turned down the lead role of Gen. George S. Patton in Patton (1970), allegedly because he believed he would ruin the film due to his indifference. During a Turner Classic Movies interview with Robert Osborne, Mitchum said that he knew the movie could be a great one due to the script, but that the studio would want to concentrate on battles and tanks moving around on screen rather than on the character of Patton. Mitchum believed that with himself in the role, the movie would turn out mediocre; what was needed was a passionate actor who would fight his corner to keep the focus on Patton, an actor like George C. Scott, whom Mitchum recommended to the producers.      Treated for alcoholism at the Betty Ford Center in 1984.      Died one day before his The Big Sleep (1978) co-star James Stewart.      Biography in: ""American National Biography."" Supplement 1, pp. 414-416. New York: Oxford University Press, 2002.      Although he had numerous affairs throughout his marriage, he remained with wife Dorothy Mitchum for nearly 60 years.      Addressed the Republican National Convention in 1992.      Robert\'s father, James Thomas Mitchum, was born in Lane, Williamsburg, South Carolina. James had English ancestry. Robert\'s mother, Ann Harriet (Gunderson), was Norwegian, from Kristiania, Oslo, Norway. Robert is sometimes described as having Native American ancestry on his father\'s side. It is not clear if this ancestry has been verified/documented.      He was cremated and his ashes scattered at sea by wife Dorothy Mitchum and neighbor Jane Russell. At Mitchum\'s insistence, no memorial service was held.      His driving license from 1950 gave his height as 6\' even, one inch less than usually reported. However, Mitchum described himself as being exactly six feet tall in interviews.      His vocal support for the Vietnam War failed to affect his appeal with American youth, and in 1968, a poll of teenagers declared him the coolest celebrity. Mitchum responded that they must have missed his recent films.      During a break in filming War and Remembrance (1988) in August 1987, Mitchum replaced his friend John Huston as an aging millionaire in Mr. North (1988) after Huston, who suffered from emphysema, was hospitalized with pneumonia. In October 1987, Mitchum filled in for Edward Woodward, who was recovering from a heart attack, in a special two-part episode of The Equalizer (1985).      His arrest for marijuana possession in the late 1940s was one of the first times a major actor had been jailed for this crime. According to Lee Server\'s 2001 biography, ""Robert Mitchum: Baby I Don\'t Care"", he was still smoking pot into his old age.      Was the defendant in FTC (Federal Taxation Commissioner) vs. Mitchum (1965), a famous taxation case in Australia, in relation to income earned in Australia while working there on The Sundowners (1960).      He was a huge fan of Elvis Presley\'s early music, and wanted Presley to star with him in Thunder Road (1958). Unfortunately, Tom Parker\'s demands for Presley\'s salary could not be met in this independent production, which Mitchum was financing himself.      In 1981, he fired his secretary, Reva Frederick, when he closed his office. Mitchum was subsequently sued as she claimed he owed her a pension back-dated to 1961. There was no paperwork to support this claim, and she dropped her suit when evidence was discovered that she had stolen millions of dollars from Mitchum over the years. As part of the ""deal"", he agreed not to prosecute. During the course of these events, Ms. Fredrick suffered a stroke from which she never fully recovered.      He was persuaded by his manager Antonio Consentino, a die-hard Republican, to campaign for George Bush in the 1992 presidential election. He also narrated a biographical film of the President for the Republican National Convention, and attended a fundraiser at Bob Hope\'s house in Hollywood.      His performance as Reverend Harry Powell in The Night of the Hunter (1955) is ranked #71 on Premiere magazine\'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.      Mitchum once said that Reverend Harry Powell, the murderous villain he played in The Night of the Hunter (1955), was his favorite role.      He seriously considered retiring from acting in 1968 due to concerns over the quality of his recent movies. After a year\'s absence, during which he spent much of the time driving around America visiting old friends and staying in motels, he was lured back to star in Ryan\'s Daughter (1970).      Visited his son Christopher Mitchum on the set of Rio Lobo (1970). Director Howard Hawks asked the elder Mitchum to reprise his El Dorado (1967) role as a drunken sheriff, but Mitchum claimed he was now retired. John Wayne responded, ""Mitch has been retiring ever since the first day I met him."".      He was fired from Blood Alley (1955), allegedly for getting drunk and arguing with a crew member whom he then proceeded to throw into a nearby river, a charge Mitchum always denied.      Turned down the leading role in Sam Peckinpah\'s masterpiece The Wild Bunch (1969), which went to his old friend William Holden, and made 5 Card Stud (1968). His excuse was they were both westerns.5 Card Stud (1968), the showdown between Hollywood\'s two deities of indifference, produced no sparks on or off the screen. Dean Martin remained in his trailer watching television after filming was completed, and delivered his lines as though he had memorized them phonetically. The only excitement came when a massive camera collapsed and nearly hammered Mitchum into the ground. Instead, the star moved casually aside while thousands of dollars worth of equipment smashed around him.      Had a longstanding dislike of fellow tough guy actors Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson.      President Dwight D. Eisenhower would never allow any of Mitchum\'s movies to be played in the White House, due to the actor\'s marijuana possession conviction.      Replaced Burt Lancaster in Maria\'s Lovers (1984) after the elder actor was forced to undergo emergency quadruple heart bypass surgery.      After two weeks of shooting on the movie Tombstone (1993), the studio fired writer (director) Kevin Jarre and hired George P. Cosmatos. He, with Kurt Russell\'s input, cut a number of scenes (for actors) and changed them to new action scenes, weakening a beautifully written script. Part of what was cut was the old man Ike\'s character. As Mitchum had already signed the contract, they had him do the voice-over instead.      Though respectful of Robert De Niro\'s talent, Mitchum was amused by the young Method actor\'s habit of remaining in character all day as film studio chief Monroe Stahr during the filming of The Last Tycoon (1976). Mitchum gave De Niro the nickname ""Kid Monroe"", and made many jokes about him with the older actors on the set like Ray Milland and Dana Andrews.      Many critics were unconvinced by the 65-year-old Mitchum winning World War II in The Winds of War (1983). When the producers made a sequel, War and Remembrance (1988), they worried that a 70-year-old Mitchum would be even less convincing and considered replacing him with James Coburn. Eventually they decided that what they would gain in fewer wrinkles, they would lose in Mitchum\'s formidable screen presence and charisma.      Presented with a People\'s Choice Award backstage by Charlton Heston for War and Remembrance (1988) during the 1989 ceremony in Beverly Hills, California.      Turned down Gene Hackman\'s role as drug-busting policeman Popeye Doyle in The French Connection (1971) because he found the story offensive.      While filming El Dorado (1967) Mitchum was amused by co-star John Wayne\'s attempts to play his screen persona to the hilt in real life. He recalled that Wayne wore four-inch lifts to increase his height and had the roof of his car raised so he could drive wearing his Stetson.      Mitchum was in poor health while filming The Winds of War (1983), and once again there was talk of retirement. He filmed Maria\'s Lovers (1984) despite suffering from a solid case of pneumonia.      He claimed his famous eyes were the result of a combination of injuries from his boxing days and chronic insomnia, which he suffered from throughout his life.      In 1959, the Mitchums moved out of Hollywood and into a farm they had bought on the Maryland shore of Chesapeake Bay, near the town of Trappe. In 1965, the family returned to Hollywood, largely at wife Dorothy Mitchum\'s insistence, and moved into a modest, ivy-covered mansion in Bel Air. Mitchum also purchased a 76-acre ranch near Los Angeles, mostly as a home for his growing collection of quarter horses.      The 60-year-old Mitchum impressed Oliver Reed, Britain\'s legendary hellraiser, by drinking a whole bottle of gin in 55 minutes on the set of The Big Sleep (1978).      Is mentioned in the Queens of the Stone Age song ""The Fun Machine Took a Shit and Died"", off their 2007 album ""Era Vulgaris"".      Early in his career many newspapers and fan magazines promoted him as a ""new"" Clark Gable, perhaps because both actors had strongly masculine images and powerful, distinctive voices. With Out of the Past (1947) however, Mitchum proved that he was a great star in his own right.      Was mentioned in the song ""One More Arrow"" by Elton John.      Was the inspiration for the Kurt Busiek\'s Astro City character ""Steeljack"".      Is the subject of the song ""Robert Mitchum"" by Swedish singer Olle Ljungström, available on his album ""Världens Räddaste Man"" (translates ""The World\'s Most Terrified Man"").      Mitchum was cast by Howard Hughes in Holiday Affair (1949) because Hughes felt that Mitchum needed to ""soften"" his image after his marijuana conviction and prison sentence.      Turned down the role that eventually went to Tony Curtis in The Defiant Ones (1958). Mitchum, a real-life veteran of a Southern chain gang, did not believe the premise that a black man and a white man would be chained together and said that such a thing would never happen in the South. Over the years, this reason was corrupted to the point where many people now believe Mitchum turned down the role because he did not want to be chained to a black man, an absolute falsehood. Curtis repeated the inaccurate story in his autobiography, but later recanted after Mitchum\'s real reason was explained to him.      Dwight Whitney wrote in ""TV Guide"" on June 7, 1969 about Mitchum that there is the ""suggestion, implicit in every utterance, that within the body of this \'movie-star\' lies imprisoned the soul of a poet."".      According to Mitchum biographer John Belton, during the shooting of Undercurrent (1946) Katharine Hepburn told Mitchum, ""You know you can\'t act, and if you hadn\'t been good-looking, you would have never gotten a picture. I\'m tired of playing with people who have nothing to offer."".      As a teenager, Mitchum was sentenced to a Georgia chain gang on a charge of vagrancy.      Was announced as co star with Spencer Tracy and Paul Newman in the Jerry Wald production of ""The Enemy Within"", based on the book by Attorney General Robert Kennedy, which at 1962/63 was in preparation for Twentieth Century Fox.      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6240 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on January 25, 1984.      As of November 2013, Mitchum remains the subject of a documentary, still in progress after some 20 years, by Bruce Weber, which was screened at the Venice Film Festival in August 2013.      While at RKO Radio Pictures, Mitchum became the first male movie star to refuse to shave his chest for shirtless roles. In order to avoid that, he allowed himself to develop a pot belly to avoid having to take his shirt off at all.      Mitchum refused to be interviewed for George Eells\' biography of the actor.      In 1975 he was offered his high school diploma if he attended a ceremony at his old school. Mitchum did not attend the ceremony, but the diploma was still posted to him.      Became good friends with legendary animal trainer Ralph Helfer\'s famous African Lion Zamba while filming the movie Rampage (1963).      One of the lesser-known aspects of Mitchum\'s career were his forays into music, both as singer and composer. Critic Greg Adams writes that ""Unlike most celebrity vocalists, Robert Mitchum actually had musical talent."" Mitchum\'s voice was often used instead of that of a professional singer when his character sang in his films. Notable productions featuring Mitchum\'s own singing voice included Rachel and the Stranger (1948), River of No Return (1954) and The Night of the Hunter (1955). After hearing traditional calypso music and meeting artists such as Mighty Sparrow and Lord Invader while filming Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison (1957) in the Caribbean island of Tobago, he recorded Calypso - is like so... in 1957. On the album, he emulated the calypso sound and style, even adopting the style\'s unique pronunciations and slang. A year later, he recorded a song he had written for the film Thunder Road (1958), titled ""The Ballad of Thunder Road"". The country-style song became a modest hit for Mitchum, reaching No. 69 on the Billboard Pop Singles Chart. The song was included as a bonus track on a successful reissue of Calypso... and helped market the film to a wider audience.      Was said to have been a candidate for the role of Samson in Samson and Delilah (1949).      Mitchum wrote an oratorio that was produced and directed by Orson Welles at the Hollywood Bowl in the 1940s.      In his 1973 autobiography ""Anything for a Quiet Life"" Jack Hawkins wrote that Mitchum would drink 49 glasses of rum before having dinner when they were filming Rampage (1963).Personal Quotes (56)      The only difference between me and my fellow actors is that I\'ve spent more time in jail.      I gave up being serious about making pictures around the time I made a film with Greer Garson and she took a hundred and twenty-five takes to say no.      I started out to be a sex fiend but couldn\'t pass the physical.      Movies bore me; especially my own.      I\'ve still got the same attitude I had when I started. I haven\'t changed anything but my underwear.      [on his acting talents] Listen. I got three expressions: looking left, looking right and looking straight ahead.      People think I have an interesting walk. Hell, I\'m just trying to hold my gut in.      [on press stories] They\'re all true - booze, brawls, broads, all true. Make up some more if you want to.      When I drop dead and they rush to the drawer, there\'s going to be nothing in it but a note saying \'later\'.      I never take any notice of reviews - unless a critic has thought up some new way of describing me. That old one about my lizard eyes and anteater nose and the way I sleep my way through pictures is so hackneyed now.      Years ago, I saved up a million dollars from acting, a lot of money in those days, and I spent it all on a horse farm in Tucson. Now when I go down there, I look at that place and I realize my whole acting career adds up to a million dollars worth of horse shit.      I have two acting styles: with and without a horse.      Every two or three years, I knock off for a while. That way I\'m always the new girl in the whorehouse.      I never changed anything, except my socks and my underwear. And I never did anything to glorify myself or improve my lot. I took what came and did the best I could with it.      [asked what jail was like, after being released on a marijuana possession charge] It\'s like Palm Springs without the riff-raff.      You\'ve got to realize that a Steve McQueen performance lends itself to monotony.      Not that I\'m a complete whore, understand. There are movies I won\'t do for any amount. I turned down Patton (1970) and I turned down Dirty Harry (1971). Movies that piss on the world. If I\'ve got five bucks in my pocket, I don\'t need to make money that f***ing way, daddy.John Wayne had four-inch lifts in his shoes. He had the overheads on his boat accommodated to fit him. He had a special roof put in his station wagon. The son-of-a-bitch, they probably buried him in his goddamn lifts.      There just isn\'t any pleasing some people. The trick is to stop trying.      [his opinion about the Vietnam war, in 1968] If they won\'t listen to reason over there, just kill \'em. Nuke \'em all.      Sure I was glad to see John Wayne win the Oscar. I\'m always glad to see the fat lady win the Cadillac on television, too.      I\'ve survived because I work cheap and don\'t take up too much time.      You know what the average Robert Mitchum fan is? He\'s full of warts and dandruff and he\'s probably got a hernia too, but he sees me up there on the screen and he thinks if that bum can make it, I can be president.      I kept the same suit for six years - and the same dialog. We just changed the title of the picture and the leading lady.      I came back from the war and ugly heroes were in.      Young actors love me. They think if that big slob can make it, there\'s a chance for us.      [asked why, in his mid-60s, he took on the arduous task of an 18-hour mini-series, The Winds of War (1983)] It promised a year of free lunches.      How do I keep fit? I lay down a lot.      [on four-time co-star Deborah Kerr] The best, my favorite... Life would be kind if I could live it with Deborah around.      [his opinion of Method actors Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Jack Nicholson] They are all small.      [1983] Stars today are just masturbation images.      [on The Good Guys and the Bad Guys (1969)] How the hell did I get into this picture anyway? I kept reading in the papers that I was going to do it, but when they sent me the script I just tossed it on the heap with the rest of them. But somehow, one Monday morning, here I was. How the hell do these things happen to a man?      Just after we shot Secret Ceremony (1968), lesbianism came in... I\'m no damned good as a lesbian.      People make too much of acting. You are not helping anyone like being a doctor or even a musician. In the final analysis, you have exalted no one but yourself.      These kids only want to talk about acting method and motivation; in my day all we talked about was screwing and overtime.      I know production values are better, but are the scripts, are the pictures? The thing is, it\'s a hell of a lot more work, and I don\'t see overall where the films are any better, really?      I often regret my good reviews, because there is no point in doing something I know to be inferior and then I find I have come off the best in the film. Wouldn\'t you find that worrying?      [1948] I never will believe there is such a thing as a great actor.      I got a great life out of the movies. I\'ve been all over the world and met the most fantastic people. I don\'t really deserve all I\'ve gotten. It\'s a privileged life, and I know it.      Sometimes, I think I ought to go back and do at least one thing really well. But again, indolence will probably cause me to hesitate about finding a place to start. Part of that indolence perhaps is due to shyness because I\'m a natural hermit. I\'ve been in constant motion of escape all my life. I never really found the right corner to hide in.      Up there on the screen you\'re thirty feet wide, your eyeball is six feet high, but it doesn\'t mean that you really amount to anything or have anything important to say.      [1967] Where are the real artists? Today it\'s four-barreled carburetors and that\'s it.      [1968] The Rin Tin Tin method is good enough for me. That dog never worried about motivation or concepts and all that junk.      I only read the reviews of my films if they\'re amusing. Six books have been written about me but I\'ve only met two of the authors. They get my name and birthplace wrong in the first paragraph. From there it\'s all downhill.      [on working with Faye Dunaway] When I got here I walked in thinking I was a star and then I found I was supposed to do everything the way she says. Listen, I\'m not going to take any temperamental whims from anyone, I just take a long walk and cool off. If I didn\'t do that, I know I\'d wind up dumping her on her derrière.      [on Sarah Miles] She\'s a monster. If you think she\'s not strong, you\'d better pay attention.      [asked what he looks for in a script before accepting a job] Days off.      [on Steve McQueen] He sure don\'t bring much brains to the party, that kid.      [on Jane Russell] Miss Russell was a very strong character. Very good-humored when she wasn\'t being cranky.      They think I don\'t know my lines. That\'s not true. I\'m just too drunk to say \'em.      They could never decide to their satisfaction what type I was. One would say, ""He\'s a heart-broken Byronic."" Another would say, ""No, he ain\'t; he\'s an all-American boy."" People began talking about Mitchum-type roles, but I still don\'t know what they mean. They\'d paint eyes on my eyelids, man, and I\'d walk through it.      RKO made the same film with me for ten years. They were so alike I wore the same suit in six of them and the same Burberry trench coat. They made a male Jane Russell out of me. I was the staff hero. They got so they wanted me to take some of my clothes off in the pictures. I objected to this, so I put on some weight and looked like a Bulgarian wrestler when I took my shirt off. Only two pictures in that time made any sense whatever. I complained and they told me frankly that they had a certain amount of baloney to sell and I was the boy to do it.      I worked three pictures for 28 days straight. We\'d shoot all night at RKO [The Locket (1946)], then I\'d report to Undercurrent (1946) from seven in the morning until noon, when I\'d be flown to Monterey to work all afternoon with Greer Garson [Desire Me (1947)].      I get along with people very well, really. I do. I do. Really. Every now and then, some guy gets the hots and figures to go home and tell his old lady he just decked that motherfucker Mitchum. Why, she\'ll shoot him, man! ""Robert Mitchum? You stomped his ass? Why, you dirty motherfucker!"" Me, I\'m easy. I don\'t go through red lights. I don\'t steal.      The single thing I\'m grateful for that\'s come out of the whole [Vietnam] war mess has been the recognition of the need for communication. I\'ve gone sometimes on dangerous waters in the interest of communication because I believe in it. I believe that everyone in the world should at least have the privilege of knowing what\'s happening all at the same time. One thing I\'ve learned is that the greatest fuckin\' slavery is ignorance, and the biggest commodity is ignorance -- the dissemination of ignorance, the sale and burgeoning marketing of ignorance.      No, I don\'t identify in my mind with criminals, but my exposure to them has helped my understanding. Oh, sure, sure, sure, sure. Sure. I know the freakers, you know -- the burglars, the uptighters, those creeps who puke or jerk off or something every time they make a score, so you can pick up on their modus operandi.Salary (20)Hoppy Serves a Writ\xa0(1943)      $100 /week      Aerial Gunner\xa0(1943)      $75 /day      Border Patrol\xa0(1943)      $100 /week      Minesweeper\xa0(1943)      $75 /day      Story of G.I.

Her mother Gladys Pearl Baker was a film-cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. Marilyn\'s father\'s identity was never known. Because Gladys was mentally and financially unable to care for young Marilyn, Gladys placed her in the care of a foster family, The Bolenders. Although the Bolender family wanted to adopt Marilyn, Gladys was eventually able to stabilize her lifestyle and took Marilyn back in her care when Marilyn was 7 years old. However, shortly after regaining custody of Marilyn, Gladys had a complete mental breakdown and was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and was committed to a state mental hospital. Gladys spent the rest of her life going in and out of hospitals and did not have contact with Marilyn ever again. Gladys outlived her daughter, dying in 1984.Marilyn was then taken in by Gladys\' best friend Grace Goddard, who, after a series of foster homes, placed Marilyn into the Los Angeles Orphan\'s Home in 1935. Marilyn was traumatized by her experience there despite the Orphan\'s Home being an adequate living facility. Grace Goddard eventually took Marilyn back to live with her in 1937 although this stay did not last long as Grace\'s husband began molesting Marilyn. Marilyn went to live with Grace\'s Aunt Ana after this incident, although due to Aunt Ana\'s advanced age she could not care properly for Marilyn. Marilyn once again for the third time had to return to live with the Goddard\'s. The Goddard\'s planned to relocated and according to law, could not take Marilyn with them. She only had two choices: return to the orphanage or get married. Marilyn was only 16 years old.She decided to marry a neighborhood friend named James Dougherty; he went into the military, she modeled, they divorced in 1946. She owned 200 books (including Tolstoy, Whitman, Milton), listened to Beethoven records, studied acting at the Actors\' lab in Hollywood, and took literature courses at UCLA downtown. 20th Century Fox gave her a contract but let it lapse a year later. In 1948, Columbia gave her a six-month contract, turned her over to coach Natasha Lytess and featured her in the B movie Ladies of the Chorus (1948) in which she sang three numbers : ""Every Baby Needs a Da Da Daddy"", ""Anyone Can Tell I Love You"" and ""The Ladies of the Chorus"" with Adele Jergens (dubbed by Virginia Rees) and others. Joseph L. Mankiewicz saw her in a small part in The Asphalt Jungle (1950) and put her in All About Eve (1950), resulting in 20th Century re-signing her to a seven-year contract. Niagara (1953) and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) launched her as a sex symbol superstar.When she went to a supper honoring her in the The Seven Year Itch (1955), she arrived in a red chiffon gown borrowed from the studio (she had never owned a gown). That same year, she married and divorced baseball great Joe DiMaggio (their wedding night was spent in Paso Robles, California). After The Seven Year Itch (1955), she wanted serious acting to replace the sexpot image and went to New York\'s Actors Studio. She worked with director Lee Strasberg and also underwent psychoanalysis to learn more about herself. Critics praised her transformation in Bus Stop (1956) and the press was stunned by her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller. True to form, she had no veil to match her beige wedding dress so she dyed one in coffee; he wore one of the two suits he owned. They went to England that fall where she made The Prince and the Showgirl (1957) with Laurence Olivier, fighting with him and falling further prey to alcohol and pills. Two miscarriages and gynecological surgery followed. So did an affair with Yves Montand. Work on her last picture The Misfits (1961), written for her by departing husband Miller was interrupted by exhaustion. She was dropped from the unfinished Something\'s Got to Give (1962) due to chronic lateness and drug dependency.On August 4, 1962, Marilyn Monroe\'s day began with threatening phone calls. Dr. Ralph Greenson, Marilyn\'s physician, came over the following day and quoted later in a document ""felt it was possible that Marilyn Monroe had felt rejected by some of the people she had been close to"". Apart from being upset that her publicist slept too long, she seemed fine. Pat Newcombe, who had stayed the previous night at Marilyn\'s house, left in the early evening as did Greenson who had a dinner date. Marilyn was upset he couldn\'t stay, and around 7:30pm she telephoned him while she was to tell him that her second husband\'s son had called him. Peter Lawford also called Marilyn, inviting her to dinner, but she declined. Lawford later said her speech was slurred. As the dark and depressing evening for Marilyn wore on there were other phone calls, including one from Jose Belanos, who said he thought she sounded fine. According to the funeral directors, Marilyn died sometime between 9:30pm and 11:30pm. Her maid unable to raise her but seeing a light under her locked door, called the police shortly after midnight. She also phoned Ralph Greenson who, on arrival, could not break down the bedroom door. He eventually broke in through French windows and found Marilyn dead in bed. The coroner stated she had died from acute barbiturate poisoning, and it was a \'probable suicide\'.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Ed Stephan <stephan@cc.wwu.edu>                    Probably the most celebrated of all actresses, Marilyn Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson on June 1, 1926, in the charity ward of the Los Angeles General Hospital. Prior to her birth, Marilyn\'s father bought a motorcycle and headed north to San Francisco, abandoning the family in Los Angeles. Marilyn grew up not knowing for sure who her father really was. Her mother, Gladys, had entered into several relationships, further confusing her daughter as to who it was who fathered her. Afterward, Gladys gave Norma Jeane (Marilyn) the name of Baker, a boyfriend she had before Mortenson. Poverty was a constant companion to Gladys and Norma. Gladys, who was extremely attractive and worked for RKO Studios as a filmcutter, suffered from mental illness and was in and out of mental institutions for the rest of her life, and because of that Norma Jeane spent time in foster homes. When she was nine, she was placed in an orphanage where she was to stay for the next two years. Upon being released from the orphanage, she went to yet another foster home. In 1942, at age 16, Norma Jeane married 21-year-old aircraft plant worker James Dougherty. The marriage only lasted four years, and they divorced in 1946. By this time, Marilyn began to model swimsuits and bleached her hair blonde. Various shots made their way into the public eye, where some were eventually seen by RKO Pictures head Howard Hughes. He offered Marilyn a screen test, but an agent suggested that 20th Century-Fox would be the better choice for her, since it was a much bigger and more prestigious studio. She was signed to a contract at $125 per week for a six-month period and that was increased by $25 per week at the end of that time when her contract was lengthened.Her first film was in 1947 with a bit part in The Shocking Miss Pilgrim (1947). Her next production was not much better, a bit in the eminently forgettable Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay! (1948). Two of the three brief scenes in which she appeared wound up on the cutting room floor. Later that same year, she was given a somewhat better role as Evie in Dangerous Years (1947). However, Fox declined to renew her contract, so she went back to modeling and acting school.Columbia Pictures then picked her up to play Peggy Martin in Ladies of the Chorus (1948), where she sang two numbers. Notices from the critics were favorable for her, if not the film, but Columbia dropped her. Once again Marilyn returned to modeling. In 1949, she appeared in United Artists\' Love Happy (1949). It was also that same year she posed nude for the now famous calendar shot which was later to appear in Playboy magazine in 1953 and further boost her career. She would be the first centerfold in that magazine\'s long and illustrious history. The next year proved to be a good year for Marilyn. She appeared in five films, but the good news was that she received very good notices for her roles in two of them, The Asphalt Jungle (1950) from MGM and All About Eve (1950) from Fox. Even though both roles were basically not much more than bit parts, movie fans remembered her dizzy but very sexy blonde performance.In 1951, Marilyn got a fairly sizable role in Love Nest (1951). The public was now getting to know her and liked what it saw. She had an intoxicating quality of volcanic sexuality wrapped in an aura of almost childlike innocence. In 1952, Marilyn appeared in Don\'t Bother to Knock (1952), in which she played a somewhat mentally unbalanced babysitter. Critics didn\'t particularly care for her work in this picture, but she made a much more favorable impression later in the year in Monkey Business (1952), where she was seen for the first time as a platinum blonde, a look that became her trademark. The next year, she appeared in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) as Lorelei Lee. It was also the same year she began dating the baseball great Joe DiMaggio.Marilyn was now a genuine box-office drawing card. Later, she appeared with Betty Grable, Lauren Bacall and Rory Calhoun in How to Marry a Millionaire (1953). Although her co-stars got the rave reviews, it was the sight of Marilyn that really excited the audience, especially the male members. On Thursday, January 14th, 1954, Marilyn wed DiMaggio, then proceeded to film There\'s No Business Like Show Business (1954). That was quickly followed by The Seven Year Itch (1955), which showcased her considerable comedic talent and contained what is arguably one of the most memorable moments in cinema history: Marilyn standing above a subway grating and the wind from a passing subway blowing her white dress up.By October 1954, Marilyn announced her divorce from DiMaggio. The union lasted only eight months. In 1955, she was suspended by Fox for not reporting for work on How to Be Very, Very Popular (1955). It was her second suspension, the first being for not reporting for the production of The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955). Both roles went to others. Her work was slowing down, due to her habit of being continually late to the set, her illnesses (whether real or imagined) and generally being unwilling to cooperate with her producers, directors, and fellow actors.However in Bus Stop (1956), Marilyn finally showed critics that she could play a straight dramatic role. It was also the same year she married playwright, Arthur Miller (they divorced in 1960). In 1957, Marilyn flew to Britain to film The Prince and the Showgirl (1957) which proved less than impressive critically and financially. It made money, but many critics panned it for being slow-moving. After a year off in 1958, Marilyn returned to the screen the next year for the delightful comedy, Some Like It Hot (1959) with Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. The film was an absolute smash hit, with Curtis and Lemmon pretending to be females in an all-girl band, so they can get work. This was to be Marilyn\'s only film for the year.In 1960, Marilyn appeared in George Cukor\'s Let\'s Make Love (1960), with Tony Randall and Yves Montand. Again, while it made money, it was critically panned as stodgy and slow-moving. The following year, Marilyn made what was to be her final film. The Misfits (1961), which also proved to be the final film for the legendary Clark Gable, who died later that year of a heart attack. The film was popular with critics and the public alike. In 1962, Marilyn was chosen to star in Fox\'s Something\'s Got to Give (1962). Again, her absenteeism caused delay after delay in production, resulting in her being fired from the production in June of that year. It looked as though her career was finished. Studios just didn\'t want to take a chance on her because it would cost them thousands of dollars in delays. She was only 36 years old.Marilyn made only 30 films in her lifetime, but her legendary status and mysticism will remain with film history forever.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Denny Jackson          Spouse (3) Arthur Miller (29 June\xa01956            - 20 January\xa01961)\xa0(divorced)           Joe DiMaggio (14 January\xa01954            - 31 October\xa01955)\xa0(divorced)           James Dougherty (19 June\xa01942            - 13 September\xa01946)\xa0(divorced)          Trade Mark (4)        Lisp, breathless voice        Platinum blonde hair        Voluptuous figure        Beauty spot on cheekTrivia (134)      Voted \'Sexiest Woman of the Century\' by People Magazine. [1999]      Was 1947\'s Miss California Artichoke Queen.      In her autobiography, ""My Story"", ghost-written by Ben Hecht, she recounted her guardian told her she was a direct descendant of James Monroe. Her mother\'s maiden name was Monroe, but there is no evidence she was a descendant of the U.S. President.      Was roommates with Shelley Winters when they were both starting out in Hollywood.      Ranked #8 in Empire (UK) magazine\'s ""The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time"" list. [October 1997]      Voted Empire\'s (UK) ""sexiest female movie star of all time"" in 1995.      She was Playboy\'s first ""Sweetheart of the Month"" in December 1953.      When she died in 1962 at age 36, she left an estate valued at $1.6 million. In her will, Monroe bequeathed 75% of that estate to Lee Strasberg, her acting coach, and 25% to Dr. Marianne Kris, her psychoanalyst. A trust fund provided her mother, Gladys Baker Eley, with $5,000 a year. When Dr. Kris died in 1980, she passed her 25% on to the Anna Freud Centre, a children\'s psychiatric institute in London. Since Strasberg\'s death in 1982, his 75% has been administered by his widow, Anna, and her lawyer, Irving Seidman.      The licensing of Marilyn\'s name and likeness, handled world-wide by Curtis Management Group, reportedly nets the Monroe estate about $2 million a year.      Was named the Number One Sex Star of the 20th Century by Playboy magazine in 1999.      Started using the name Marilyn Monroe in 1946, but did not legally change it until 1956.      Appeared on the first cover of Playboy in 1953.      Given a dog she named Tippy by foster father Albert Bolender. In her final, unfinished film Something\'s Got to Give (1962), the dog was also named Tippy.      Interred at Westwood Memorial Park, Los Angeles, California, USA, in the Corridor of Memories, crypt #24.      Hundreds of items of memorabilia auctioned off in late October 1999 by Christie\'s, with her infamous \'JFK\' birthday-gown fetching over $1 million.      Chosen by Empire magazine as one of the 100 Sexiest Stars in film history (#2). [1995]Hugh M. Hefner owns the closest burial vault next to hers.      She was discovered dead at her home at 12305 Fifth Helena Drive, Brentwood, California. She had a phone in one of her hands, her body was completely nude and face down, on her bed.      Ex-husband Joe DiMaggio put fresh roses at her memorial site, for numerous years after her death.      When putting her imprints at Grauman\'s she joked that Jane Russell was best known for her large front-side and she was known for her wiggly walk, so Jane could lean over, and she could sit in it. It was only a joke, but she dotted the ""I"" in her name with a rhinestone, which was stolen within days.      Redheaded actress Tina Louise played the character role of Ginger Grant on the television series Gilligan\'s Island (1964), was loosely based on her personality, but a different hair color.      Her first modeling job paid only five dollars.      Frequently used Nivea moisturizer.      During the filming of Niagara (1953), she was still under contract as a stock actor, thus, she received less salary than her make-up man. This was also the only film in which her character died. The film was reworked to highlight her after Anne Bancroft withdrew.      Often carried around the book, ""The Biography of Abraham Lincoln.""      Was an outstanding player on the Hollygrove Orphanage softball team.      Because the bathing suit she wore in the movie Love Nest (1951) was so risque (for the time period) and caused such a commotion on the set, director Joseph M. Newman had to make it a closed set when she was filming.      Fearing blemishes and sweat, she washed her face fifteen times a day.      She was suggested as a possible wife for Prince Rainier of Monaco. But he picked actress, Grace Kelly, to be his wife.      Thought the right side of her face was her ""best"" side.      The first time she signed an autograph as Marilyn Monroe, she had to ask how to spell it. She didn\'t know where to put the ""i"" in ""Marilyn"".      Born on Tuesday at 9:30 AM, Pacific Standard Time, which is Los Angeles, California\'s time zone.      Suffered from endometriosis, a condition in which tissues of the uterus lining (endometrium) leave the uterus, attach themselves to other areas of the body, and grow, causing pain, irregular bleeding, and, in severe cases, infertility.      Divorced first husband, James Dougherty, in Las Vegas, Nevada.      Divorced last husband, Arthur Miller, in Juarez, Mexico.      Wore glasses.      On Thursday, February 23rd, 1956, she obtained order from the City Court of the State of New York to legally change her name from Norma Jeane Mortenson to Marilyn Monroe.      Married Arthur Miller twice: the 1st time in a civil ceremony, then in a Jewish (to which she had converted) ceremony two days later.      Won an interlocutory decree from Joe DiMaggio on Wednesday, October 27th, 1954, but, under California law, the divorce was not finalized until exactly one year later.      Offered to convert to Catholism in order to marry Joe DiMaggio in a Church ceremony, but she was turned down because she was divorced. Subsequently, when the divorced DiMaggio married Marilyn in a civil ceremony at San Francisco City Hall, he was automatically excommunicated by the Church; this edict was struck down by Pope John XXIII\'s Ecumenical Council (Vatican II) in 1962.      Although it\'s believed that her mother, Gladys Baker, named her after Norma Talmadge, Gladys reportedly told her daughter, Bernice (Marilyn\'s half-sister), that she named Marilyn after Norma Jeane Cohen, a child she was Nanny to while living in Louisville, KY. while her son Robert Kermit Baker (Marilyn\'s half brother) was in Hospital, and estranged from the father Jasper Baker. The boy died, and Gladys returned to California.      The first stamp released in the USPS\'s Legends of Hollywood series, issued on Friday, June 1st, 1995.      Went to Van Nuys High School (Los Angeles) in the early 1940s but never graduated.      In 1973, Elton John released a single in tribute to her entitled ""Candle in the Wind"". In 1997, it was re-recorded with updated lyrics in memory of Princess Diana, becoming the UK\'s best-selling single of all time. Def Leppard\'s single ""Photograph"" from their ""Pyromania"" album was also written about Monroe. Glenn Danzig, lead singer of the punk band The Misfits, recorded a song called ""Who Killed Marilyn?"", inspired by his belief that she had been murdered. She is mentioned in the lyrics of several other songs, including ""Celluloid Heroes"" by The Kinks, ""We Didn\'t Start the Fire"" by Billy Joel, ""Vogue"" by Madonna, ""Lady Nina"" by rock band Marillion and ""Tell Me It\'s Not True"" from the musical ""Blood Brothers"".      Her behavior on the unfinished Something\'s Got to Give (1962) dimmed her reputation in the industry, but she was still big box office at the time of her death. What a Way to Go! (1964) and The Stripper (1963) were being developed for her.      When she was told that she was not the star in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) she verbally said ""Well whatever I am, I\'m still the blonde."".      The famous nude photo of her by Tom Kelley originally appeared as anonymous on a calendar entitled ""Miss Golden Dreams."" In 1952, a blackmailer threatened to identify the model as Marilyn, but she shrewdly thwarted the scheme by announcing the fact herself. Hugh M. Hefner then bought the rights to use the photo for $500. She became ""The Sweetheart of the Month"" in the first issue of Hefner\'s magazine, Playboy. Neither Kelley or Monroe ever saw a dime of the millions the calendar made for its publisher.      Formed her own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions, with Milton H. Greene, on December 31, 1955.      Appears on sleeve of The Beatles\' ""Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band"" album.      Batman writer/artist Bob Kane used Marilyn\'s likeness as a reference when he drew Vicki Vale.      Her USO Entertainer Identification Card (#129778) listed her name as ""Norma Jeane DiMaggio"".      She was ""discovered"" by press photographers during a World War II photo shoot at the Radioplane plant in California owned by actor Reginald Denny. She was one of the plant\'s employees. She left her job and signed with Emmeline Snively\'s modeling agency.      Was referenced in the dialogue of La dolce vita (1960), in the context of dieting.      The Emily Ann Faulkner/Rita Shawn character (played by Kim Stanley) in the John Cromwell film The Goddess (1958) was based on her.      The first Playboy magazine cover, featuring her, is pictured on one of six stamps issued in a souvenir sheet, issued by Grenada & the Grenadines on Saturday, December 1st, 2003 to celebrate Playboy\'s 50th and golden anniversary.      When she wasn\'t acting, she preferred to wear nothing but a bathrobe and occasionally a bikini.      Named 2nd Greatest Movie Star of all time by Premier Magazine, behind #1 Cary Grant and before #3 Tom Cruise.      The punk band The Misfits created or picked their name from the last movie title she acted in, The Misfits (1961).      Featured on a 1.11 euro postage stamp issued by French Post Office on Saturday, November 8th, 2003.      The very popular version of ""Santa Baby"" (also found in the film, Party Monster (2003)) thought to be sung by her was instead recorded by Cynthia Basinet for Jack Nicholson as a Christmas gift.      Ten days in advance, on Saturday, May 19th, 1962, she performed for U.S. President John F. Kennedy at his 45th birthday tribute in his honor at Madison Square Garden. She sang ""Happy Birthday"". (Kennedy\'s real birthday was May 29th).      After discovering her dress was torn, at the 1950 Academy Awards, she burst into tears.      Was named #6 Actress on The American Film Institute\'s 50 Greatest Screen Legends.      The dress Marilyn Monroe wore to serenade John F. Kennedy, on May 19, 1962 at his birthday celebration was so tight, that it had to be sewn onto her. She had to sit still for approximately an hour.      In 1999, a make-up kit that she personally owned, sold for $266,500.      One of the first Los Angeles natives to become a major movie star.      Aside from her birth name of Norma Jeane Mortenson, she was baptized and mainly known throughout her life as Norma Jeane Baker. During her modeling days she was also known as Norma Jeane Dougherty (her first marriage name), and also as Jean Norman. When she signed with 20th Century-Fox, studio casting executive Ben Lyon had first chosen the name Carol Lind as her stage name, although she disliked that. Eventually she chose her mother\'s maiden name of Monroe. Three names were drawn up as possible stage names. The first was Norma Jeane Monroe, although that sounded awkward; the second was Jean Monroe, and the third was Marilyn Monroe, the latter first name being chosen by Lyon who thought Norma Jeane resembled famed stage actress Marilyn Miller. Norma Jeane liked Jean Monroe, for it preserved some of her name, but Lyon convinced her that Marilyn Monroe sounded more alliterative and so it was chosen.      She took acting lessons from Michael Chekhov.Sergei Parajanov made collages of Monroe, Charles Chaplin, Mona Lisa, and other famous personages and many were featured in Mikhail Vartanov\'s Parajanov: The Last Spring (1992).      A 1982 review into the original inquest of Marilyn\'s death, conducted on its 20-year anniversary, concluded that the actress committed suicide or accidentally overdosed, and was not murdered--rumors that were fueled by the sloppy handling of evidence, the delay in securing the scene and the disappearance of tissue samples.      The ADR stage at Twentieth Century Fox is named after her.      In 1972, actress Veronica Hamel and her husband became the new owners of Marilyn\'s Brentwood home. They hired a contractor to replace the roof and remodel the house, and the contractor discovered a sophisticated eavesdropping and telephone tapping system that covered every room in the house. The components were not commercially available in 1962, but were in the words of a retired Justice Department official, ""standard FBI issue."" This discovery lent further support to claims of conspiracy theorists that Marilyn had been under surveillance by the Kennedys and the Mafia. The new owners spent $100,000 to remove the bugging devices from the house.      Was good friends with Dorothy Dandridge and Ava Gardner when they were all young, struggling actresses in Hollywood.      When budding actresses Shelley Winters and Marilyn were roommates in the late 1940s in Hollywood, Shelley said that one day she had to step out and asked Marilyn to ""wash the lettuce"" for a salad they were to share for dinner. When Shelley got back to the apartment, (Marilyn was apparently new to the art of cooking) had the leaves of lettuce in a small tub of soapy water and was scrubbing them clean. She had not heard of the phrase before either, or did not know it\'s true meaning.      Her real father was Charles Stanley Gifford. From his side, she was descended from the founder of Rhode Island, Roger Williams, and religious leader Anne Marbury-Hutchinson, from whom she is related to Lucretia Rudolph (wife of President James A. Garfield), Grover Cleveland, William Howard Taft, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, George Bush, and George W. Bush.      In How to Marry a Millionaire (1953), her character Pola is reading a book called ""Murder By Strangulation"" on the plane. Coincidentally, this is how her character was murdered in Niagara (1953).      Friend of James Haspiel.Don\'t Bother to Knock (1952) (her 18th film) was an attempt to prove to critics that she could act successfully. Because some earlier films took numerous takes and much longer time to complete. Especially, The Seven Year Itch (1955) which took numerous extra takes, for her character role, alone.      In Italy, her films were dubbed at the beginning of her career by Miranda Bonansea. As she matured she was dubbed by the marvellous and prolific Rosetta Calavetta with immense success, particularly in Some Like It Hot (1959). Zoe Incrocci lent her voice to Monroe once: in All About Eve (1950).      Her lifelong bouts with depression and self-destruction took their toll during filming The Seven Year Itch (1955). She frequently muffed scenes and forgot her lines, leading to sometimes as many as 40 takes of a scene before a satisfactory result was produced. Her constant tardiness and behavioral problems made the budget of the film swell to $1.8 million, a high price for the time. The film still managed to make a nice profit. The classic shot of her dress blowing up around her legs as she stands over a subway grating in this film was originally shot on Manhattan\'s Lexington Avenue at 52nd St., On Wednesday, September 15th, 1954, at 1:00 a.m. Five thousand onlookers whistled and cheered through take after take as Marilyn repeatedly missed her lines. This occurred in presence of an increasingly embarrassed and angry Joe DiMaggio (her husband at the time; the nine-month-old marriage officially ended during the shooting of this film). The original footage shot on that night in New York never made it to the screen; the noise of the crowd had made it unusable. Director Billy Wilder re-shot the scene on the 20th Century-Fox lot, on a set replicating Lexington Avenue, and got a more satisfactory result. However, it took another 40 takes for Marilyn to achieve the famous scene. Amazingly, her very narrow spike heels don\'t get stuck or break in the subway grating, although this was a universal problem at the time for the countless women wearing that very popular style heel in New York City in that era. An important promotional campaign was released for this mainstream motion picture, including a 52-foot-high cutout of Marilyn (from the blowing dress scene) erected in front of Loews State Theater, in New York City\'s Times Square. The movie premiere was on June 1, 1955, which was also her 29th birthday.      Was originally set to play Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany\'s (1961), but Audrey Hepburn played the role instead.What a Way to Go! (1964) initially intended as a vehicle for her, Shirley MacLaine played Louisa May Foster instead. Producer Arthur P. Jacobs was her publicist and J. Lee Thompson was on her list of approved directors.      She resided at the Hollywood Roosevelt while she was breaking into the acting business.      Her ""Happy Birthday Mr. President"" dress sold for $1,267,500.00, a world record for the most expensive piece of clothing ever sold, and is in the Guinness Book of World Records.      She left Hollywood to pursue serious acting by studying under Lee Strasberg at his Actors\' Studio in New York City.      Her classic shape, according to her dressmaker, is actually measured at 37-23-36.      In 1946, she signed her first studio contract with 20th Century Fox and dyed her hair.      Spent most of her early childhood in foster homes and orphanages because her mother was committed to a mental institution. Later, she lived with her mother\'s best friend, Grace McKee, and her family. McKee, a big fan of Jean Harlow, allowed her to wear make-up and curl her hair and, when she was 15, it was McKee who pierced her ears for her using a sewing needle. At 16, when McKee could no longer take care of her, she got married to avoid returning to the orphanage.      Producer Keya Morgan owns her Bible.      When she married Joe DiMaggio, the couple moved into a home at 508 N. Palm Drive in Beverly Hills, that was next door to Jean Harlow\'s last home.      She tried 9 different shades of blonde hair color before settling on platinum blonde.      Her personal library contained over 400 books on topics ranging from art to history, psychology, philosophy, literature, religion, poetry, and gardening. Many of the volumes, auctioned in 1999, bore her pencil notations in the margins.      There are over 600 books written about her.      Nearly 11 years after her death, she appeared on the cover of the Tuesday, July 17th, 1973 edition of ""Time Magazine"" in a full-color portrait taken by Bert Stern, from the last photographic sitting before her death. The cover-story heralds the publication of ""Marilyn,"" the biography of her by Norman Mailer. On the cover, her image dwarfs a black & white photo of Mailer. Mailer reportedly was displeased that ""Time"" chose to play up Monroe and diminish him, visually on the cover. The publication of the coffee table biography, which contained many photographs including several by Stern, was a major event of that publishing season. The book retailed for $19.95, which is approximately $100 in 2008 money, when factored for inflation.      ""Time Magazine"" reported in 1973 that Los Angeles County coroner Thomas Noguchi, the doctor who performed Monroe\'s autopsy, said that contrary to rumors, Monroe\'s stomach was never pumped after her death. The level of Nembutal in her bloodstream was 4.5 milligrams per 100, which is the equivalent of 40 or 50 capsules indicating suicide.      In 1961, after her divorce from Arthur Miller, she purchased a 2900 square foot hacienda style house in Brentwood, for $77,500.      Featured in ""Femme Noir: Bad Girls of Film"" by Karen Burroughs Hannsberry (McFarland, 1998).      Her last film Something\'s Got to Give (1962), was finally released in 2003. In the swimming pool scene, Marilyn reveals much more to the camera than she did in her then controversial calendar photo from the early 1950s.      Was in consideration for the part of Adelaide in Guys and Dolls (1955), but Vivian Blaine was cast instead.      Although she was perhaps the most famous actress of the 1950s decade, she never made more than $100,000 per picture upfront. Actresses such as Elizabeth Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck were earning significantly more.      Former stepmother of Robert A. Miller.      Half-sister of Berniece and Robert Kermitt Baker (but she never knew him, because he died at 14) by her mother\'s side. Sister-in-law of Paris Miracle, aunt of Mona Rae Miracle.      Became pregnant twice (in July 1957 and November 1958) during her marriage to Arthur Miller; on both occasions she suffered miscarriages.      Although she was an avid buyer of books and owned over 400 of them at her death, third husband Arthur Miller said, ""Aside from Colette\'s Cheri and a few short stories, I had never known her to read anything all the way through. She felt she could get the idea of a book, and often did, in just a few pages."".      Read and wrote poetry.      Ranked #3 in Men\'s Health 100 Hottest Women of all Time (2011).      Was a lifelong liberal Democrat.      Was close friends with singer Ella Fitzgerald and helped her rise in her musical career by arranging for her to sing in many upscale nightclubs some of which were segregated during the time of their friendship.      Monroe was a stutterer, a little known fact that was easily covered thanks to studio vocal coaches who provided her with diction lessons.      Learned to play the guitar for her role in River of No Return (1954) and the ukulele for her role in Some Like It Hot (1959).      Former sister-in-law of Joan Copeland, Vince DiMaggio, and Dominic DiMaggio. She and Joan shared the same birthday (June 1).      Film editor Dann Cahn recommended a young woman he was dating for the part of a beautiful young woman in Your Show Time (1949). Producer Stanley Rubin auditioned her and turned her down because she did not have enough experience. The young woman\'s name was Marilyn Monroe.      She was scheduled for The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955), but she was thought too old at 30 when the character was supposed to be 17 so she was replaced with Joan Collins.      According to Adam Curtis\' ""The Century of Self"", Monroe was in the later years subjected to an experimental kind of therapy where she was forced to attend the rituals of an average family and then expected to model her self upon the experience. Arthur Miller commented in the same documentary ""I don\'t think suffering is always a mistake"".Ayn Rand wrote a powerful tribute to her, compiled in ""The Voice of Reason"".      Although Monroe\'s famous nude calender grossed $750,000, the actress only got $50 and a bad cold out of it.      After working with Monroe in As Young as You Feel (1951) jealous co-star Constance Bennett wisecracked, ""Now there\'s a broad with a future behind her!"".      Among roles that Monroe turned down under her Fox contract: ""Pink Tights,"" ""How To Be Very, Very Popular,"" ""The Revolt of Mamie Stover,"" ""The Girl in the Red velvet Swing,\' ""The Jean Harlow Story,"" ""The Blue Angel,"" and ""Can-Can."".      She campaigned to play the Maria Schell role in ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" but she was never seriously considered.      According to the book ""Flesh and Fantasy"" Monroe perfected a Vaseline-based lip gloss.      ""Goodbye, Charlie"" with Debbie Reynolds, and ""The Stripper"" with Joanne Woodward were originally slated by Fox as Monroe projects.      Director Billy Wilder was quoted as saying, ""The great success of Monroe... was that she did not infuriate the female."".      Was good friends with Judy Garland.      Played by Mary Hanson in Hollywood Mouth 2 (2014). The director of that film, Jordan Mohr, had portrayed Marilyn\'s rival Simone Signoret in the stage play ""Two Simones: de Beauvoir and Signoret in Hollywood"".      Richard Widmark on co-starring with Monroe in ""Don\'t Bother to Knock"": ""She was a vulnerable kid. Murder to work with because she was scared to death of acting - even when she became a big movie actress. We had a hell of a time getting her out of the dressing room. When it was five o\'clock , it got irritating: \'C\'mon, Marilyn, we want to go home!\' She was a movie animal. Something happened between the lens and the film. Nobody knew what the hell it was. On the set, you\'d think: \'Oh, this is impossible; you can\'t print this.\' You\'d see it, and she\'s got everyone backed off the screen. Olivier said the same thing. She had that phenomenal something! Nobody knows what it is, but she had it. She certainly was never a professional actress. She always had a coach with her, lurking in the background, giving her signals. And she could never remember three words in a row - so it was all piece-work. Beyond all the technical deficiencies, she was a nice girl. We got along fine."".      Is one of 20 actresses who did not receive an Oscar nomination for their Best Actress in a Comedy/Musical Golden Globe-winning performance; hers being for Some Like It Hot (1959). The others, in chronological order, are: June Allyson for Too Young to Kiss (1951), Ethel Merman for Call Me Madam (1953), Jean Simmons for Guys and Dolls (1955), Taina Elg and Kay Kendall for Les Girls (1957), Rosalind Russell for A Majority of One (1961) and Gypsy (1962), Patty Duke for Me, Natalie (1969), Twiggy for The Boy Friend (1971), Raquel Welch for The Three Musketeers (1973), Barbra Streisand for A Star Is Born (1976), Bernadette Peters for Pennies from Heaven (1981), Kathleen Turner for Romancing the Stone (1984) and Prizzi\'s Honor (1985), Miranda Richardson for Enchanted April (1991), Jamie Lee Curtis for True Lies (1994), Nicole Kidman for To Die For (1995), Madonna for Evita (1996), Renée Zellweger for Nurse Betty (2000), Sally Hawkins for Happy-Go-Lucky (2008), and Amy Adams for Big Eyes (2014).      Egypt banned all her films after her conversion to Judaism in 1956.      One of Hajime Sorayama\'s ""Gynoids"" is based on her iconic pose from ""The Seven Year Itch"".      In order to fall asleep quicker and stay asleep longer she often mixed champagne with sleeping pills.      Became friends with Exotic Animal Trainer Ralph Helfer while working together in the movie River of No Return (1954) and got very attached to his Raccoon named Bandit.      In November 2016, the dress worn by Monroe while singing ""Happy Birthday"" to President John F. Kennedy at his 1962 birthday celebration was sold for $4.8 million, a record amount for a dress sold at auction. This surpassed the previous record for a dress sold at auction, which was also held by a dress worn by Monroe: the white dress she wore in The Seven Year Itch (1955) fetched $4.6 million in 2011.      Marilyn Monroe was 36 when she was found dead in her Beverly Hills-West Hollywood home on an early Sunday morning, August 5, 1962, just less than two and a half months after she appeared at New York City\'s Madison Square Garden, on a Saturday evening, May 19, 1962. The event was staged and produced by Broadway composer and lyricist Richard Adler. It was choreographed by Carol Haney of ""The Pajama Game"" fame. The Democratic event rally was a fund raising gala for the Democratic Party, the evening\'s program highlight, a celebration of John F. Kennedy\'s forty-fifth birthday, ten days before his actual birth-date on Tuesday, May 29, 1962, before 15,000 invited guests, Marilyn Monroe to sing ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President"" to President John F. Kennedy. Monroe sang the traditional ""Happy Birthday to You"" lyrics in a sultry, intimate voice, with ""Mr. President"" inserted as Kennedy\'s name. She continued the song with a snippet from the classic song, ""Thanks for the Memory"", for which she had written new lyrics specifically aimed at Kennedy. ""Thanks, Mr. President, For all the things you\'ve done, The battles that you\'ve won, The way you deal with U.S. Steel, And our problems by the ton, We thank you so much."" That moment in New York City, as we look back on it today in a grainy video, is frozen in time with all its possibilities still before it. We see celebration, joy, life. And we know too much about the future. Maybe that\'s why the gown Marilyn wore is worth $4.8 million. Because people will line up to see it, to stand next to something that once sparkled in the presence of greatness, of triumph, of happiness. The gown that broke the November 2016 auction record, was a creation of Hollywood film costume designer Jean Louis, with the original sketch executed by 19 year old costume illustrator Bob Mackie. Made of sheer silk marquisette-gauze fabric, the flesh-colored gown was hand-sewn with over 2,500 rhinestone-crystals, originally cost $1,440.33. It was tailored by an atelier so close to the body that Monroe was sewn into it before she walked onto the stage. The dress sold in 1999 at an auction in New York for over US $1.26 million. A new bidder subsequently purchased the dress in November 17, 2016. Peter Lawford was at the event that night to introduce Monroe. He made a play on the actress\'s reputation for tardiness by giving her a number of introductions throughout the night, building anticipation, after which she did not appear on stage. When Monroe finally appeared in a spotlight, Lawford introduced her as the ""late Marilyn Monroe"". Monroe peeled off her white ermine fur coat, revealing the dress, and the audience gasped. The film video of the event when actor Peter Lawford includes the downright eerie introduction of Monroe\'s missed cue for her entrance. ""Mr. President,"" Lawford says, leaning into the microphone, ""the LATE Marilyn Monroe."" As Lawford takes her white ermine coat, a thousand voices in the audience let out a gasp of ""Oh!"" at the sight of the gown, and the woman underneath it. According to Los Angeles\' Julien\'s Auctions, Marilyn was the only thing underneath the sheer gown, the dress was so tight that Monroe wore nothing else. Rumors of an affair between the president and the film star were sparked by the absence of Jacqueline Kennedy from the 45th birthday celebration, and by the sultry and suggestive performance. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who rarely attended Democratic Party events, spent the day at the Loudon Hunt Horse Show with her children John-John and Caroline. ""I can now retire from politics after having had \'Happy Birthday\' sung to me in such a sweet, wholesome manner,"" alluding to Marilyn\'s delivery, skintight dress, and image as a sex symbol, JFK said, when he stood alone at the lectern a few minutes later. Monroe had been spirited away from the microphone while the cameras were distracted by the entrance of an enormous birthday cake carried in on the shoulders of two men in chefs\' jackets. The November, 2016, buyer Ripley\'s Entertainment Inc., the company that operates ""Ripley\'s Believe It or Not! Museum"" in Hollywood, California, paid $4.8 million at auction. The company plans to display the dress there and also take it on tour. In 2017, Ripley\'s is celebrating its 100th year anniversary, and the ""Marilyn Monroe\'s \'Happy Birthday, Mr. President\' gown"" will be prominently featured, as it should be. Surviving to 100 and still overspending on dresses is something to celebrate. JFK was assassinated at age 46, eighteen months later after his Madison Square Garden 45th ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President"" birthday celebration, at 12:30pm Central Time, on a Friday noon motorcade parade, November 22, 1963, in Dealy Plaza in Dallas, Texas.      Subject of song ""Marilyn Monroe"" by Phoebe Legere.      Born on the same day as Andy Griffith.Personal Quotes (116)      I love a natural look in pictures. I like people with a feeling one way or another - it shows an inner life. I like to see that there\'s something going on inside them.      My problem is that I drive myself... I\'m trying to become an artist, and to be true, and sometimes I feel I\'m on the verge of craziness, I\'m just trying to get the truest part of myself out, and it\'s very hard. There are times when I think, \'All I have to be is true\'. But sometimes it doesn\'t come out so easily. I always have this secret feeling that I\'m really a fake or something, a phony.      [on living with the Bolenders when she was a little girl] They were terribly strict. They didn\'t mean any harm . . . it was their religion. They brought me up harshly.      [on meeting Joe DiMaggio for the first time] I was surprised to be so crazy about Joe. I expected a flashy New York sports type, and instead I met this reserved guy who didn\'t make a pass at me right away! He treated me like something special. Joe is a very decent man, and he makes other people feel decent, too.      [on why Joe DiMaggio didn\'t accompany her on one of her USO tours] Joe hates crowds and glamor.      [on why she divorced James Dougherty] My marriage didn\'t make me sad, but it didn\'t make me happy either. My husband and I hardly spoke to each other. This wasn\'t because we were angry. We had nothing to say. I was dying of boredom.      [on why her marriage to Joe DiMaggio didn\'t work] I didn\'t want to give up my career, and that\'s what Joe wanted me to do most of all.      I want to be a big star more than anything. It\'s something precious.      [on her favorite actress] Jean Harlow was my idol.      [on drifting in and out of orphanages when she was little] The world around me then was kind of grim. I had to learn to pretend in order to - I don\'t know - block the grimness. The whole world seemed sort of closed to me . . . [I felt] on the outside of everything, and all I could do was to dream up any kind of pretend game.      [on her early marriage to James Dougherty] Grace McKee arranged the marriage for me, I never had a choice. There\'s not much to say about it. They couldn\'t support me, and they had to work out something. And so I got married.      I\'m not interested in money, I just want to be wonderful.      A career is wonderful, but you can\'t curl up with it on a cold night.      Sometimes I think it would be easier to avoid old age, to die, young, but then you\'d never complete your life, would you? You\'d never wholly know yourself...      A dollar for your thoughts...      I\'ve been on a calendar, but never on time.      No one ever told me I was pretty when I was a little girl. All little girls should be told they\'re pretty, even if they aren\'t.      In Hollywood a girl\'s virtue is much less important than her hairdo. You\'re judged by how you look, not by what you are. Hollywood\'s a place where they\'ll pay you a thousand dollars for kiss, and fifty cents for your soul. I know, because I turned down the first offer often enough and held out for the fifty.      Dogs never bite me. Just humans.      Sex is a part of nature. I go along with nature.      Fame will go by and, so long, I\'ve had you, Fame. If it goes by, I\'ve always known it was fickle.      I knew I belonged to the public and to the world, not because I was talented or even beautiful, but because I never had belonged to anything or anyone else.      People had a habit of looking at me as if I were some kind of mirror instead of a person. They didn\'t see me, they saw their own lewd thoughts, then they white-masked themselves by calling me the lewd one.      A sex-symbol becomes a thing, I just hate being a thing. But if I\'m going to be a symbol of something I\'d rather have it sex than some other things we\'ve got symbols of.      The truth is I\'ve never fooled anyone. I\'ve let people fool themselves. They didn\'t bother to find out who and what I was. Instead they would invent a character for me. I wouldn\'t argue with them. They were obviously loving somebody I wasn\'t. When they found this out, they would blame me for disillusioning them---and fooling them.      To put it bluntly, I seem to have a whole superstructure with no foundation. But I\'m working on the foundation.      If I had observed all the rules, I\'d never have gotten anywhere.      I want to grow old without face-lifts... I want to have the courage to be loyal to the face that I have made.      It\'s often just enough to be with someone. I don\'t need to touch them. Not even talk. A feeling passes between you both. You\'re not alone.      I\'m a failure as a woman. My men expect so much of me, because of the image they\'ve made of me and that I\'ve made of myself, as a sex symbol. Men expect so much, and I can\'t live up to it.      It stirs up envy, fame does. People you run into feel that, well, who does she think she is, Marilyn Monroe? They feel fame gives them some kind of privilege to walk up to you and say anything to you, you know, of any kind of nature - and it won\'t hurt your feelings.      Fame is fickle, and I know it. It has it\'s compensations but it also has it\'s drawbacks, and I\'ve experienced them both.      My illusions didn\'t have anything to do with being a fine actress. I knew how third rate I was. I could actually feel my lack of talent, as if it were cheap clothes I was wearing inside. But my God, how I wanted to learn, to change, to improve!      If I play a stupid girl, and ask a stupid question, I\'ve got to follow it through. What am I supposed to do, look intelligent?      [on her famous nude calendar pose in 1949] My sin has been no more than I have written, posing for the nude because I desperately needed 50 dollars to get my car out of hock.      An actor is supposed to be a sensitive instrument. Isaac Stern takes good care of his violin. What if everyone jumped on his violin?      There was my name up in lights. I said, ""God, somebody\'s made a mistake!"" But there it was in lights. And I sat there and said, ""Remember, you\'re not a star"". Yet there it was up in lights.      Some people have been unkind. If I say I want to grow as an actress, they look at my figure. If I say I want to develop, to learn my craft, they laugh. Somehow they don\'t expect me to be serious about my work.      I was never used to being happy, so that wasn\'t something I ever took for granted. I did sort of think, you know, marriage did that. You see, I was brought up differently from the average American child because the average child is brought up expecting to be happy - that\'s it, successful, happy, and on time.      You know, when you grow up you can get kind of sour, I mean, that\'s the way it can go.      Wouldn\'t it be nice to be like men and get notches in your belt and sleep with most attractive men and not get emotionally involved?      I used to think as I looked at the Hollywood night, ""There must be thousands of girls sitting alone like me, dreaming of becoming a movie star. But I\'m not going to worry about them. I\'m dreaming the hardest.""      The trouble with censors is they worry if a girl has cleavage. They ought to worry if she hasn\'t any.      I used to say to myself, ""What the devil have you got to be proud about, Marilyn Monroe?"" And I\'d answer, ""Everything, everything"".      [on stardom] It scares me. All those people I don\'t know, sometimes they\'re so emotional. I mean, if they love you that much without knowing you, they can also hate you the same way.      [Johann Wolfgang von Goethe] said, ""Talent is developed in privacy"", you know? And it\'s really true. There is a need for aloneness which I don\'t think most people realize for an actor. It\'s almost having certain kinds of secrets for yourself that you\'ll let the whole world in on only for a moment, when you\'re acting.      I want to be an artist, an actress with integrity.      I\'ve never dropped anyone I believed in.      [on John F. Kennedy] It would be so nice to have a president who looks so young and good-looking.      I restore myself when I\'m alone. A career is born in public -- talent in private.      Talent is developed in privacy... but everybody is always tugging at you. They\'d all like sort of a chunk at you. They\'d kind of like to take pieces out of you.      I want to be an artist... not an erotic freak. I don\'t want to be sold to the public as a celluloid aphrodisiacal.      [about Montgomery Clift] He\'s the only person I know that is in worse shape than I am.      I\'ve never liked the name Marilyn. I\'ve often wished that I had held out that day for Jean Monroe. But I guess it\'s too late to do anything about it now.      [on Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift] Marlon\'s kinda hard to tie down, they say. He\'s never sure what he wants to do. He and Monty Clift have a lot in common, though they\'re totally different people, but they don\'t plan their careers too well and they\'re not ambitious enough for their talents.      Personally, I react to Marlon Brando. He\'s a favorite of mine.      [on Frank Sinatra] He is a man at the top of his profession and is a fine actor as well. You know, he got an Oscar for From Here to Eternity (1953). He has helped more people anonymously than anybody else. And the miserable press smears him with lies about his being involved with the Mafia and gangsters. And Frank just takes it.      [on Mae West] A nice lady even though she turned down making a picture with me. That just shows how smart she is.      Speaking of Oscars, I would win overwhelmingly if the Academy gave an Oscar for faking orgasms. I have done some of my best acting convincing my partners I was in the throes of ecstasy.      [on Laurence Olivier on the set of The Prince and the Showgirl (1957)] Olivier came into my dressing room to give me hell for screwing up. I soothed him by telling him I thought his Hamlet (1948) was one of the greatest films ever made. You know he won an Oscar for it.      When Clark Gable died, I cried for 2 days straight. I couldn\'t eat or sleep.      [on Sigmund Freud] I read his ""Introductory Lectures,"" God, what a genius. He makes it so understandable. And he is so right. Didn\'t he say himself that [William Shakespeare] and [Fyodor Dostoevsky] had a better understanding of psychology than all the scientists put together? Damn it, they do.      [on James Joyce and the character of Molly Bloom in Ulysses] Here is Joyce writing what a woman thinks to herself. Can he, does he really know her innermost thoughts? But after I read the whole book, I could better understand that Joyce is an artist who could penetrate the souls of people, male or female. It really doesn\'t matter that Joyce doesn\'t have...or never felt a menstrual cramp. To me Leopold Bloom is a central character. He is the despised Irish Jew, married to an Irish Catholic woman. It is through them Joyce develops much of what he wants to say. Do you agree that the scene where Bloom is looking at the little girl on the swing is the most erotic in the book?      [on John F. Kennedy] When he has finished his achievements, he will take his place with Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and [Franklin D. Roosevelt] as one of our greatest Presidents. I\'m glad he has [Robert F. Kennedy]. It\'s like the Navy. The President is the Captain and Bobby is his Executive Officer. Bobby would do absolutely anything for his brother. And so would I. I\'ll never embarrass him. As long as I have memory, I have John Fitzgerald Kennedy.      [on Sunday being the loneliest day of the week for her] All the men I know are spending the day with their wives and families, and all the stores in Los Angeles are closed. You can\'t wander through looking at all the pretty clothes and pretending to buy something.      [on Marlon Brando] He\'s very sweet and tender, not at all the Stanley Kowalski rapist people think he is.Arthur Miller wouldn\'t have married me if I had been nothing but a dumb blonde.      I have always been deeply terrified to really be someone\'s wife since I know from life one cannot love another, ever, really.      [on Peter Lawford] I have a need to be frightened and nothing really in my personal relationships and dealings lately have been frightening me, except for him. I felt very uneasy at different times with him, the real reason I was afraid of him is because I believe him to be homosexual...Peter wants to be a woman and would like to be me, I think.      Hollywood is a place where they\'ll pay you $50,000 for a kiss and 50c for your soul.      It\'s better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone.      It was the creative part that kept me going, trying to be an actress. I enjoy acting when you really hit it right.      I did what they said and all it got me was a lot of abuse. Everyone\'s just laughing at me. I hate it. Big breasts, big ass, big deal.      [on Arthur Miller\'s script for \'The Misfits\'] Arthur did this to me. He could have written anything and he comes up with this. If that\'s what he thinks of me, well, then I\'m not for him and he\'s not for me. Arthur says it\'s his movie. I don\'t think he even wants me in it.      I won\'t be satisfied until people want to hear me sing without looking at me.      The body is meant to be seen, not all covered up.      I love to do things that censors won\'t pass.      I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they\'re right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.      I have feelings too. I am still human. All I want is to be loved, for myself and for my talent.      I knew I belonged to the public and to the world, not because I was talented or even beautiful, but because I had never belonged to anything or anyone else.      Boys think girls are like books, If the cover doesn\'t catch their eye they won\'t bother to read what\'s inside.      [on shooting the famous scene in The Seven Year Itch (1955) where wind from the subway beneath blows her skirt up] At first it was all innocent and fun, but when Billy Wilder kept shooting the scene over and over the crowd of men kept on applauding and shouting, \'More, more Marilyn - let\'s see more.\' What was supposed to be a fun scene turned into a sex scene.      I\'ve often stood silent at a party for hours listening to my movie idols turn into dull and little people.      When you\'re young and healthy you can plan on Monday to commit suicide, and by Wednesday you\'re laughing again.      Suicide is a person\'s privilege. I don\'t believe it\'s a sin or a crime, it\'s your right if you do. Though it doesn\'t get you anywhere.      The other girls rode to school in a bus. I had no nickel to pay for the ride. Rain or shine, I walked the two miles from my ""aunt\'s"" home to the school. I hated the walk, I hated the school. I had no friends. The pupils seldom talked to me and never wanted me in their games. Nobody ever walked home with me or invited me to visit their homes. This was partly because I came from the poor part of the district where all the Mexicans and Japanese lived. It was also because I couldn\'t smile at anyone.      How or why I can act - and I\'m not sure I can - is the thing for me to understand. The torture, let alone the day to day happenings - the pain one cannot explain to another.      Executives can get colds and stay home and phone in - but the actor? How dare you get a cold or a virus! I wish they had to act a comedy with a temperature and a virus infection! I\'m there to give a performance, not to be disciplined by a studio. This isn\'t supposed to be a military school, after all.      [on homosexuality] No sex is wrong if there\'s love involved.      As long as I can remember, I\'ve always loved people.      What the world really needs is a real feeling of kinship. Everybody: stars, laborers, Negroes, Jews, Arabs. We are all brothers. Please don\'t make me a joke. End the interview with what I believe.      People always ask me if I believe diamonds are a girl\'s best friend. Frankly, I don\'t.      I have favorite motion-picture stars, like everyone else. You know who mine are? My favorite is Marlon Brando. I mean, really, I believe we\'d be an interesting combination. I\'ve said that about Marlon for a long time, but we haven\'t found the right story. Can you imagine us on the big screen? I hope something happens soon. Greta Garbo, I\'ve never met her. It really bugs me when I miss one of her films on TV. Oh, if you could only get me to meet her! I\'ve also heard wonderful things about Jeanne Eagels and Laurette Taylor. And the one they called the Blond Bombshell: Jean Harlow. Kay Kendall was a great comedian. She was really talented. I would have loved working with Gerard Philipe, the handsome French star- his films I\'ve been told were a huge success in France, as were his stage plays. I was told he wanted to make films with me. Oh, what a shame we never got the opportunity. We would have made an interesting team. What a shame. He was so young to die; he was thirty-six. He had been ill and apparently died of a heart attack.      Nearly everyone I knew talked to me about God. They always warned me not to offend Him.      Drugs pull you down and shut the lid on life. Pot opens everything up. All the anxieties, the creepy crawly blues, it all just drifts away and you can slowly remember what it feels like to be alive. Even more importantly, you can take a step back from the crap that\'s flying and see what really is important, which of the many things in your life really deserves worrying about. Not much!

Everybody\'s out to get them no matter what they do.      It might be kind of a relief to be finished. It\'s sort of like you don\'t know what kind of a yard dash you\'re running, but then you\'re at the finish line and you sort of sigh - you\'ve made it! But you never have. You have to start all over again.      I think that sexuality is only attractive when it\'s natural and spontaneous.      I sleep in the nude but I pull the sheets up.      When it comes down to it, I let them think what they want. If they care enough to bother with what I do, then I\'m already better than them.      I remember when I got the part in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Jane Russell, she was the brunette in it and I was the blonde. She got $200,000 for it, and I got my $500 a week, but that to me was, you know, considerable. She, by the way, was quite wonderful to me. The only thing was I couldn\'t get a dressing room. I said, finally, I really got to this kind of level, I said, ""Look, after all, I am the blonde, and it is Gentlemen Prefer Blondes!"" Because still they always kept saying, ""Remember, you\'re not a star."" I said, ""Well, whatever I am, I am the blonde!""      Who said nights were for sleep?      We are all born sexual creatures, thank God, but it\'s a pity so many people despise and crush this natural gift.      I\'m for the individual as opposed to the corporation. The way it is the individual is the underdog, and with all the things a corporation has going for them the individual comes out banged on her head. The artist is nothing. It\'s really tragic.      People had a habit of looking at me like I was some kind of mirror instead of a person. They didn\'t see me, they saw their own lewd thoughts, then they white-masked themselves by calling me the lewd one.      For the first family I lived with, to go to a movie was a sin. Every night I was told to pray that I would not wake up in hell.      There is nothing positive about being fat. And there is nothing positive about loving yourself. We all need to conform to society\'s expectations of who we are and if we don\'t, who will? Life is more enjoyable when you are thin and pretty. I was never fat a day in my life and I never will.      Creativity has got to start with humanity and when you\'re a human being, you feel, you suffer.      Fame is like caviar. It\'s good to have caviar, but not every damned day!      Let yourself go, the pleasure of physical movement is so important. If that\'s a problem, you say to yourself, what is there that I am afraid of, or hiding? Maybe your libido!      I have always felt comfortable in blue jeans. I have found it interesting, however, that people also whistle at blue jeans. I have to admit that I like mine to fit. There\'s nothing I hate worse than baggy blue jeans.      I want the world to see my body.      Men who think that a woman\'s past love affairs lessen her love for them are stupid. A woman can bring a new love to each man that she loves, providing that there are not too many.      The public doesn\'t mind people living together without being married, providing they don\'t overdo it.

Rory starred in over 80 films and 1,000 television episodes. Before becoming an actor he worked as a boxer, a lumberjack, a truck driver and a cowpuncher. Tall and handsome, he benefited from a screen test at 20th Century-Fox, arranged for him by Sue Carol, a Hollywood agent and the wife of actor Alan Ladd, who is said to have spotted Calhoun while he was riding a horse in a Los Angeles park. He debuted on screen in Something for the Boys (1944), with Carmen Miranda, billed as ""Frank McCown"". David O. Selznick changed his name to Rory Calhoun, and after playing small parts for a while, he graduated to starring in western films, including River of No Return (1954) with Marilyn Monroe and Robert Mitchum. Calhoun\'s better-known pictures include How to Marry a Millionaire (1953) with Lauren Bacall, Monroe and Betty Grable, and With a Song in My Heart (1952) with Susan Hayward.From 1959 to 1960 he starred in the CBS television series The Texan (1958). More than two decades later he returned to CBS for five years as Judge Judson Tyler on the daytime serial Capitol (1982). His final appearance, 70 years old but handsome as ever, was as Ernest Tucker in Pure Country (1992). Calhoun has two stars on Hollywood\'s Walk of Fame: one for motion pictures, and one for television.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Bill Takacs <kinephile@aol.com>          Spouse (2)               Susan Kathleen Langely          (19 April\xa01971            - 28 April\xa01999)\xa0(his death)\xa0(1 child)           Lita Baron (29 August\xa01948            - 17 July\xa01970)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(3 children)          Trade Mark (1)        Black cowboy hatTrivia (18)      Mentioned numerous times in the episode of The Simpsons (1989) where Mr. Burns steals the puppies from the Simpsons.      As a teenager Calhoun dropped out of high school and drifted into petty crime, becoming a car thief. He was caught and spent three years in a federal reformatory. In the mid-\'50s blackmailers threatened to make his prison record public; instead, Calhoun himself revealed it. He died after a ten-day hospitalization for advanced stages of emphysema and diabetes.      When Lita Baron sued for divorce, she named 79 women with whom he had allegedly committed adultery. Calhoun responded, ""Heck, she didn\'t even include half of them"".      His daughters with Lita Baron are Cindy (b. 1957), Tami (b. 1958) and Lorri (b. 1961). His daughter with Sue Rhodes is Rory Patricia (b. 1971).      Calhoun\'s second cousin is popular Canadian sportscaster and talk show host Bob McCown (host of ""Prime Time Sports"" on the Fan 590 Radio and nationwide on Rogers Sportsnet).      Second wife Sue Rhodes was a journalist.      In 1955 his agent, Henry Willson, disclosed information about Calhoun\'s years in prison to ""Confidential"" magazine in exchange for the tabloid not printing an exposé about the secret homosexual life of Rock Hudson, another Willson client. The disclosure had no negative effect on Calhoun\'s career and only served to solidify his ""bad boy"" image.Henry Willson, an agent known for a stable of young, attractive, marginally talented actors with unusual names (Rock Hudson, Tab Hunter) signed Rory to a contract and initially christened him ""Troy Donahue"", then changed it to ""Rory Calhoun"". He used the Troy Donahue name later on another up-and-coming actor, with excellent results.      In 1943, while horseback riding in the Hollywood Hills, he accidentally met actor Alan Ladd, whose wife Sue Carol was an agent. She landed him a one-line role in the Laurel and Hardy comedy short The Bullfighters (1945) under his name of ""Frank McCown"".      After his release from San Quentin, Calhoun worked several odd jobs, including cowpuncher and lumberjack.      His young criminal career was rather extensive. A high school dropout, he stole a revolver at age 13, which landed him in the California Youth Authority\'s Preston School of Industry reformatory at Ione, CA. He escaped while in the adjustment center (jail within the jail). After robbing several jewelry stores, he stole a car and drove it across state lines. This offense sent him to the federal penitentiary in Springfield, MO, for three years. When he finished his sentence he was incarcerated in San Quentin State Penitentiary in California on other charges and remained there until he was paroled just before his 21st birthday.      When he was nine months old his father died. After his mother remarried he occasionally used the last name of his stepfather, Durgin.Guy Madison was one of his closest friends. The two men often went on fishing and hunting trips. Guy and his (second) wife Sheila Connolly named him godfather to their first born Bridget.      He and Vitina Marcus had a daughter, Athena Marcus Calhoun, who became ""The World\'s Most Beautiful Showgirl"" and was awarded ""The Key to the City of Las Vegas"" in 1987.      Was a registered Republican who campaigned for Richard Nixon in 1968 and 1972.      The July 22, 1970, issue of ""Variety"", in the Hollywood Production Pulse column, states that the movie ""The Low Price of Fame"" had started filming May 18 in Iowa, starring Calhoun, Gardner McKay and Yvonne De Carlo. Jerry Schafer was producer / director and executive producer was Donald B. Running, for Carvel Productions. There is no evidence the film was completed or released.      Partners, with Victor M. Orsatti, in Rorvic Productions, a film production company.      The June 30, 1971, issue of Variety, in the Hollywood Production Pulse section, lists a movie ""Everyman"" directed by Jerry Schafer for Hollywood International Pictures with actors Rory Calhoun, Ruth Roman, Rosie Grier, Jim Mitchum, Tom Bosley, Jesse White, John Fiedler, and Percy Helton which started filming Jun 14, 1971, in Dallas.

He was with the show for four years, after which Lassie acquired a whole new family.Rettig, the only child of Elias Rettig, a Lockheed aircraft-parts inspector, and his wife, Rosemary, began his career at age 5, after he was spotted by an acting coach who lived in the family\'s apartment building in Queens, N.Y. After touring with Mary Martin in Annie Get Your Gun, he landed roles in movies, among them 1954\'s _River of No Return (1954)_, starring Marilyn Monroe. Then, at 12, he was cast as Jeff Miller. He bonded strongly with his canine costar--who, like the whole line of Lassies, was male--and even took him home on weekends (the family had moved West in 1949). That stopped when Lassie became confused about whether to obey his trainer or Rettig. In a string of jobs he had little luck, and he was busted in the \'70s for marijuana possession and cocaine smuggling. (The latter charge was overturned).After graduating from L.A.\'s University High in 1958 and marrying 15-year-old Darlene Portwood, he tried to get back into acting, without much success. In the early \'80s, having tried selling tools and managing a health club, he founded an est-like motivation program.

He built the first add-on library for Clipper, pioneering the public domain tools that make all our jobs easier. Tom wrote articles for Data Based Advisor, appeared on FoxPro Advisor satellite TV conferences, and spoke at many developer events including the FoxPro DevCons. Tom Rettig\'s Help and Tom Rettig\'s FoxPro Handbook taught the intricacies of FoxPro. Tom\'s ability as a programmer was legendary - he was a guru with a Hollywood-famous name.

An already established child star, he was chosen from over 500 other boys to play the 11 year old midwestern farm boy, Jeff Miller, when Lassie (1954) premiered on September 12, 1954. He stayed with the series until 1958. He made his stage debut at age 6 in the touring company of ""Annie Get Your Gun"", with Mary Martin. His screen debut was at age 9 and he made 17 films. His most memorable screen performance was as the boy with the vivid imagination in The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T. (1953). Following Lassie (1954) came a troubled life filled with failure to land adult roles, arrests and convictions for growing marijuana and importing cocaine, bankruptcy, divorce, and a string of jobs including photographer, tool salesman, computer programmer, and health club manager. Mr. Rettig was also a long time advocate for the legalization of marijuana.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Anonymous                    For the last several years of his life Tom was a successful software developer.

He was regarded as one of the experts; a software guru in the area of desktop PC database applications such as dBase. At the time of his untimely death, he was a central figure in the community of FoxPro database developers and his passing was felt professionally and personally by many who had come to know Tom as a visionary and as generous mentor.      Father to actor Mason Storm.      After appearing with Mary Martin in ""Annie Get Your Gun"" for 22 months, Tommy was offered more stage roles, including ""Peter Pan"" and ""The Member of the Wedding,"" the latter play made famous by Brandon De Wilde. His strong-willed mother, however, decided Tommy should go for the movies. Ironically, Tommy won the boy role on Lassie (1954) after de Wilde turned it down.      Was Marilyn Monroe\'s youngest date ever when he escorted her to the premiere of River of No Return (1954) in 1954.      TV folklore has it that when the producers had narrowed the casting down to three boy juveniles for the part of Lassie\'s young master, they allowed Lassie herself to make the final decision. Supposely the dog walked straight over to Tommy and affectionately nuzzled the boy, thus winning him the role.      More than anything else, due to his shortness in height (5\' 4""), his adult career never panned out.      Two sons: Tom and Deane.      Graduated from Los Angeles\' University High School.      In the 1970s, he and his family lived on a farm near Arroyo Grande, CA, where he secretly grew marijuana between rows of corn. His multiple drug busts eventually destroyed his marriage.      While making the movie The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T. (1953), he became acquainted with dog trainer Frank Weatherwax, whose brother, Rudd, bought the ""Lassie"" rights from MGM for an upcoming TV series. Jeff auditioned and, to determine who would make the best Jeff, the brothers invited Tommy and two other child actors up for the part to spend a week at their North Hollywood ranch with the three collies who would play the lead. Tommy won the contract at $2,500 a week.      His father was Jewish and his mother was of Italian descent.Personal Quotes (3)      With Lassie, I\'d gladly work for free!

Of all of Marilyn Monroe's leading men, Robert Mitchum was the only one
who knew her back when. In 1941 before he made his screen debut in a

course Jim had a wife Norma Jean at the time and Bob and Dorothy
occasionally socialized.<br><br>He knew all about her psychological problems and when it came time to
do a film with her when both became screen legends, Mitchum was not
about to get himself involved. That probably helped because during the
shooting Marilyn and director Otto Preminger stopped speaking and would

Calhoun. Calhoun and Monroe nearly drown on a river when Mitchum
rescues them and their raft. No good deed goes unpunished so Calhoun
takes Mitchum's horse and Mitchum, Monroe, and Mitchum's son Tommy
Rettig use the raft to go after him. They're kind of forced to because
the Indians are on the warpath.<br><br>She's certainly quite a distraction for a man on a mission and at one
point Mitchum does give into lust ever so briefly. Which does make
River of No Return one of the more realistic westerns ever done.<br><br>Twentieth Century Fox decided to go whole hog on this one, shooting the
film up in Banff. But with Marilyn and Otto feuding it was not a happy
set. Otto walked off the picture and Jean Negulesco finished it out.
Joe DiMaggio flew up to the set because of rumors of Mitchum and
Marilyn, that were completely unfounded, but Joe was the jealous type.

Cinemascope was at the height of popularity when Fox decided to cast Marilyn
Monroe and Robert Mitchum in a story set against the scenic splendor of the
Rockies. Marilyn even gets to sing a few fetching song numbers (her saloon
song atop a bar is a standout and she delivers a totally professional job).
Sleepy-eyed Mitchum makes a good partner for Monroe and little Tommy Rettig
scores as the adoring little boy who watches wistfully as Monroe strums a
song on her guitar.<br><br>Into the story, slight as it is, is an Indian attack while Mitchum and
Monroe battle the rapids. It's all very routine going, for the most part,
but the chance to see Monroe strut her stuff in a tight pair of jeans and
Mitchum give a sturdy, likeable performance is enough to make the movie a
pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. <br><br>Nothing great here, but a very satisfying performance by Marilyn who does a
more than competent job on her less than inspired songs. And the scenery
helps. <br><br>Otto Preminger's direction is not as taut as it should have been for a tale
of this sort--in fact, the whole film has a lumbering pace that seems to
make some parts of the story seem more like filler material than anything
else. And poor Rory Calhoun has little to do.

Otto Preminger's ""River of No Return"" is set in Northwest Canada, in
savage Indian territory, in the gold rush days... The plot is weak but
the scenery is spectacular and the action of the river dramatically
powerful... Otto Preminger knew how to create tension and threat in the
grandeur and menace of the Canadian Rockies <br><br>The film opens in the 1875 with widower Matt Calder (Mitchum), coming
to town, where his ten-year-old son Mark (Tommy Rettig) is waiting for
him... He has served a term in prison for shooting a man in the back,
even though he shot the man only to keep him from murdering a friend...
Mark has now been sent to join his father, who has bought a farm for
them...<br><br>Mark has made the acquaintance of Kay (Marilyn Monroe), a saloon
singer, while waiting for his father.... Calder thanks Kay for her
kindness to his boy, and father and son depart for their farm...<br><br>One day, Calder sees Kay and gambler Harry Weston (Rory Calhoun) in
trouble on a raft in the river near his home... He helps them ashore
and learns that Watson is in a hurry to get to town to register a gold
claim... So eager is he that he steals his rescuer's only horse, and
leaving his girl behind as well, rides away...<br><br>The predicament of those left is deepened by the fact that Indians are
on a rampage and are due to attack the farm at any moment... The only
way left to get to town is by a wild river...<br><br>Photographed in Technicolor and CinemaScope, the film is designed to
exploit the splendors of the mountains, trees and rapid rivers plus the
magnetic pleasant figure of Marilyn who is the only charming woman
surrounded by two handsome men and a charming kid...<br><br>Marilyn sings 4 numbers in the film: ""One Silver Dollar,"" ""I'm Gonna
File My Claim,"" ""Down in the Meadow,"" and ""The River of No Return."" The
little boy, Tommy Rettig, played another big-scale Western, Delmer
Daves' ""The Last Wagon,"" with Richard Widmark, Felicia Farr, and Susan
Kohner...

I just love this movie, except for that one scene (everybody knows
which one). It's a very good venue for Mitchum and perhaps the best
Monroe ever had. Really great actors make you forget that they are
either actors or stars. These two do that quite well in spite of a
loosely written script and a bit too much sweetness in the person of
the boy. I think I love this movie as much for the fact that someone
finally let Monroe act as I do for the fun of watching it. She did a
good job of bringing her character, rather than Marilyn, to the screen.
I enjoyed the scenes between her and the boy. She was very believable
as a nurturing, protective figure. She would have done well as an
actress. This movie is just a small sample.. Lonestar

An unexceptional story beautifully directed by Otto Premiger, whose handling
of this routine material makes it work as well in its way as the best of
Anthony Mann. A stolen rifle figures prominently in this western, as does an
Indian attack, the budding romance between a puritanical homesteader with a
past and a saloon singer in trouble, and of course the eponymous and
oftentimes violent river they raft down. The northwest scenery is
breathtaking. Preminger gives a nice drive to his narrative without
stressing any one element for too long. For a while it's a farmer-son story,
then a badman story, then there's a journey down the river, then a romance,
then an Indian attack. Scenes play out dramatically rather than
melodramatically despite the genre limitations of the script, and this shows
Preminger's steady hand. He doesn't mind making his movie a bit of a
travelogue or nature film if the mood strikes him, and therefore the picture
has a nice diversity, and many lovely things to look at. Chief among its
many scenic attractions is Marilyn Monroe in the female lead. I can't say
that this is her best performance but it's one of her best non-musical or
comedy roles that isn't too serious, which is to say it's not at all like
How To Marry a Millionaire, Bus Stop, The Prince and the Showgirl or The
Seven Year Itch in that there's no air of a heavyweight property with lots
of money and talent behind it, which works in the movie's favor, as it is a
pleasant surprise. This is perhaps Miss Monroe's only 'throwaway' role of
her starring career, and she makes the best of it by playing her part
naturally and with none of the ironic, self-referential self-deprecation one
often finds in her major starring vehicles. Robert Mitchum is excellent in
the male lead, as is Tommy Rettig as his son, who more than holds his own
with these two adult heavyweights. The songs Monroe sings are all pretty
good and well-delivered and add to the story in each case, which is unusual.
One cares for these people, who behave credibly despite the mechanical plot
devices, and the movie ends on a touching visually and musically
orchestrated grace note, as if something of profound importance had just
transpired.

you don't like Westerns. Basically I don't know if they are now popular
again, but this film is well worth it due to Monroe, Mitchum and the
story.<br><br>Normally, I do not like John Wayne and cowboy/Indian type films,they
seem too dated for today's audience, but started watching this for
Monroe. She is very good, a saloon singer who hooks up with Rory
Calhoun, a gambler, who wants to stakes his claim on some land reputed
to have gold; There are a few skirmishes, Monroe actually sings quite
well, and the interaction between her and Mitchum is believable.<br><br>All in all a nice film with some good whitewater scenes, good acting
and you may even forget you are watching a western!. 9/10.

Life is like this river,sometimes peaceful,sometimes wild.A ""river""
movie,before the ""road movie"" genre was invented,Otto Preminger's work
remains extremely beautiful:an unusually inventive cinemascope which
enhances the scenery :the raft tossed by the tides of misfortune,seems
like a grain of sand in these deep valleys,these ancestral forests.<br><br>A story as linear as the river,which focuses on one of Preminger's
favorite subjects:redemption (see ""where the sidewalk ends"",""forever
Amber"").If someone does something wrong,Kay says ,it's because he's
often compelled to do so.Mark,the young boy ,will understand ,and
little did he know it would not be long !<br><br>The songs (the title track and ""one silver dollar"" ) are sumptuous,and
add magic to this odyssey of redemption.And when Kay throws her
high-heeled shoes in the dust,what a nice way to pick up the pieces!

Beautiful scenery. Oh, and the mountains looked good, too. A really good
part for Marilyn Monroe. It gave her a chance to be more than just a
sexpot,
and she pulled it off. A young Robert Mitchum was very good, with his usual
quiet masculinity. He seemed a little unused to the horse, however, in an
early scene. I thought the film would have been better if it had ended
about
30 seconds earlier than it did. Another note: back in those days Hollywood
could portray Indians as implacably hostile, without the political
correctness required now. Refreshing. Overall a pretty decent flick.

Nine-year old boy is reunited with his estranged father in a northwest
boom town in the midst of Gold Fever; they take off for a life of
fishing and hunting but are soon railroaded by a crooked gambler and
his gal, a saloon singer who gets a pang of conscience and stays with
dad and the kid. Soon, all three are on the run from Injuns, on a raft
down a treacherous river. Lackadaisical western puts action on the
back-burner to focus on character interaction, which in this case isn't
such a bad thing. Robert Mitchum never puts on a big show: tough and
steely, but paternal towards the kid and easy with the lady, he's
gruffly polite--and unapologetic about his behavior. Marilyn Monroe is
such a drama queen, she can't deliver a simple monologue without
twitching something (her eyes, her lips, her nostrils); she is lovely
(and, in a singing scene outdoors with the boy, very natural), but one
warms to her because she's Marilyn (her legend exceeds the worn
material and her over-emphatic delivery). Otto Preminger directed, but
this doesn't feel like a Preminger movie. There are no tart or prodding
scenes, and the dangerous rapids excursions--and Indian rampages--are
not staged for maximum impact. The Indians, armed with arrows, simply
seem like bad shots, and the close-up sequences on the raft were
obviously achieved in the studio. Still, the occasional on-location
photography is breath-taking, and the three principles grow steadily on
the audience as well as towards each other. Beautiful theme song is
sung in versions by both Mitchum and Monroe. **1/2 from ****

bankable and hottest stars of the 1950s together in the same picture
would totally ignite sparks of pure ecstasy flying this way, and that,

nothing more than a complete fizzle, and that was about all.<br><br>I'd say that a lot of this picture's glaring faults rested squarely on
the shoulders of its demanding director, Otto Preminger, who obviously

dynamically attractive stars in close-ups. In my opinion, close-ups are
a vitally important part of producing a real quality picture.<br><br>Another serious problem that plagued this film's story was that way-way
too many of its scenes set in the beautiful outdoors were actually shot
in front of back-projection screens. This, to me, was a sure-fire way
of thoroughly sabotaging an adventure film that featured such grand and
majestic scenery as this one did.<br><br>Set in the year 1875 - River Of No Return was something of a ""Father &amp;

in this film's climatic finale.<br><br>*Note Of Interest* - All of the exterior scenes for River Of No Return
were shot in the Canadian Rockies, which included Banff National Park,

Of all of Marilyn Monroe's leading men, Robert Mitchum was the only one
who knew her back when. In 1941 before he made his screen debut in a
Hopalong Cassidy film, Mitchum was among other things an aircraft
factory worker and one of his friends was one James Daugherty. Of
course Jim had a wife Norma Jean at the time and Bob and Dorothy
occasionally socialized.<br><br>He knew all about her psychological problems and when it came time to
do a film with her when both became screen legends, Mitchum was not
about to get himself involved. That probably helped because during the
shooting Marilyn and director Otto Preminger stopped speaking and would
only communicate through Mitchum. <br><br>Marilyn's a saloon gal involved with a no good gambler/drifter in Rory
Calhoun. Calhoun and Monroe nearly drown on a river when Mitchum
rescues them and their raft. No good deed goes unpunished so Calhoun
takes Mitchum's horse and Mitchum, Monroe, and Mitchum's son Tommy
Rettig use the raft to go after him. They're kind of forced to because
the Indians are on the warpath.<br><br>She's certainly quite a distraction for a man on a mission and at one
point Mitchum does give into lust ever so briefly. Which does make
River of No Return one of the more realistic westerns ever done.<br><br>Twentieth Century Fox decided to go whole hog on this one, shooting the
film up in Banff. But with Marilyn and Otto feuding it was not a happy
set. Otto walked off the picture and Jean Negulesco finished it out.
Joe DiMaggio flew up to the set because of rumors of Mitchum and
Marilyn, that were completely unfounded, but Joe was the jealous type.
As for Mitchum legend has it that he and another legendary drinker,
Murvyn Vye, killed many a bottle during the long evenings.<br><br>Done in cinemascope and 3-D, River of No Return should be seen on the
big screen. Not even a letterbox DVD does it justice. And 3-D was
definitely the medium for Monroe. Marilyn even has some nice songs to
sing in this one.<br><br>It's not a great western, still it's entertaining enough especially in
those rafting sequences. But it was a film Otto Preminger shuddered
about when recalling.

Cinemascope was at the height of popularity when Fox decided to cast Marilyn
Monroe and Robert Mitchum in a story set against the scenic splendor of the
Rockies. Marilyn even gets to sing a few fetching song numbers (her saloon
song atop a bar is a standout and she delivers a totally professional job).
Sleepy-eyed Mitchum makes a good partner for Monroe and little Tommy Rettig
scores as the adoring little boy who watches wistfully as Monroe strums a
song on her guitar.<br><br>Into the story, slight as it is, is an Indian attack while Mitchum and
Monroe battle the rapids. It's all very routine going, for the most part,
but the chance to see Monroe strut her stuff in a tight pair of jeans and
Mitchum give a sturdy, likeable performance is enough to make the movie a
pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. <br><br>Nothing great here, but a very satisfying performance by Marilyn who does a
more than competent job on her less than inspired songs. And the scenery
helps. <br><br>Otto Preminger's direction is not as taut as it should have been for a tale
of this sort--in fact, the whole film has a lumbering pace that seems to
make some parts of the story seem more like filler material than anything
else. And poor Rory Calhoun has little to do.

Otto Preminger's ""River of No Return"" is set in Northwest Canada, in
savage Indian territory, in the gold rush days... The plot is weak but
the scenery is spectacular and the action of the river dramatically
powerful... Otto Preminger knew how to create tension and threat in the
grandeur and menace of the Canadian Rockies <br><br>The film opens in the 1875 with widower Matt Calder (Mitchum), coming
to town, where his ten-year-old son Mark (Tommy Rettig) is waiting for
him... He has served a term in prison for shooting a man in the back,
even though he shot the man only to keep him from murdering a friend...
Mark has now been sent to join his father, who has bought a farm for
them...<br><br>Mark has made the acquaintance of Kay (Marilyn Monroe), a saloon
singer, while waiting for his father.... Calder thanks Kay for her
kindness to his boy, and father and son depart for their farm...<br><br>One day, Calder sees Kay and gambler Harry Weston (Rory Calhoun) in
trouble on a raft in the river near his home... He helps them ashore
and learns that Watson is in a hurry to get to town to register a gold
claim... So eager is he that he steals his rescuer's only horse, and
leaving his girl behind as well, rides away...<br><br>The predicament of those left is deepened by the fact that Indians are
on a rampage and are due to attack the farm at any moment... The only
way left to get to town is by a wild river...<br><br>Photographed in Technicolor and CinemaScope, the film is designed to
exploit the splendors of the mountains, trees and rapid rivers plus the
magnetic pleasant figure of Marilyn who is the only charming woman
surrounded by two handsome men and a charming kid...<br><br>Marilyn sings 4 numbers in the film: ""One Silver Dollar,"" ""I'm Gonna
File My Claim,"" ""Down in the Meadow,"" and ""The River of No Return."" The
little boy, Tommy Rettig, played another big-scale Western, Delmer
Daves' ""The Last Wagon,"" with Richard Widmark, Felicia Farr, and Susan
Kohner...

I just love this movie, except for that one scene (everybody knows
which one). It's a very good venue for Mitchum and perhaps the best
Monroe ever had. Really great actors make you forget that they are
either actors or stars. These two do that quite well in spite of a
loosely written script and a bit too much sweetness in the person of
the boy. I think I love this movie as much for the fact that someone
finally let Monroe act as I do for the fun of watching it. She did a
good job of bringing her character, rather than Marilyn, to the screen.
I enjoyed the scenes between her and the boy. She was very believable
as a nurturing, protective figure. She would have done well as an
actress. This movie is just a small sample.. Lonestar

An unexceptional story beautifully directed by Otto Premiger, whose handling
of this routine material makes it work as well in its way as the best of
Anthony Mann. A stolen rifle figures prominently in this western, as does an
Indian attack, the budding romance between a puritanical homesteader with a
past and a saloon singer in trouble, and of course the eponymous and
oftentimes violent river they raft down. The northwest scenery is
breathtaking. Preminger gives a nice drive to his narrative without
stressing any one element for too long. For a while it's a farmer-son story,
then a badman story, then there's a journey down the river, then a romance,
then an Indian attack. Scenes play out dramatically rather than
melodramatically despite the genre limitations of the script, and this shows
Preminger's steady hand. He doesn't mind making his movie a bit of a
travelogue or nature film if the mood strikes him, and therefore the picture
has a nice diversity, and many lovely things to look at. Chief among its
many scenic attractions is Marilyn Monroe in the female lead. I can't say
that this is her best performance but it's one of her best non-musical or
comedy roles that isn't too serious, which is to say it's not at all like
How To Marry a Millionaire, Bus Stop, The Prince and the Showgirl or The

And if this is mine, I couldn\'t imagine a better 15 minutes.      [on the Black Panthers movement of the 1960s] The goal of the government was to get all the leaders of the Black Panther Party in jail so that they could be killed systematically through prison violence, and that way they could stop what was a very powerful and evolving movement. I don\'t think we would have the kind of prison population now and what happens in this country with the gangs if the Panthers had been allowed to continue what they decided to do, which was basically empower black communities to take back their self-control and reestablish the dignity of being a black person in this country.      I was embarrassed by the director, Blake Edwards, who looked at me and said, ""What am I supposed to do with THAT?"". I was a little hurt to be referred to as an inanimate object at an audition. I was told by my agent that a number of big stars won\'t work with anyone two inches taller than them and most of them are under six feet, so you have to be prepared to have trouble.      Making the movie Babe (1995) opened my eyes to the intelligence and the inquisitive personalities of pigs. These highly social animals possess an amazing capacity for love, joy and sorrow that makes them remarkably similar to our beloved canine and feline friends.      [on the story of The Promise (2016)] The love story is a way of getting people to begin the process, to feel for the characters, and then understand... can we not have compassion for people who are suffering around the world today? If we can have compassion for them, we can have compassion for the Armenians. If we can have compassion for the Armenians, then we have compassion for the Native Americans, and it goes on... it\'s to open the heart. [2017]      [on his Oscar campaign for Babe (1995)] That year they had huge films and I said to the studio, \'I want to go for supporting actor,\' and they said, \'No, your name comes first.\' I said, \'Yeah, it comes first because you can\'t say, ""Babe, starring the pig and James Cromwell."" Of course you had to put me first.\' You know, they didn\'t help me at all. No campaign, no advertising, no nothing. It cost me $60,000 to get that nomination, but it changed my life.

 ""The Sum of All Fears"" is the latest film in the Jack Ryan series as
written by Tom Clancy. In the previous films, Ryan was presented as a family
man and played by Alex Baldwin and Harrison Ford. This time around we are
asked to accept a Ryan who is 25 years younger (Ben Affleck), unmarried and
a nerdy, wet behind the ears CIA historian. The age difference would have
been more believable had the film been set in 1973, when the story begins,
rather than the present.<br><br> Anyway, the story is about a disgruntled ex-Nazi, Dressler (Alan Bates) who
acquires a nuclear device and plans to instigate a war between the USA and
Russia and then take over when the super powers destroy each other. The new
Russian President, Nemerov (Ciaran Hinds) is set up by Dressler to be blamed
for a nuculear attack which wipes out a large part of Baltimore. U.S.
President Fowler (James Cromwell) calls in the CIA headed by William Cabot
(Morgan Freeman). <br><br> Cabot enlists the aide of historian Jack Ryan (Affleck) because Ryan has
done a thorough study on Nemerov. Ryan believes the Russian to be innocent
even though all around him believe him guilty. As each side prepares to
launch their respective missles, Ryan and CIA Operative John Clark (Liev
Schrieber) are busily gathering information and Ryan is racing against the
clock to convince Fowler of Nemenov's innocence.<br><br> Affleck tries his best to make us forget Harrison Ford but to no avail. He
simply cannot be taken seriously as the man who holds the world's fate in
his hands. Freeman is excellent as always and Cromwell and Hinds stand out
as the two world leaders. Bates makes a nasty villain and Schrieber is good
as the mysterious man with a past, Clark. Bridget Moynahan appears as
Affleck's love interest and future wife.<br><br> The real star of the picture are the special effects. The nuclear explosion
is realistic and believable and the attack on the aircraft carrier is
equally good.<br><br> I hope that in the next Jack Ryan movie, he is portrayed by someone who is
at least old enough to shave.

OK, I enjoyed the movie. But I also have read the book several times,
and the comparisons are inevitable, as several other people have done.<br><br>I just don't see the point of the most obvious changes from the novel :
why using a Neo Nazi fanatic instead of Middle East terrorists? why a
very young and single Jack Ryan instead of a married and older
character? (Harrison Ford would have been terrific again) Of course a
scene aboard Air Force One is more eye candy that a President trapped
on Camp David because of a storm and a damaged helicopter. And : where
is Ding Chavez??? A character from ""Clear and Present Danger"", is
almost adopted by John Clark after being rescued, and they work as
partners.<br><br>Some gaps on the story are too difficult to accept : you mean that the
ONLY person able to communicate that the bomb was not Russian, is a
obscure junior CIA adviser? what about all the agencies and personnel
deployed on the explosion site? are they all mute? (On the book, Ryan
passes the information but he is not believed by a hostile President
and his Nac.Sec. Adviser, *and* a possible power struggle on the
Russian government is completely left out).And how come that you can
link without any problem from a Palm in the middle of a burned city?

Let me preface my comments by saying that I loved Clancy's book when I
first
read it ten years ago.  It was a gripping page-turner, and a marvelously
intricate work, building suspense in layers.  I've since re-read it several
times.<br><br>I realistically expected that elements of the massive tome would have to be
changed or condensed for the screen version.  But so much is changed, and
so
many critical elements removed, that it hardly resembles its novel origins.
As a result I find it difficult to believe that Tom Clancy had much
creative
control over this effort, though he's credited as ""Executive Producer"".<br><br>First, for some inexplicable reason, this movie jumps away from previous
Clancy continuity by completely revamping the character of Jack Ryan.
Rather than a middle aged CIA administrator, Ryan is now a young handsome
PhD with little Washington experience.  Apparently this is to boost the
""chick-flick"" quotient of this outing, as it adds nothing tangible to the
film, and only detracts from the continuity that had been built to this
point.  There's even a scene where Kathy is asked how ""cute"" Ryan is on a
1-10 scale, and she says a ""12"".  Ugh! They had time to include this
garbage, yet skip vital character development later in the film?<br><br>Yet, even worse, this Ryan is the Uber-Ryan.  Yes, the man is everywhere,
and involved in virtually every action sequence in the film.  He finds the
bomb lab in Russia (and saves Clark, CLARK, for crying out loud, shouldn't
it be the OTHER way around???), races to Baltimore in a helicopter to warn
President Fowler(who in yet another huge change is caught in the blast
himself) he gets caught in the nuclear blast(and hardly gets his hair
mussed, how cliche!), he personally sifts through the rubble of Baltimore
for evidence (another inexplicable change, as Denver was the city nuked in
the book, then goes on for a cliched confrontation with the terrorists (who
are VERY poorly developed character-wise, totally unlike the book) mano y
mano in a darkened Baltimore warehouse.   Oh, and I almost forgot, there
was
the obligatory (and oh so overused) Hollywood ""death"" scene where Ryan
(again, Ryan personally) kneels at the bed of Morgan Freeman as he expires
in a ""tearful"" sequence.  Yes, it was painful but not in the way
intended.<br><br>I thought Clancy's books sometimes stretched the believablity of Ryan's
capabilities to the breaking point, yet this goes way beyond anything
Clancy
has previously done.   It's Super-Ryan to the rescue, more 007 than
distinguished, cerebral CIA analyst, even though he supposedly had little
if
any experience in espionage, forensics, or any of that.  It is very
cliched,
and very tiresome to watch, at least for anyone that's actually read the
books.<br><br>One of the best parts of the novel was the realism.  Reading it, you really
believed that the plot Clancy put in motion could occur.  Not this movie.
Believable Islamic terrorists were replaced with cartoonish middle-aged
white european neo-Nazis who make stock Hitler-loving speeches that any
avid
movie-goer has heard a million times before.  Dr. Evil would love these
guys.  They even got to kill one of their own rank, ala Dr. Evil, after he
experienced the convenient cinematic ""crisis of concience"".  You could see
it coming a mile away!  I guess that's so we can understand these men are
serious and mean ""business""<br><br>Oh and on the subject of business, since the typical european Neo-Nazi is
young, skinheaded, devoted, but not terribly affluent these Nazis were
conveniently well-to-do businessmen with the financial assets and
experience
to put their scheme in motion.  Is this Tom Clancy or James Bond?  I guess
its not ""politically correct"" to feature the actual type of real world
Middle Eastern ""gentlemen"", with the aid of foreign government sponsorship
who even now are striving, again in reality, to make weapons of mass
destruction to use against us?  I guess its always ""safe"" to once again
bash
caucasian conservative-appearing men in business suits.  Whatever the
reason, its another major plot element from the book down the
tubes.<br><br>On the subject of the bomb;  there was a great deal of detail in the book
about the bomb that was completely overlooked in the movie.  For example,
in
the book, the bomb was originally intended to be a multi-stage, ie,
HYDROGEN
bomb.  It fizzled.  The original yield was overestimated by twenty fold by
military analysts because of reflection of the snow, and other factors.
The
President's advisors didn't think terrorists could build a multi-stage
weapon, thus the suspicion was immediately upon the Russians. It was only
after frantic detective work that the true yield of the bomb was
discovered,
and it put Ryan on the proper track AND gave him leverage to help defuse
the
situation(no pun intended).  It's a common worry that terrorist groups
might
get ahold of a low yield fission ""suitcase"" bombs, yet right from the start
in the movie no one, including the President, suspects
terrorists!<br><br>Another fond memory I have of the book is that Clancy took us to the very
brink of Armageddon where the US and Russia were nearly in a shooting war
because of the misinterpreted size of the bomb, and the tank battle that
the
German terrorists cause to happen in Berlin.  Yet here, the Russians attack
and virtually destroy a US nuclear carrier, we bomb a Russian airbase, and
we're still standing at that brink.  Somehow, I think if events got that
far, there'd be no turning back.  Clancy seemed to know that when he wrote
the book;  he seems to have forgotten it here though.<br><br>These are just a few of the major problems with this film.  The pacing is
bad;  one minute the bomb is still being constructed, and a few minutes
later its already placed in Baltimore and about to explode, with the cliche
of Ryan hot on the trail, trying to warn the President.  In the book, the
bomb catches everyone completely off-guard, but not here, ANOTHER
irritating
change.  There is also very little character development, the President's
motivations are poorly understood, the paranoia of Fowler over the new
Russian President's motives was poorly developed, etc etc.<br><br>Avoid it if you can.  I turned the last 5 minutes off, it was so
bad.<br><br>

This is a ridiculous movie. First the casting of Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan
just doesn't make sense, chronologically (he's already been played by the
much older Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin) or physically  Affleck just
isn't commanding enough for the role. Secondly the movie is simply
capitalizing on North America's new found fear of terrorism on home turf,
and thirdly the screenwriter Paul Attanasio took huge liberties with the Tom
Clancy novel, including, in a stroke of misguided political correctness,
changing the bad guys from Middle Eastern to Nazis. Of course everyone hates
Nazis, so the filmmakers are not going to offend anyone (Hollywood finds it
so hard to get good hateful villains now that Russia is no longer communist)
but are we to believe that there is a worldwide conspiracy by super-rich and
powerful Nazis to pit two world powers against one another? And how, after
the blast (yes, there is a huge atomic explosion), does Ben Affleck piece
together this entire conspiracy using only a cell phone and a palm pilot?
I'm willing to suspend disbelief in most movies, but this movie has holes
big enough to fly a jet through.

This film was a far cry from the book by Tom Clancy, who wrote about Al
Queda terrorists reading a set off a nuclear bomb in America. The
latter must have been sick watching this movie and typically-Left Wing
Hollywood changed the script to being one with Nazis as the villains
instead.<br><br>Are you kidding me? How ridiculously politically correct is that? If I
had known this beforehand, I would have boycotted this insulting movie,
instead of wasting money on it.<br><br>Also, at least to me, Harrison Ford will always be ""Jack Ryan,"" not
some second-rate pretty- boy actor like Ben Affleck. <br><br>The only redeeming qualities to this film were the nice cinematography
and the awesome sound when the big bomb went off. If you have a
surround sound, that scene will rock your room. Too bad, they didn't
blow up this film before it was released.

As usual, I am very glad I saw the movie BEFORE I read the reviews on
this site. Why do soooo many reviewers here have to compare the movie
to the book? A book allows 300-400 pages (or more) to develop plots and
characters. We are reviewing movies on IMDb, not books. I guess
reviewers here want to appear erudite by scraping up details from the
book that get omitted or distorted on the screen. I am a very active
reader, but I simply cannot read every book that makes it to the movie
theatres. Writing a book (a fairly isolated event) is a significantly
different event than producing a movie which involves countless people
and issues: screenwriters, actors, writers, directors, production
people, locations, etc., etc. Making all these book to movie
comparisons isn't fair to the movie or the book. Many times I just want
to watch a movie and judge it on its merits alone - as a movie, period.
I did not read this book, but I watched the movie and found it very
entertaining and extremely absorbing.

 ""The Sum of All Fears,"" based on the # 1 New York Times bestselling novel
by Tom Clancy, features Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan, a historian who somehow or
another, by writing a paper on the new Russian leader, is spotted by the CIA
Deputy Director (Morgan Freeman). <br><br> ""The Sum of All Fears"" is even more powerful in this day and age, but
nevertheless, it stands nowhere near as great as the novel, which is usually
the case with films taken from books. In the following I will point out some
differences that weren't crucial to my opinion on the film, but just
interesting.<br><br> The film is a prequel to the other Jack Ryan films, while the novel was a
sequel to the other books. In the book, a lost Israeli nuclear warhead is
picked up by Arabs some twenty years after the war it was lost in. In the
film, a modern-age Hitler is attempting to begin turmoil between Russia and
the U.S. with the nuke -- there are no arabs. Also in the novel, the way the
bomb was sneaked into the superbowl was much more interesting than the
method they used in the film. Also, in the book, Morgan Freeman's character
was a dumb man who hid throughout the novel. In the film he's a
hero.<br><br> There's countless other things that don't really matter, but still made me
a bit disappointed in the film.<br><br> The film was in no way awful, and is the best Tom Clancy movie to date, but
it's still not as good as the book.<br><br>3.5/5 stars --<br><br>John Ulmer
</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>

Final Score: 4.0 (out of 10)<br><br>The movie adaptation of Tom Clancy's ""The Sum of All Fears"" might be a
starkly frightening movie, could be a cautionary tale of homeland terrorism
and nuclear war - that is, if it wasn't caught in the confounding cinematic
time-warp it finds itself in. It is primarily set after the fall of the
Berlin wall and the end of the nuclear arms race with the Russians, however
it's also a prequel with a younger, cocky Jack Ryan (plug-in flavor of the
month Ben Affleck) and with the  principle villains being Nazis. This movie
will probably be remembered more for it's unfortunate post-9/11 release date
(which gave it a sense of importance) then the silly story and content. It's
not even so much that the Nazis-as-bad-guys thing is an overused, now out of
date cliche as much as the idea that they were Middle Eastern terrorists in
Clancy's book and the writers and director Phil Robinson changed them smacks
of pure political correctness. Nobody wants to offend the terrorists. As a
result the movie feels phony. And that's a big problem because we feel
detached from it and, thus, don't feel it is as sharp, timely and intense as
Clancy meant it to be. The reason that movies like ""Fail Safe"" and ""Dr.
Strangelove"" were so brilliant is because they were gutsy enough to take on
the public's fears directly. This movie isn't, in fact, it goes out of it's
way to hide in it's phony world from doing anything gutsy. All movie
villains have to be white Anglo Saxon Europeans most likely with `sinister'
Russian or German accents. This type of stuff might frighten liberal
Hollywood types who think the president might drop nukes at any moment, but
it's not going to resonate with most people. <br><br>It also doesn't help that we can't connect with the characters. Affleck does
a fine job or running around yelling, but there isn't a lot of development
in the young Ryan or in any character we meet. Robinson's direction is
purely rudimentary. The whole thing has the feel of a clumsy TV movie. It's
race-against-the-clock gives us no real payoff. There is exactly one really
good scene here involving Morgan Freeman, a cell phone and a stadium full of
people. It also has one interesting little monologue about how the internet
and technology has connected terrorism globally like never before. But
without any characters, eye-candy action or resonating story we're left
pondering why we wasted our time on this thing. <br><br>Alternate viewing recommendation: ""24 - Season 2"". Kiefer Sutherland's Jack
Bauer runs circles around Ryan in generally the same plot only more intense,
frighteningly timely and on a more epic scale.

I have read every Jack Ryan book and loved each one. Unfortunately
someone always decides to make a movie out of it. How Clancy hasn't
b*tch-slapped someone yet is beyond me. <br><br>How the movies fare so far.. Patriot Games.. acceptable. Hunt For Red
October.. One of my favorites,even if different from the book, it
basically got it right. Clear and Present Danger.. that's where things
really started to jump the track, and fiction crept its way into an
already fictionalized story.<br><br>But this one... this one is truly a horrible horrible event for
literate people the world over. I won't list every detail changed and
mutilated from a once great story, but suffice it to say this movie is
basically in name only a representation of the book. All other details
are conveniently changed or overlooked.<br><br>I understand that Clancy books are involved and takes some
effort/intelligence to keep with the complex plots, but they always
come to a great point, and leave me wanting more. This movie does not.

I read the book ""The Sum of All Fears"" with fascination--Palestenians
discover an Isreali nuclear device lost when the aircraft is shot down in
the six day war, sell it to Al Queda, and the arab terrorists proceed to
blow up Denver with said nuke.<br><br>I was very much looking forward to this movie, only to find that for fear
of
offending Al Queda, the director and screenwriters had substituted some
ridiculous plot about German Nazi's and turned the whole thing into a
melodramatic hash.<br><br>This could have been a GREAT, prophetic, movie.  instead it became a silly
waste of money and talent.  I know Tom Clancy hated the movie, so did I.

 ""The Sum of All Fears"" is the latest film in the Jack Ryan series as
written by Tom Clancy. In the previous films, Ryan was presented as a family
man and played by Alex Baldwin and Harrison Ford. This time around we are
asked to accept a Ryan who is 25 years younger (Ben Affleck), unmarried and
a nerdy, wet behind the ears CIA historian. The age difference would have
been more believable had the film been set in 1973, when the story begins,
rather than the present.<br><br> Anyway, the story is about a disgruntled ex-Nazi, Dressler (Alan Bates) who
acquires a nuclear device and plans to instigate a war between the USA and
Russia and then take over when the super powers destroy each other. The new
Russian President, Nemerov (Ciaran Hinds) is set up by Dressler to be blamed
for a nuculear attack which wipes out a large part of Baltimore. U.S.
President Fowler (James Cromwell) calls in the CIA headed by William Cabot
(Morgan Freeman). <br><br> Cabot enlists the aide of historian Jack Ryan (Affleck) because Ryan has
done a thorough study on Nemerov. Ryan believes the Russian to be innocent
even though all around him believe him guilty. As each side prepares to
launch their respective missles, Ryan and CIA Operative John Clark (Liev
Schrieber) are busily gathering information and Ryan is racing against the
clock to convince Fowler of Nemenov's innocence.<br><br> Affleck tries his best to make us forget Harrison Ford but to no avail. He
simply cannot be taken seriously as the man who holds the world's fate in
his hands. Freeman is excellent as always and Cromwell and Hinds stand out
as the two world leaders. Bates makes a nasty villain and Schrieber is good
as the mysterious man with a past, Clark. Bridget Moynahan appears as
Affleck's love interest and future wife.<br><br> The real star of the picture are the special effects. The nuclear explosion
is realistic and believable and the attack on the aircraft carrier is
equally good.<br><br> I hope that in the next Jack Ryan movie, he is portrayed by someone who is
at least old enough to shave.

OK, I enjoyed the movie. But I also have read the book several times,
and the comparisons are inevitable, as several other people have done.<br><br>I just don't see the point of the most obvious changes from the novel :
why using a Neo Nazi fanatic instead of Middle East terrorists? why a
very young and single Jack Ryan instead of a married and older
character? (Harrison Ford would have been terrific again) Of course a
scene aboard Air Force One is more eye candy that a President trapped
on Camp David because of a storm and a damaged helicopter. And : where
is Ding Chavez??? A character from ""Clear and Present Danger"", is
almost adopted by John Clark after being rescued, and they work as
partners.<br><br>Some gaps on the story are too difficult to accept : you mean that the
ONLY person able to communicate that the bomb was not Russian, is a
obscure junior CIA adviser? what about all the agencies and personnel
deployed on the explosion site? are they all mute? (On the book, Ryan
passes the information but he is not believed by a hostile President
and his Nac.Sec. Adviser, *and* a possible power struggle on the
Russian government is completely left out).And how come that you can
link without any problem from a Palm in the middle of a burned city?

Let me preface my comments by saying that I loved Clancy's book when I
first
read it ten years ago.  It was a gripping page-turner, and a marvelously
intricate work, building suspense in layers.  I've since re-read it several
times.<br><br>I realistically expected that elements of the massive tome would have to be
changed or condensed for the screen version.  But so much is changed, and
so
many critical elements removed, that it hardly resembles its novel origins.
As a result I find it difficult to believe that Tom Clancy had much
creative
control over this effort, though he's credited as ""Executive Producer"".<br><br>First, for some inexplicable reason, this movie jumps away from previous
Clancy continuity by completely revamping the character of Jack Ryan.
Rather than a middle aged CIA administrator, Ryan is now a young handsome
PhD with little Washington experience.  Apparently this is to boost the
""chick-flick"" quotient of this outing, as it adds nothing tangible to the
film, and only detracts from the continuity that had been built to this
point.  There's even a scene where Kathy is asked how ""cute"" Ryan is on a
1-10 scale, and she says a ""12"".  Ugh! They had time to include this
garbage, yet skip vital character development later in the film?<br><br>Yet, even worse, this Ryan is the Uber-Ryan.  Yes, the man is everywhere,
and involved in virtually every action sequence in the film.  He finds the
bomb lab in Russia (and saves Clark, CLARK, for crying out loud, shouldn't
it be the OTHER way around???), races to Baltimore in a helicopter to warn
President Fowler(who in yet another huge change is caught in the blast
himself) he gets caught in the nuclear blast(and hardly gets his hair
mussed, how cliche!), he personally sifts through the rubble of Baltimore
for evidence (another inexplicable change, as Denver was the city nuked in
the book, then goes on for a cliched confrontation with the terrorists (who
are VERY poorly developed character-wise, totally unlike the book) mano y
mano in a darkened Baltimore warehouse.   Oh, and I almost forgot, there
was
the obligatory (and oh so overused) Hollywood ""death"" scene where Ryan
(again, Ryan personally) kneels at the bed of Morgan Freeman as he expires
in a ""tearful"" sequence.  Yes, it was painful but not in the way
intended.<br><br>I thought Clancy's books sometimes stretched the believablity of Ryan's
capabilities to the breaking point, yet this goes way beyond anything
Clancy
has previously done.   It's Super-Ryan to the rescue, more 007 than
distinguished, cerebral CIA analyst, even though he supposedly had little
if
any experience in espionage, forensics, or any of that.  It is very
cliched,
and very tiresome to watch, at least for anyone that's actually read the
books.<br><br>One of the best parts of the novel was the realism.  Reading it, you really
believed that the plot Clancy put in motion could occur.  Not this movie.
Believable Islamic terrorists were replaced with cartoonish middle-aged
white european neo-Nazis who make stock Hitler-loving speeches that any
avid
movie-goer has heard a million times before.  Dr. Evil would love these
guys.  They even got to kill one of their own rank, ala Dr. Evil, after he
experienced the convenient cinematic ""crisis of concience"".  You could see
it coming a mile away!  I guess that's so we can understand these men are
serious and mean ""business""<br><br>Oh and on the subject of business, since the typical european Neo-Nazi is
young, skinheaded, devoted, but not terribly affluent these Nazis were
conveniently well-to-do businessmen with the financial assets and
experience
to put their scheme in motion.  Is this Tom Clancy or James Bond?  I guess
its not ""politically correct"" to feature the actual type of real world
Middle Eastern ""gentlemen"", with the aid of foreign government sponsorship
who even now are striving, again in reality, to make weapons of mass
destruction to use against us?  I guess its always ""safe"" to once again
bash
caucasian conservative-appearing men in business suits.  Whatever the
reason, its another major plot element from the book down the
tubes.<br><br>On the subject of the bomb;  there was a great deal of detail in the book
about the bomb that was completely overlooked in the movie.  For example,
in
the book, the bomb was originally intended to be a multi-stage, ie,
HYDROGEN
bomb.  It fizzled.  The original yield was overestimated by twenty fold by
military analysts because of reflection of the snow, and other factors.
The
President's advisors didn't think terrorists could build a multi-stage
weapon, thus the suspicion was immediately upon the Russians. It was only
after frantic detective work that the true yield of the bomb was
discovered,
and it put Ryan on the proper track AND gave him leverage to help defuse
the
situation(no pun intended).  It's a common worry that terrorist groups
might
get ahold of a low yield fission ""suitcase"" bombs, yet right from the start
in the movie no one, including the President, suspects
terrorists!<br><br>Another fond memory I have of the book is that Clancy took us to the very
brink of Armageddon where the US and Russia were nearly in a shooting war
because of the misinterpreted size of the bomb, and the tank battle that
the
German terrorists cause to happen in Berlin.  Yet here, the Russians attack
and virtually destroy a US nuclear carrier, we bomb a Russian airbase, and
we're still standing at that brink.  Somehow, I think if events got that
far, there'd be no turning back.  Clancy seemed to know that when he wrote
the book;  he seems to have forgotten it here though.<br><br>These are just a few of the major problems with this film.  The pacing is
bad;  one minute the bomb is still being constructed, and a few minutes
later its already placed in Baltimore and about to explode, with the cliche
of Ryan hot on the trail, trying to warn the President.  In the book, the
bomb catches everyone completely off-guard, but not here, ANOTHER
irritating
change.  There is also very little character development, the President's
motivations are poorly understood, the paranoia of Fowler over the new
Russian President's motives was poorly developed, etc etc.<br><br>Avoid it if you can.  I turned the last 5 minutes off, it was so
bad.<br><br>

This is a ridiculous movie. First the casting of Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan
just doesn't make sense, chronologically (he's already been played by the
much older Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin) or physically  Affleck just
isn't commanding enough for the role. Secondly the movie is simply
capitalizing on North America's new found fear of terrorism on home turf,
and thirdly the screenwriter Paul Attanasio took huge liberties with the Tom
Clancy novel, including, in a stroke of misguided political correctness,
changing the bad guys from Middle Eastern to Nazis. Of course everyone hates
Nazis, so the filmmakers are not going to offend anyone (Hollywood finds it
so hard to get good hateful villains now that Russia is no longer communist)
but are we to believe that there is a worldwide conspiracy by super-rich and
powerful Nazis to pit two world powers against one another? And how, after
the blast (yes, there is a huge atomic explosion), does Ben Affleck piece
together this entire conspiracy using only a cell phone and a palm pilot?
I'm willing to suspend disbelief in most movies, but this movie has holes
big enough to fly a jet through.

This film was a far cry from the book by Tom Clancy, who wrote about Al
Queda terrorists reading a set off a nuclear bomb in America. The
latter must have been sick watching this movie and typically-Left Wing
Hollywood changed the script to being one with Nazis as the villains
instead.<br><br>Are you kidding me? How ridiculously politically correct is that? If I
had known this beforehand, I would have boycotted this insulting movie,
instead of wasting money on it.<br><br>Also, at least to me, Harrison Ford will always be ""Jack Ryan,"" not
some second-rate pretty- boy actor like Ben Affleck. <br><br>The only redeeming qualities to this film were the nice cinematography
and the awesome sound when the big bomb went off. If you have a
surround sound, that scene will rock your room. Too bad, they didn't
blow up this film before it was released.

As usual, I am very glad I saw the movie BEFORE I read the reviews on
this site. Why do soooo many reviewers here have to compare the movie
to the book? A book allows 300-400 pages (or more) to develop plots and
characters. We are reviewing movies on IMDb, not books. I guess
reviewers here want to appear erudite by scraping up details from the
book that get omitted or distorted on the screen. I am a very active
reader, but I simply cannot read every book that makes it to the movie
theatres. Writing a book (a fairly isolated event) is a significantly
different event than producing a movie which involves countless people
and issues: screenwriters, actors, writers, directors, production
people, locations, etc., etc. Making all these book to movie
comparisons isn't fair to the movie or the book. Many times I just want
to watch a movie and judge it on its merits alone - as a movie, period.
I did not read this book, but I watched the movie and found it very
entertaining and extremely absorbing.

 ""The Sum of All Fears,"" based on the # 1 New York Times bestselling novel
by Tom Clancy, features Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan, a historian who somehow or
another, by writing a paper on the new Russian leader, is spotted by the CIA
Deputy Director (Morgan Freeman). <br><br> ""The Sum of All Fears"" is even more powerful in this day and age, but
nevertheless, it stands nowhere near as great as the novel, which is usually
the case with films taken from books. In the following I will point out some
differences that weren't crucial to my opinion on the film, but just
interesting.<br><br> The film is a prequel to the other Jack Ryan films, while the novel was a
sequel to the other books. In the book, a lost Israeli nuclear warhead is
picked up by Arabs some twenty years after the war it was lost in. In the
film, a modern-age Hitler is attempting to begin turmoil between Russia and
the U.S. with the nuke -- there are no arabs. Also in the novel, the way the
bomb was sneaked into the superbowl was much more interesting than the
method they used in the film. Also, in the book, Morgan Freeman's character
was a dumb man who hid throughout the novel. In the film he's a
hero.<br><br> There's countless other things that don't really matter, but still made me
a bit disappointed in the film.<br><br> The film was in no way awful, and is the best Tom Clancy movie to date, but
it's still not as good as the book.<br><br>3.5/5 stars --<br><br>John Ulmer

Final Score: 4.0 (out of 10)<br><br>The movie adaptation of Tom Clancy's ""The Sum of All Fears"" might be a
starkly frightening movie, could be a cautionary tale of homeland terrorism
and nuclear war - that is, if it wasn't caught in the confounding cinematic
time-warp it finds itself in. It is primarily set after the fall of the
Berlin wall and the end of the nuclear arms race with the Russians, however
it's also a prequel with a younger, cocky Jack Ryan (plug-in flavor of the
month Ben Affleck) and with the  principle villains being Nazis. This movie
will probably be remembered more for it's unfortunate post-9/11 release date
(which gave it a sense of importance) then the silly story and content. It's
not even so much that the Nazis-as-bad-guys thing is an overused, now out of
date cliche as much as the idea that they were Middle Eastern terrorists in
Clancy's book and the writers and director Phil Robinson changed them smacks
of pure political correctness. Nobody wants to offend the terrorists. As a
result the movie feels phony. And that's a big problem because we feel
detached from it and, thus, don't feel it is as sharp, timely and intense as
Clancy meant it to be. The reason that movies like ""Fail Safe"" and ""Dr.
Strangelove"" were so brilliant is because they were gutsy enough to take on
the public's fears directly. This movie isn't, in fact, it goes out of it's
way to hide in it's phony world from doing anything gutsy. All movie
villains have to be white Anglo Saxon Europeans most likely with `sinister'
Russian or German accents. This type of stuff might frighten liberal
Hollywood types who think the president might drop nukes at any moment, but
it's not going to resonate with most people. <br><br>It also doesn't help that we can't connect with the characters. Affleck does
a fine job or running around yelling, but there isn't a lot of development
in the young Ryan or in any character we meet. Robinson's direction is
purely rudimentary. The whole thing has the feel of a clumsy TV movie. It's
race-against-the-clock gives us no real payoff. There is exactly one really
good scene here involving Morgan Freeman, a cell phone and a stadium full of
people. It also has one interesting little monologue about how the internet
and technology has connected terrorism globally like never before. But
without any characters, eye-candy action or resonating story we're left
pondering why we wasted our time on this thing. <br><br>Alternate viewing recommendation: ""24 - Season 2"". Kiefer Sutherland's Jack
Bauer runs circles around Ryan in generally the same plot only more intense,
frighteningly timely and on a more epic scale.

I have read every Jack Ryan book and loved each one. Unfortunately
someone always decides to make a movie out of it. How Clancy hasn't
b*tch-slapped someone yet is beyond me. <br><br>How the movies fare so far.. Patriot Games.. acceptable. Hunt For Red
October.. One of my favorites,even if different from the book, it
basically got it right. Clear and Present Danger.. that's where things
really started to jump the track, and fiction crept its way into an
already fictionalized story.<br><br>But this one... this one is truly a horrible horrible event for
literate people the world over. I won't list every detail changed and
mutilated from a once great story, but suffice it to say this movie is
basically in name only a representation of the book. All other details
are conveniently changed or overlooked.<br><br>I understand that Clancy books are involved and takes some
effort/intelligence to keep with the complex plots, but they always
come to a great point, and leave me wanting more. This movie does not.

I found out early I could make more money modeling than I could waitressing and scooping Häagen-Dazs. But I always wanted to be an actress.      I\'m spontaneous. I love going from one thing to something else and not knowing what I\'m going to do next.      As a mom, I can\'t imagine how hard it would be to hear hurtful things, untrue things being said about my daughters.      Everyone says I\'m exploiting the kids, but they haven\'t even seen one episode.      [on having her young daughters on her television program] I\'m in a no-win situation. If I have my kids on the show, I\'m exploiting them. If I don\'t, people will think I\'m not a hands-on mom.      [on her ex-husband Charlie Sheen] I didn\'t go into this marriage with the idea of just trying it out. I fell in love and wanted to make a new life with him. A lot of people said to me, ""How could you go out with someone with his past?"". But I\'ve always believe that everyone deserves a second chance.

I ask: Are they someone I want to wake up to in the morning and go to bed with at night? Do they question my assumptions about life? Consume me to distraction?

I grew up in a storytelling-rich community. It is important to me as a consumer of art and I guess in some ways a wannabe artist to continue that tradition, and acting is my chosen genre at this point to do that.

There's seems to be a lot of misplaced animosity among, what I presume,
are ""white"" commentators, regarding this film's racial thrust.<br><br>The film isn't about belittling or ridiculing ""white people.""<br><br>The film is about tackling prejudices: And specifically those among the
U.S.'s so-called ""white"" and ""black"" populations, but told from,
ostensibly, a ""black"" perspective, and told with humor.<br><br>Reading the negative comments on this film I wonder what movie some of

traits to establish social superiority over another person, or group of
people, who don't look like themselves. I saw nothing of any of the

fact that they believe this film makes ALL so-called ""white persons""

what you see in this film, then maybe you shouldn't be watching movies

to tackle a social problem with good humor. If you're offended by the
jokes in this film, then you've completely missed the point, and are,
in fact, the racist idiot that you claim this film to be (I believe
psychologist call this phenomenon ""projection,"" where someone refuses
to acknowledge their own faults, and casts their own negative qualities
on people they dislike).<br><br>But to the movie; it was hilarious. Myself, not being black, I couldn't
help but laugh of the number of stereotypes this film poked fun at;
especially ""Conspiracy Brother"" (played by Dave Chappell), whose loose
form of illogic-thinking and one-liners had me, quite literally,
falling out of my chair with laughter. And Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie
Howser M.D. fame) playing the ""affirmative action"" intern nearly bust
my gut, particularly near the end of the film. And Chris Kattan as the
evil high energy second in command was just brilliant. The entire cast
and film was superb. Think ""Shaft"" meets ""Get Smart"" here. :-)<br><br>What this film needed was to poke more fun at itself in a more direct
manner. In a large sense this film pokes fun at itself in terms of its
genre, but I think it also needed to show a couple more stereotypes.
One of the great ""high-profile"" stereotypes in white America are black
people talking in theaters, or otherwise being loud and obnoxious in
places and circumstances ""white"" Americans thinks inappropriate. It
would've been nice to see Undercover Brother cleaning up ""his peoples""
stereotypes, but doing so with humor before going after ""the man."" <br><br>I think that's a thing the film makers missed, because the other thing
I believe ""angry white commentators"" are bothered by is the fact that
there are ""black"" folks who have their own prejudices, and that this
film might seen by that segment of black-America as a green light for
ridiculing ""whites."" IT ISN'T.<br><br>One of the other themes the film makers missed is the coupling that
that occurs between Denise Richard's character and Eddie Griffin's
character. One of the primary drives of racism is the abhorrence of
interracial couples. This plot point, even though it's high comedy,
seemed implausible for a racially motivated antagonist. Then again,
that may've been part of the film makers' strategy to show how
ludicrous racial prejudice is, and can be.<br><br>The final mistake, and this is more of a minor quibble, but a profound
one from a fan of this film, was the downplay of Jim Kelley's role in
this film.<br><br>Where I grew up Jim Kelley was a hero, and this was amongst a circle of
friends who were all white. I think the marketing decision to ace Jim
Kelley's role in this film was a mistake. Not a huge one, but a mistake
nonetheless.<br><br>If you're still of the opinion that this film is racist (assuming
you've read this far and haven't burst a blood vessel), then I would
suggest you're taking the film too personally, because the film isn't
ridiculing so-called ""white-people,"" but prejudice that, in this case,
is assumed by a large chunk of white America. If you think otherwise,
then you're not viewing this film with a clear mind.<br><br>Beyond that, it's one of the funniest films I've ever seen. View it
with a relaxed and open mind, and enjoy some of the biggest laughs to
ever hit the big screen.

""Undercover Brother"" is one of the most hilarious and silly comedies I
have ever seen, and very underrated in IMDb. The story is a big joke
with the North American racism, both white and black, with very funny
situations ""à la Austin Powers"". I believe this is the major point of
the plot, keeping a neutral position and ridiculing and satirizing
racism of Caucasians and Blacks. Dave Chappelle is the funniest, but
Chris Kattan, Eddie Griffin, Aunjanue Ellis, Denise Richards and the
rest of the cast are also amazingly funny. I did not understand the
joke with mayonnaise, but I believe that usually Afro-American people
do not like this dressing, or at least there is a clichés about in USA.
There are many other jokes related to the North American culture that
are impossible to be understood by an overseas viewer, but anyway I
loved this movie. My vote is eight.<br><br>Title (Brazil): ""Undercover Brother  Com a Cor e a Coragem""

I loved ""Undercover Brother!""  It's the movie ""Pootie Tang"" should have
been!  I found it over-the-top, laugh-out-loud funny!  Eddie Griffin scores
as Undercover Brother, an afrolicious version of Austin Powers.  And Chris
Kattan is hilarious as Mr. Feather, an evil underling of The Man, devoted to
the white man's dominance, but succumbing to hip-hop influence.  Other funny
performances came from Dave Chappelle as the paranoid Conspiracy Brother,
and Neil Patrick Harris as the clueless caucasian intern Lance.  Some
viewers may complain about the black stereotypes, but you must look at it as
black actors and filmmakers laughing at themselves.  It's all a ""solid""
laugh!

Undercover Brother is a smart and sassy comedy similar to Austin Powers.
Eddie Griffin stars as Undercover Brother a smooth seceret agent type cat
who is out to save the world from the Man. He gets help from the brother
hood who have employess with names like Conspiracy Brother &amp; Smart Brother
and Sistah Girl. The supporting cast of Chi McBride, Chris Kattan and
Denise
Richards are all very good but Dave Chapple steals every scene he's in.
Malcom D.Lee has made a worthy follow up to The Best Man and Unisversal may
have a new franchise on their hands.

If you find 'Family Guy', 'Married ... with Children' or even 'The
Simpsons' to be in bad taste, you may want to avoid this movie. If you
found 'Good Times' and 'What's Happening!' to be stereotypical and
buffoonish, you probably won't like this movie.<br><br>If you are still reading ...<br><br>According to this movie, African Americans have made numerous advances
as a result of the Civil Rights movement. But a powerful Caucasian male
known as 'The Man', whose face we never see, wants to put black people
back in their place.<br><br>Which is why the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. must stop him.<br><br>If there was such a person as 'The Man', he could have written this
movie.<br><br>Eddie Griffin did quite a good job in what were essentially two roles.
Most of the time, he had the giant afro and the cool clothes and the
classic Cadillac pumping out funky 70s music as he represented
everything good (or bad, depending on your view) about the
'blaxploitiation' genre. And he worked undercover as Anton Jackson
wearing a suit and acting more white than I do. A very good contrast,
showing a lot of acting skill.<br><br>Billy Dee Williams nailed the potential presidential candidate
obviously based on Colin Powell, who was acting very strange for some
reason. Not quite stereotypical, because he was always dignified--but
shouldn't have been. His advertising campaign was hilarious!<br><br>Denise Richards and Aunjanue Ellis also gave good performances as the
two female partners of Undercover Brother--one when he was black, and
one when he was undercover.<br><br>Chi McBride and Gary Anthony Williams were very funny as two of
Undercover Brother's associates. And Dave Chappelle was very
stereotypical, very racist, but very funny--it was just satire, after
all. Neil Patrick Harris did quite a good job as the organization's
token white. And let's not forget the one associate of 'The Man' who
seemed to want to be black and even acted black at times. That must
have been Chris Kattan.<br><br>With all these talented actors, there were of course very clever
writers to make the material so hilarious. It takes real talent to
produce satire as opposed to just being mean-spirited.<br><br>The music was good too, for this type of movie. I personally would like
to have heard Jay-Z do Lawrence Welk. Or maybe not. Today's artists
don't often sound as good as, say, Rod Stewart. I'm not hopeless,
though. I can't stand Michael Bolton or Celine Dion or, even though he
wasn't mentioned but could have been, Kenny G. For some reason I do
like 'Jungle Boogie' by Kool and the Gang.<br><br>I highly recommend this movie for fans of satire.

These days, we're all used to the weekly deluge of movies adapted from
novels, comics and other mediums, but 'Undercover Brother'  released
in 2003 - was one of the first movies to be adapted from an internet
source. The film is based on a series of internet-based short animated
episodes, also called 'Undercover Brother'. The adaptation is
successful (with some scenes lifted directly from the animated shorts),
focusing on racial stereotypes while paying homage to spy movies and
seventies blaxploitation films.<br><br>Eddie Griffin is brilliant as the confident, swaggering, yet
good-hearted title character, who is called into the
B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D organisation to stop The Man after he kidnapped
presidential hopeful General Warren Boutwell (Billy Dee Williams) and
brainwashed him to sell fried chicken, with an aim to wipe out the
black community.<br><br>One of the strengths of this movie is the cast. Aside from the
aforementioned Griffin and Williams, there's Dave Chappelle as
Conspiracy Brother, in a role not dissimilar to his stand-up routine
(in this case a good thing), Gary Anthony Williams (who provided many
of the voices in the original internet series) as Smart Brother,
Aujanue Ellis as the headstrong Sistah Girl, the backbone of the group,
Neil Patrick Harris (before his breakout roles in the 'Harold and
Kumar' movies and 'How I Met Your Mother') as the
B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D's white intern Lance, Chris Kattan as Mr.
Feather, the underling to The Man who is secretly enchanted by black
culture, Denise Richards as White She-Devil, described as 'the black
man's kryptonite', and a cameo from James Brown, the Godfather of Soul.<br><br>While there is a lot of silly humour in this film (like the 'Austin
Powers' trilogy) and broad racial stereotypes  black people like fried
chicken and hate mayonnaise  the black director Malcolm D. Lee, and
the predominantly black cast ensures the black characters are never
mocked for a cheap laugh.<br><br>The soundtrack is a highlight, with a lot of songs from the
blaxploitation era, some Michael Jackson and more modern urban music.
Even if you're not a fan of this genre of music, it's still fairly
catchy.<br><br>Though it's very much a comedy (at times very silly but never stupid),
the film has a lot to say about how ridiculous racial stereotypes are.
The role of Boutwell as the possible first black president is relevant
to modern viewers (even though the film's only six years old) with the
presidency of Barack Obama only a few months old.<br><br>Overall, 'Undercover Brother' is a hilarious, silly film, which pays
homage to the spy and blaxploitation genre and explores racial
stereotypes without ridiculing them for cheap laughs.

I first saw ""Undercover Brother"" on cable a few years ago and since
then it's become one of my favorite comedies of recent years. Though
it's basically a ""blaxploited"" version of the ""Austin Powers"" concept,
""Undercover Brother"" is funny enough to be enjoyable on its own merits.<br><br>As the film opens, we are filled in on the ongoing battle between the
black community and a super secret organization known as ""The Man,"" who
works tirelessly to negate African-American influence on the world at
large. Fortunately, the black community has its own underground group,
known as ""The B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D."" created to undermine The Man's
plans to ""Whitewash"" the world.<br><br>Eddie Griffin stars as Undercover Brother, a funky '70s throwback hero
with a huge Afro and platform shoes, who drives around in a pimped-out
Caddy performing acts of Kung-Fu derring-do to aid the African American
cause. Normally a lone wolf, he is drafted into the
B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. when a black war hero (Billy Dee Williams)'s
plans to run for President are derailed by a mind control drug designed
by The Man. Now rather than run for the White House, he runs a
nationwide Fried Chicken chain instead. Ably assisted by fellow
B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. agents Sistah Girl, Conspiracy Brother, Smart
Brother, and ""Lance"" (Neil Patrick Harris in a hilarious turn as the
lone white member of the group -- he got his internship through -- what
else? -- affirmative action), Undercover Brother infiltrates The Man's
organization to destroy the plot, though he nearly becomes a victim of
their most potent weapon, the gorgeous Denise Richards, aka ""White
She-Devil"" (whom ""The Man"" calls ""Black Man's Kryptonite."") along the
way.<br><br>I have seen a lot of discussion on IMDb about this film being ""racist""
towards whites, but to be honest, I found ""Undercover Brother"" to be an
equal opportunity offender, with no stereotype about blacks OR whites
going un-skewered. The cast is excellent, especially Dave Chapelle as
the eternally paranoid agent ""Conspiracy Brother,"" and the always
welcome Chi McBride as the long-suffering ""Chief"" of The
B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. Denise Richards looks amazing in a white leather
catsuit (her catfight scene with ""Sistah Girl"" is worth the price of
the DVD all by itself), and oddly enough, even though I usually find
Eddie Griffin and Chris Kattan (who plays The Man's flunky, ""Mr.
Feather"") quite irritating in other films, their shtick totally works
in ""Undercover Brother."" Fast, funny, and an utterly silly good time,
""Undercover Brother"" is -- in the words of its hero -- ""Solid.""

In the 80s there was a film called ""i'm gonna get you sucka"" about a
black gang led by keenan ivory wayans who bring down a white company
run by Mr. Big played by john vernon. It was hilarious and ""undercover
brother"" is the same type of movie and equally funny. Whitey has
mind-controlled a black general modeled on colin powell, and turned him
away from running for president. Instead they have him shill for a
fried chicken restaurant that has mind control drugs in their
chicken.!! Whitey wants to turn blacks into slaves and the BROTHERHOOD
led by our hero UB, is out to stop them. Among the choice bits of
silliness is when smart brother develops a vaccine against the drugs
but says they can't use it cause it only works on one person at a
time!!! Now how can a vaccine only work on one person at a time?

Many films in the history of the cinema 
have been difficult to identify, and this 
one embodies some of the typical 
exasperations of critiquing film. Definitely 
a hit or miss film, you either have to 
know about the blaxploitation movement

I have both attributes, I give this movie 
a 6/10. Some of the moments were 
genuinely funny and entertaining, but

this film (I work at a theater, and get to 
see this stuff for free). Eddie Griffin was 
surrounded by a rather solid supporting 
cast which seemed to parody all of the 
common elements of a typical blaxploitation 
film. But then again, is this film really 
anti-white propaganda or some silly 
parody? It's hard to tell, which means 
the decision is certainly up to the viewer.

Uneven but entertaining comedy which puts an effective comic spin on
popular blaxploitation films. Griffina stylish, super cool secret
agent who always gets his manis recruited by an ambitious black
brotherhood to investigate the ambiguous actions of a prominent black
general who's given up his love of politics for fried chicken. In
addition, Griffin also matches wits with an evil, megalomaniacal white
man. An undeniably goofy setup is made worthwhile by a lot of hip,
amusing dialogue and clever, innovative sight gags. Suffers from
occasional lapsesas most films of this genre dobut the cast is
clearly having fun and make it worth the viewing experience. **½

There's seems to be a lot of misplaced animosity among, what I presume,
are ""white"" commentators, regarding this film's racial thrust.<br><br>The film isn't about belittling or ridiculing ""white people.""<br><br>The film is about tackling prejudices: And specifically those among the
U.S.'s so-called ""white"" and ""black"" populations, but told from,
ostensibly, a ""black"" perspective, and told with humor.<br><br>Reading the negative comments on this film I wonder what movie some of
the angry folks were watching. Racism is using one's own physical
traits to establish social superiority over another person, or group of
people, who don't look like themselves. I saw nothing of any of the
African/Black/persons-of-color trying to ""reverse role play"" by holding
themselves in a superior light over so-called ""white people.""<br><br>It simply wasn't there.<br><br>Myself, I hate ""white guilt"" messages in media of all forms. I've had
enough social agenda thrust in my face. But that's NOT THE MESSAGE of
""Undercover Brother.""<br><br>What a lot of the ""angry-white-commentators"" are bothered by is the
fact that they believe this film makes ALL so-called ""white persons""
look like evil-clowns, or condescending jerks. IT DOESN'T. If that's
what you see in this film, then maybe you shouldn't be watching movies
in the first place.<br><br>This film, as stated clear as day by both cast and crew, is an attempt
to tackle a social problem with good humor. If you're offended by the
jokes in this film, then you've completely missed the point, and are,
in fact, the racist idiot that you claim this film to be (I believe
psychologist call this phenomenon ""projection,"" where someone refuses
to acknowledge their own faults, and casts their own negative qualities
on people they dislike).<br><br>But to the movie; it was hilarious. Myself, not being black, I couldn't
help but laugh of the number of stereotypes this film poked fun at;
especially ""Conspiracy Brother"" (played by Dave Chappell), whose loose
form of illogic-thinking and one-liners had me, quite literally,
falling out of my chair with laughter. And Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie
Howser M.D. fame) playing the ""affirmative action"" intern nearly bust
my gut, particularly near the end of the film. And Chris Kattan as the
evil high energy second in command was just brilliant. The entire cast
and film was superb. Think ""Shaft"" meets ""Get Smart"" here. :-)<br><br>What this film needed was to poke more fun at itself in a more direct
manner. In a large sense this film pokes fun at itself in terms of its
genre, but I think it also needed to show a couple more stereotypes.
One of the great ""high-profile"" stereotypes in white America are black
people talking in theaters, or otherwise being loud and obnoxious in
places and circumstances ""white"" Americans thinks inappropriate. It
would've been nice to see Undercover Brother cleaning up ""his peoples""
stereotypes, but doing so with humor before going after ""the man."" <br><br>I think that's a thing the film makers missed, because the other thing
I believe ""angry white commentators"" are bothered by is the fact that
there are ""black"" folks who have their own prejudices, and that this
film might seen by that segment of black-America as a green light for
ridiculing ""whites."" IT ISN'T.<br><br>One of the other themes the film makers missed is the coupling that
that occurs between Denise Richard's character and Eddie Griffin's
character. One of the primary drives of racism is the abhorrence of
interracial couples. This plot point, even though it's high comedy,
seemed implausible for a racially motivated antagonist. Then again,
that may've been part of the film makers' strategy to show how
ludicrous racial prejudice is, and can be.<br><br>The final mistake, and this is more of a minor quibble, but a profound
one from a fan of this film, was the downplay of Jim Kelley's role in
this film.<br><br>Where I grew up Jim Kelley was a hero, and this was amongst a circle of
friends who were all white. I think the marketing decision to ace Jim
Kelley's role in this film was a mistake. Not a huge one, but a mistake
nonetheless.<br><br>If you're still of the opinion that this film is racist (assuming
you've read this far and haven't burst a blood vessel), then I would
suggest you're taking the film too personally, because the film isn't
ridiculing so-called ""white-people,"" but prejudice that, in this case,
is assumed by a large chunk of white America. If you think otherwise,
then you're not viewing this film with a clear mind.<br><br>Beyond that, it's one of the funniest films I've ever seen. View it
with a relaxed and open mind, and enjoy some of the biggest laughs to
ever hit the big screen.

An Afro-American organization, the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., is in
permanent fight against a white organization, The Man, defending the
values of the black people in North America. When the Afro-American
candidate Gen. Warren Boutwell (Billy Dee Williams) has a weird
behavior in his presidential campaign, the Undercover Brother (Eddie
Griffin) is hired to work undercover in the white organization and find
what happened with the potential candidate.<br><br>I do not recall the last time I laughed so much with a comedy.
""Undercover Brother"" is one of the most hilarious and silly comedies I
have ever seen, and very underrated in IMDb. The story is a big joke
with the North American racism, both white and black, with very funny
situations ""à la Austin Powers"". I believe this is the major point of
the plot, keeping a neutral position and ridiculing and satirizing
racism of Caucasians and Blacks. Dave Chappelle is the funniest, but
Chris Kattan, Eddie Griffin, Aunjanue Ellis, Denise Richards and the
rest of the cast are also amazingly funny. I did not understand the
joke with mayonnaise, but I believe that usually Afro-American people
do not like this dressing, or at least there is a clichés about in USA.
There are many other jokes related to the North American culture that
are impossible to be understood by an overseas viewer, but anyway I
loved this movie. My vote is eight.<br><br>Title (Brazil): ""Undercover Brother  Com a Cor e a Coragem""

I loved ""Undercover Brother!""  It's the movie ""Pootie Tang"" should have
been!  I found it over-the-top, laugh-out-loud funny!  Eddie Griffin scores
as Undercover Brother, an afrolicious version of Austin Powers.  And Chris
Kattan is hilarious as Mr. Feather, an evil underling of The Man, devoted to
the white man's dominance, but succumbing to hip-hop influence.  Other funny
performances came from Dave Chappelle as the paranoid Conspiracy Brother,
and Neil Patrick Harris as the clueless caucasian intern Lance.  Some
viewers may complain about the black stereotypes, but you must look at it as
black actors and filmmakers laughing at themselves.  It's all a ""solid""

Undercover Brother is a smart and sassy comedy similar to Austin Powers.
Eddie Griffin stars as Undercover Brother a smooth seceret agent type cat
who is out to save the world from the Man. He gets help from the brother
hood who have employess with names like Conspiracy Brother &amp; Smart Brother
and Sistah Girl. The supporting cast of Chi McBride, Chris Kattan and
Denise
Richards are all very good but Dave Chapple steals every scene he's in.
Malcom D.Lee has made a worthy follow up to The Best Man and Unisversal may
have a new franchise on their hands.

If you find 'Family Guy', 'Married ... with Children' or even 'The
Simpsons' to be in bad taste, you may want to avoid this movie. If you
found 'Good Times' and 'What's Happening!' to be stereotypical and
buffoonish, you probably won't like this movie.<br><br>If you are still reading ...<br><br>According to this movie, African Americans have made numerous advances
as a result of the Civil Rights movement. But a powerful Caucasian male
known as 'The Man', whose face we never see, wants to put black people
back in their place.<br><br>Which is why the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. must stop him.<br><br>If there was such a person as 'The Man', he could have written this
movie.<br><br>Eddie Griffin did quite a good job in what were essentially two roles.
Most of the time, he had the giant afro and the cool clothes and the
classic Cadillac pumping out funky 70s music as he represented
everything good (or bad, depending on your view) about the
'blaxploitiation' genre. And he worked undercover as Anton Jackson
wearing a suit and acting more white than I do. A very good contrast,
showing a lot of acting skill.<br><br>Billy Dee Williams nailed the potential presidential candidate
obviously based on Colin Powell, who was acting very strange for some
reason. Not quite stereotypical, because he was always dignified--but
shouldn't have been. His advertising campaign was hilarious!<br><br>Denise Richards and Aunjanue Ellis also gave good performances as the
two female partners of Undercover Brother--one when he was black, and
one when he was undercover.<br><br>Chi McBride and Gary Anthony Williams were very funny as two of
Undercover Brother's associates. And Dave Chappelle was very
stereotypical, very racist, but very funny--it was just satire, after
all. Neil Patrick Harris did quite a good job as the organization's
token white. And let's not forget the one associate of 'The Man' who
seemed to want to be black and even acted black at times. That must
have been Chris Kattan.<br><br>With all these talented actors, there were of course very clever
writers to make the material so hilarious. It takes real talent to
produce satire as opposed to just being mean-spirited.<br><br>The music was good too, for this type of movie. I personally would like
to have heard Jay-Z do Lawrence Welk. Or maybe not. Today's artists
don't often sound as good as, say, Rod Stewart. I'm not hopeless,
though. I can't stand Michael Bolton or Celine Dion or, even though he
wasn't mentioned but could have been, Kenny G. For some reason I do
like 'Jungle Boogie' by Kool and the Gang.<br><br>I highly recommend this movie for fans of satire.

These days, we're all used to the weekly deluge of movies adapted from
novels, comics and other mediums, but 'Undercover Brother'  released
in 2003 - was one of the first movies to be adapted from an internet
source. The film is based on a series of internet-based short animated
episodes, also called 'Undercover Brother'. The adaptation is
successful (with some scenes lifted directly from the animated shorts),
focusing on racial stereotypes while paying homage to spy movies and
seventies blaxploitation films.<br><br>Eddie Griffin is brilliant as the confident, swaggering, yet
good-hearted title character, who is called into the
B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D organisation to stop The Man after he kidnapped
presidential hopeful General Warren Boutwell (Billy Dee Williams) and
brainwashed him to sell fried chicken, with an aim to wipe out the
black community.<br><br>One of the strengths of this movie is the cast. Aside from the
aforementioned Griffin and Williams, there's Dave Chappelle as
Conspiracy Brother, in a role not dissimilar to his stand-up routine
(in this case a good thing), Gary Anthony Williams (who provided many
of the voices in the original internet series) as Smart Brother,
Aujanue Ellis as the headstrong Sistah Girl, the backbone of the group,
Neil Patrick Harris (before his breakout roles in the 'Harold and
Kumar' movies and 'How I Met Your Mother') as the
B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D's white intern Lance, Chris Kattan as Mr.
Feather, the underling to The Man who is secretly enchanted by black
culture, Denise Richards as White She-Devil, described as 'the black
man's kryptonite', and a cameo from James Brown, the Godfather of Soul.<br><br>While there is a lot of silly humour in this film (like the 'Austin
Powers' trilogy) and broad racial stereotypes  black people like fried
chicken and hate mayonnaise  the black director Malcolm D. Lee, and
the predominantly black cast ensures the black characters are never
mocked for a cheap laugh.<br><br>The soundtrack is a highlight, with a lot of songs from the
blaxploitation era, some Michael Jackson and more modern urban music.
Even if you're not a fan of this genre of music, it's still fairly
catchy.<br><br>Though it's very much a comedy (at times very silly but never stupid),
the film has a lot to say about how ridiculous racial stereotypes are.
The role of Boutwell as the possible first black president is relevant
to modern viewers (even though the film's only six years old) with the
presidency of Barack Obama only a few months old.<br><br>Overall, 'Undercover Brother' is a hilarious, silly film, which pays
homage to the spy and blaxploitation genre and explores racial
stereotypes without ridiculing them for cheap laughs.

I first saw ""Undercover Brother"" on cable a few years ago and since
then it's become one of my favorite comedies of recent years. Though
it's basically a ""blaxploited"" version of the ""Austin Powers"" concept,
""Undercover Brother"" is funny enough to be enjoyable on its own merits.<br><br>As the film opens, we are filled in on the ongoing battle between the
black community and a super secret organization known as ""The Man,"" who
works tirelessly to negate African-American influence on the world at
large. Fortunately, the black community has its own underground group,
known as ""The B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D."" created to undermine The Man's
plans to ""Whitewash"" the world.<br><br>Eddie Griffin stars as Undercover Brother, a funky '70s throwback hero
with a huge Afro and platform shoes, who drives around in a pimped-out
Caddy performing acts of Kung-Fu derring-do to aid the African American
cause. Normally a lone wolf, he is drafted into the
B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. when a black war hero (Billy Dee Williams)'s
plans to run for President are derailed by a mind control drug designed
by The Man. Now rather than run for the White House, he runs a
nationwide Fried Chicken chain instead. Ably assisted by fellow
B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. agents Sistah Girl, Conspiracy Brother, Smart
Brother, and ""Lance"" (Neil Patrick Harris in a hilarious turn as the
lone white member of the group -- he got his internship through -- what
else? -- affirmative action), Undercover Brother infiltrates The Man's
organization to destroy the plot, though he nearly becomes a victim of
their most potent weapon, the gorgeous Denise Richards, aka ""White
She-Devil"" (whom ""The Man"" calls ""Black Man's Kryptonite."") along the
way.<br><br>I have seen a lot of discussion on IMDb about this film being ""racist""
towards whites, but to be honest, I found ""Undercover Brother"" to be an
equal opportunity offender, with no stereotype about blacks OR whites
going un-skewered. The cast is excellent, especially Dave Chapelle as
the eternally paranoid agent ""Conspiracy Brother,"" and the always
welcome Chi McBride as the long-suffering ""Chief"" of The
B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. Denise Richards looks amazing in a white leather
catsuit (her catfight scene with ""Sistah Girl"" is worth the price of
the DVD all by itself), and oddly enough, even though I usually find
Eddie Griffin and Chris Kattan (who plays The Man's flunky, ""Mr.
Feather"") quite irritating in other films, their shtick totally works
in ""Undercover Brother."" Fast, funny, and an utterly silly good time,
""Undercover Brother"" is -- in the words of its hero -- ""Solid.""

In the 80s there was a film called ""i'm gonna get you sucka"" about a
black gang led by keenan ivory wayans who bring down a white company
run by Mr. Big played by john vernon. It was hilarious and ""undercover
brother"" is the same type of movie and equally funny. Whitey has
mind-controlled a black general modeled on colin powell, and turned him
away from running for president. Instead they have him shill for a
fried chicken restaurant that has mind control drugs in their
chicken.!! Whitey wants to turn blacks into slaves and the BROTHERHOOD
led by our hero UB, is out to stop them. Among the choice bits of
silliness is when smart brother develops a vaccine against the drugs
but says they can't use it cause it only works on one person at a
time!!! Now how can a vaccine only work on one person at a time?

Many films in the history of the cinema 
have been difficult to identify, and this 
one embodies some of the typical 
exasperations of critiquing film. Definitely 
a hit or miss film, you either have to 
know about the blaxploitation movement 
of have a very low sense of humor. Since 
I have both attributes, I give this movie 
a 6/10. Some of the moments were 
genuinely funny and entertaining, but 
overall, I probably wouldn't pay to see 
this film (I work at a theater, and get to

cast which seemed to parody all of the

Modest and unassuming in nature, Jacobi\'s firm place in theatre history centers around his fearless display of his characters\' more unappealing aspects, their great flaws, eccentricities and, more often than not, their primal torment.Jacobi was born in Leytonstone, London, England, the only child of Alfred George Jacobi, a department store manager, and Daisy Gertrude (Masters) Jacobi, a secretary. His paternal great-grandfather was German (from Hoxter, Germany). His interest in drama began while quite young. He made his debut at age six in the local library drama group production of ""The Prince and the Swineherd"" in which he appeared as both the title characters. In his teens he attended Leyton County High School and eventually joined the school\'s drama club (""The Players of Leyton"").Derek portrayed Hamlet at the English National Youth Theatre prior to receiving his high school diploma, and earned a scholarship to the University of Cambridge, where he initially studied history before focusing completely on the stage. A standout role as Edward II at Cambridge led to an invite by the Birmingham Repertory in 1960 following college graduation. He made an immediate impression wherein his Henry VIII (both in 1960) just happened to catch the interest of Olivier himself, who took him the talented actor under his wing. Derek became one of the eight founding members of Olivier\'s National Theatre Company and gradually rose in stature with performances in ""The Royal Hunt of the Sun,"" ""Othello"" (as Cassio) and in ""Hay Fever"", among others. He also made appearances at the Chichester Festival and the Old Vic.It was Olivier who provided Derek his film debut, recreating his stage role of Cassio in Olivier\'s acclaimed cinematic version of Othello (1965). Olivier subsequently cast Derek in his own filmed presentation of Chekhov\'s Three Sisters (1970). On TV Derek was in celebrated company playing Don John in Much Ado About Nothing (1967) alongside Maggie Smith and then-husband Robert Stephens; Derek had played the role earlier at the Chichester Festival in 1965. After eight eventful years at the National Theatre, which included such sterling roles as Touchstone in ""As You Like It"", Jacobi left the company in 1971 in order to attract other mediums. He continued his dominance on stage as Ivanov, Richard III, Pericles and Orestes (in ""Electra""), but his huge breakthrough would occur on TV. Coming into his own with quality support work in Man of Straw (1972), The Strauss Family (1972) and especially the series The Pallisers (1974) in which he played the ineffectual Lord Fawn, Derek\'s magnificence was presented front and center in the epic BBC series I, Claudius (1976). His stammering, weak-minded Emperor Claudius was considered a work of genius and won, among other honors, the BAFTA award.Although he was accomplished in The Day of the Jackal (1973) and The Odessa File (1974), films would place a distant third throughout his career. Stage and TV, however, would continue to illustrate his classical icon status. Derek took his Hamlet on a successful world tour throughout England, Egypt, Sweden, Australia, Japan and China; in some of the afore-mentioned countries he was the first actor to perform the role in English. TV audiences relished his performances as King Richard the Second (1978) and, of course Hamlet, Prince of Denmark (1980).After making his Broadway bow in ""The Suicide"" in 1980, Derek suffered from an alarming two-year spell of stage fright. He returned, however, and toured as part of the Royal Shakespeare Company (1982-1985) with award-winning results. During this period he collected Broadway\'s Tony Award for his Benedick in ""Much Ado about Nothing""; earned the coveted Olivier, Drama League and Helen Hayes awards for his Cyrano de Bergerac; and earned equal acclaim for his Prospero in ""The Tempest"" and Peer Gynt. In 1986, he finally made his West End debut in ""Breaking the Code"" for which he won another Helen Hayes trophy; the play was then brought to Broadway.For the rest of the 80s and 90s, he laid stage claim to such historical figures as Lord Byron, Edmund Kean and Thomas Becket. On TV he found resounding success (and an Emmy nomination) as Adolf Hitler in Inside the Third Reich (1982), and finally took home the coveted Emmy opposite Anthony Hopkins in the WWII drama The Tenth Man (1988). He won a second Emmy in an unlikely fashion by spoofing his classical prowess on an episode of ""Frasier"" (his first guest performance on American TV), in which he played the unsubtle and resoundingly bad Shakespearean actor Jackson Hedley.Kenneth Branagh was greatly influenced by mentor Jacobi and their own association would include Branagh\'s films Henry V (1989), Dead Again (1991), and Hamlet (1996), the latter playing Claudius to Branagh\'s Great Dane. Derek also directed Branagh in the actor\'s Renaissance Theatre Company\'s production of ""Hamlet"". In the 1990s Derek returned to the Chichester Festival, this time as artistic director, and made a fine showing in the title role of Uncle Vanya (1996).More heralded work of late include profound portrayals of the anguished titular painter in Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon (1998), the role of Gracchus in the popular, Oscar-winning film Gladiator (2000), and sterling performances in such films as Two Men Went to War (2002), Bye Bye Blackbird (2005), The Riddle (2007), Endgame (2009), The King\'s Speech (2010), Jail Caesar (2012), and as the King in Cinderella (2015). Continuing to mesmerize on the stage, he has turned in superb performances in ""Uncle Vanya"" (2000), Friedrich Schiller\'s ""Don Carlos"" (2005), _A Voyage \'Round My Father (2006), ""Twelfth Night"" (2009) and the title role in ""King Lear"" (2010). On the British TV series front, he has commanded more recent attention in the title role of a crusading monk in the mystery series Cadfael (1994), as Lord Pirrie in Titanic: Blood and Steel (2012), as Alan in Last Tango in Halifax (2012), and as Stuart Bixby in Vicious (2013).He and his life-time companion of three decades, Richard Clifford, filed as domestic partners in England in 2006.

Along with Mark Gatiss, he is one of only two actors to play both the ""Doctor Who"" character the Doctor and his greatest enemy, the Master. He played the former (as well as a failed television writer named Martin Bannister) in the Big Finish ""Doctor Who Unbound"" audio drama Deadline. He played the latter in both the BBCi webcast Doctor Who: Scream of the Shalka (2003) and the Doctor Who (2005) episode ""Utopia"".      He has portrayed two different versions of the ""Doctor Who"" character the Master: an android copy of the first incarnation of the Master in the BBCi webcast Doctor Who: Scream of the Shalka (2003) and the fifth incarnation of the Master in the Doctor Who (2005) episode ""Utopia"".      Played ""Hamlet"" opposite Timothy West and, later, John Turner as ""Claudius"" in the Prospect Theatre Company productions. He would later direct Kenneth Branagh in the title role, before appearing as ""Claudius"" in the film production directed by Branagh.      After Roger Delgado, Peter Pratt, Geoffrey Beevers, Anthony Ainley, Gordon Tipple and Eric Roberts, he is the seventh actor to play the Master, the Doctor\'s greatest enemy. He played the role in Doctor Who: Utopia (2007). He was succeeded in the role by John Simm and Michelle Gomez.      Nominated for the 1988 Tony Award (New York City) for Actor in a Drama for ""Breaking the Code"".

He also appears in The King\'s Speech (2010), though not as the character who stutters.      He played the Roman Emperor Claudius between the ages of 18 (in 9 AD) and 63 (in 54 AD) in I, Claudius (1976).      An only child.      Derek is a fan of Doctor Who (1963) and wanted to be cast in the series since the beginning. He has also wanted to be cast in Coronation Street (1960).      He claims to have been close to being cast as Hannibal Lector in The Silence of the Lambs (1991). The same is true of Daniel Day-Lewis.      He was considered for the roles of Dr. Armstrong and Dr. Bukovsky in Lifeforce (1985). Patrick Stewart and Michael Gothard were eventually cast.      As of 2014, has appeared in three films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: Gladiator (2000), Gosford Park (2001) and The King\'s Speech (2010). Of those, The King\'s Speech (2010) and Gladiator (2000) are winners in the category.      He has appeared in five films directed by Kenneth Branagh: Henry V (1989), Dead Again (1991), Hamlet (1996), Cinderella (2015) and Murder on the Orient Express (2017).      He has two roles in common with Charles Laughton: (1) Laughton played the Roman Emperor Claudius in I, Claudius (1937) while Jacobi played him in I, Claudius (1976) and (2) Laughton played Gracchus in Spartacus (1960) while Jacobi played him in Gladiator (2000).      Although he played Claire Bloom\'s son in Hamlet, Prince of Denmark (1980), he is only seven years her junior in real life. Furthermore, he played Patrick Stewart\'s nephew and stepson in the same production but is almost two years his senior.      Although he played Hanna Schygulla\'s son in Dead Again (1991), he is five years her senior in real life.      He has appeared in six films with his domestic partner Richard Clifford: Little Dorrit (1987), Henry V (1989), The Fool (1990), A Bunch of Amateurs (2008), My Week with Marilyn (2011) and Jail Caesar (2012).      He has two roles in common with his Breaking the Code (1996) co-star Richard Johnson: (1) Johnson played King Claudius of Denmark in ITV Saturday Night Theatre: Hamlet (1970) while Jacobi played him in Hamlet (1996) and (2) Johnson played the Roman Emperor Claudius in Churchill\'s People: The Lost Island (1975) while Jacobi played him in I, Claudius (1976).      He was awarded the CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 1985 Queen\'s Birthday Honours List and became a Knight Bachelor in the 1994 Queen\'s New Year Honours List for his services to drama.      He was awarded the 1989 Drama-Logue Award for Performance for the play, ""Byron-Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know,"" in the American Premiere in the Centre Theatre Group/Ahmanson Theatre production at the James A.

He played Archibald Craven in two adaptations of the 1911 novel ""The Secret Garden"" by Frances Hodgson Burnett: The Secret Garden (1987) and ABC Weekend Specials: The Secret Garden (1994).Personal Quotes (4)      I\'ve now been there, done that, and got the T-shirt. We just went to the registry office, signed a bit of paper and it was all over. We didn\'t have a bit party, but we had twenty-five friends to lunch. It was very quiet though, all over in a morning. - On his civil partnership ceremony      It\'s as though you have crossed Niagara on a tightrope 250 times and, on the 251st crossing---vertigo. You are convinced you can\'t move across the stage without falling over. You go rigid from the knees down. You suddenly wonder, why am I doing this? I knew I\'d got to get through a whole season, three spanking parts, and that if I ran away, I would never act on stage again. It was that knowledge that shocked me out of my illness. But I had a very bad time in the first weeks. - DJ, regarding his two-year spell of stage fright and subsequent return in 1982 to the Royal Shakespeare Company      Acting is painting, not photography, but painting is just as \'real\' as photography. As an actor conscious that you are in a theatre, you still have to make it look as spontaneous as if you did not know that you are being watched by 1,000 pairs of eyes.      I\'ve been acting for 33 years. I\'ve proved I can do it. So any performance now has got to be deeper and better than that, nothing to do with ego, bravura, look-at-me acting. That is an invitation to the audience to assess your ability, and it gets in the way. The object is to get past that and lose yourself in your belief in the person you are trying to create. To find something absolutely real. But I constantly hope to go further than I manage to do.

He was celebrated for his virtuosity and for the depth and intensity of his characterizations. He could dance en pointe, a rare skill among male dancers at the time and was admired for his seemingly gravity-defying leaps.Nijinsky was introduced to dance by his parents, who were senior dancers with the travelling Setov opera company, and his early childhood was spent touring with the company. His older brother Stanislav Fomitch and younger sister Bronislava Nijinska also became dancers. At age nine Nijinsky was accepted at the Imperial Ballet School (later known as the Maryinsky School) in St. Petersburg, the pre-eminent ballet school in the world. In 1907 he graduated and became a member of the Imperial Ballet, starting at the rank of coryphée instead of in the corps de ballet, already taking starring roles. His sister Bronia also became a dancer and choreographer, working closely with him for much of his career.In 1909 he joined the Ballets Russes, a new ballet company started by Sergei Diaghilev. The impresario took Russian ballets in Paris, where high-quality productions such as those of the Imperial Ballet were not known. Nijinsky became the company\'s star male dancer, causing an enormous stir amongst audiences whenever he performed. In ordinary life he appeared unremarkable and was withdrawn in conversation. Diaghilev and Nijinsky became lovers; the Ballets Russes gave Nijinsky the chance to expand his art and experiment with dance and choreography; he created new directions for male dancers while becoming internationally famous.In 1912 Nijinsky began choreographing original ballets, including L\'après-midi d\'un faune (1912) to music by Claude Debussy, Jeux (1913), and Till Eulenspiegel (1916). At the premier of Le Sacre du Printemps (1913) in Paris, with music by Igor Stravinsky, fights broke out in the audience between those who loved and hated this startling new style of ballet and music. Faune caused controversy because of its sexually suggestive final scene. Nijinsky originally conceived Jeux as a flirtatious interaction among three males, although Diaghilev insisted it be danced by one male and two females.In 1913 Nijinsky married Hungarian Romola de Pulszky while on tour with the company in South America. She had \'stalked\' the company and Nijinsky since 1912. The marriage caused a break with Diaghilev, who soon dismissed Nijinsky from the company. The couple had two daughters together, Kyra and Tamara Nijinska.With no alternative employer available, Nijinsky tried to form his own company, but this was not a success. He was interned in Budapest, Hungary during World War I, under house arrest until 1916. He was finally permitted to leave after intervention by Diaghilev and international leaders; he was allowed to go to New York for an American tour. Calls for his release had been made by Alfonso XIII of Spain and President Wilson at the urging of Otto Kahn.Nijinsky became increasingly mentally unstable with the stresses of having to manage tours himself and deprived of opportunities to dance, which had always been his total obsession. After a tour of South America in 1917, and due to travel difficulties imposed by the war, the family settled in St. Moritz, Switzerland. His mental condition deteriorated; he was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1919 and committed to an asylum for the first time. For the next 30 years, he was in and out of institutions, never dancing again in public.""']","['Romola de Pulsky', '""Wife of Vaslov Nijinksy.""']","['Sergei Diaghilev', '""""']","['Little Kyra', '""""']","[[<bound method Tag.get_text of <p>

or analysis in favor of love and feeling, and repeats over and

how he just wants to love everyone, so how can there be war, or
any

and music, often taken from Nijinsky's choreographies, into a
tapestry
that brings real meaning from what could be called the written
ravings
of a madman.  Recurring characters based on roles Nijinsky made
famous
illustrate the feelings and episodes expressed in the diaries.
The
result is an expression of the meaning behind the madness that I
found
thought-provoking (even if Nijinsky would not approve of all
that
thinking!).<br><br>The camera work makes an intriguing parallel to the diary itself;
the
execution of the diary is naive in a way reminiscent of folk art,

the ideas in it are deeply sensual.  Cox is certainly as capable
of
slick camera work as any good director, but for the dance scenes in
the
woods (especially those from ""Afternoon of a Faun""), he chose a
style
of camera work that looks just a little bit clumsy and
amateurish,
while filming a choreography so sensual that it caused quite a

She received her first roles mainly because of her stunning beauty, but over time she has become a fine actress respected by fans and critics alike. Bisset has worked with directors John Huston, François Truffaut, George Cukor and Roman Polanski. Her co-stars have included Anthony Quinn, Paul Newman, Nick Nolte, Kenneth Branagh and Marcello Mastroianni.Her somewhat French-sounding name has led many to assume that she is from France, but she was brought up in England and had to study to learn French. Her mother was French and was an attorney before being married. As a child Jacqueline studied ballet. During her teenage years her father left the family when her mother was diagnosed with disseminating sclerosis; Jacqueline worked as a model to support her ailing mother and eventually her parents divorced, an experience she has said she considered character-strengthening. She took an early interest in film, and her modeling career helped pay for acting lessons.In 1967 Bisset gained her first critical attention in Two for the Road (1967), and in that same year appeared briefly in the popular James Bond spoof Casino Royale (1967), playing Miss Goodthighs. In 1968 her career got a boost when Mia Farrow unexpectedly dropped out of the shooting of The Detective (1968); Farrow\'s marriage to co-star Frank Sinatra was on the rocks, and her role was eventually given to Bisset, who received special billing in the film\'s credits. That same year she earned a Golden Globe nomination as Most Promising Newcomer for her role in The Sweet Ride (1968), and gained even more attention playing opposite Steve McQueen in the popular action film Bullitt (1968). In 1970 she co-starred in the disaster film Airport (1970) as a stewardess carrying Dean Martin\'s love child, and the film was one of the biggest box office hits of the year. Then she had the starring role in The Grasshopper (1970), and co-starred with Alan Alda in the well-reviewed but commercially underperforming horror film The Mephisto Waltz (1971). In 1973 she became recognized in Europe as a serious dramatic actress when she played the lead in Truffaut\'s La nuit américaine (1973). However, it would be several years before her talents would be taken seriously in the US.Jacqueline\'s stunning looks and figure made quite a splash in The Deep (1977). Her underwater swimming scenes in that movie inspired the worldwide wet T-shirt craze, and Newsweek magazine declared her ""the most beautiful film actress of all time"". The film\'s producer, Peter Guber, said ""That T-shirt made me a rich man."" However, she hated the wet T-shirt scenes because she felt exploited. At the time of filming she was not told that the filmmakers would shoot the scenes in such a provocative way, and she felt tricked. Next up came high-profile roles in The Greek Tycoon (1978), a thinly disguised fictionalization of the marriage of Jacqueline Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis, and Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe? (1978), for which she received a Golden Globe nomination as Best Actress in a Comedy.In the early 1980s, Bisset starred in the box office disasters When Time Ran Out... (1980) and Inchon (1981), but her well-received turn opposite Candice Bergen in Rich and Famous (1981) in between those two films gained her recognition as a serious actress from American audiences. She rebounded neatly with Class (1983), playing Rob Lowe\'s attractive mother who has an affair with her son\'s prep school roommate, and as Albert Finney\'s wife in Under the Volcano (1984), a part that earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She also earned praise for her work in the cable adaptation of Anna Karenina (1985) with Christopher Reeve, and in the miniseries Napoleon and Josephine: A Love Story (1987) with Armand Assante. In 1989 she co-starred in the racy comedy Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills (1989) and the controversial erotic thriller Wild Orchid (1989), neither of which did well at the box office, but her output remained consistent with television projects and independent features.In 1996, she was nominated for a César Award, the French equivalent of the Oscar, for her performance in La cérémonie (1995). She had roles in historical period dramas such as Dangerous Beauty (1998), as a retired courtesan in 16th-century Venice, and the Biblical epics Jesus (1999) and In the Beginning (2000), playing the Virgin Mary and Sarah, wife of Abraham, respectively. Other notable credits included the miniseries Joan of Arc (1999) alongside Leelee Sobieski, which gained her an Emmy nomination, and The Sleepy Time Gal (2001), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival but unfortunately was not picked up for theatrical distribution. In 2005 Jacqueline was back on the big screen playing Keira Knightley\'s mother in the Domino Harvey biopic Domino (2005) for Tony Scott, and in 2006 she had a meaty recurring role in the fourth season of the FX series Nip/Tuck (2003) as the ruthless extortionist ""James."" More recently she appeared in BBC\'s program Dancing on the Edge (2013), for which she finally won her first Golden Globe Award, and in the movies Welcome to New York (2014) with Gérard Depardieu and Miss You Already (2015) with Drew Barrymore and Toni Collette.Bisset has never married, but has been involved in long-term romantic relationships with Canadian actor Michael Sarrazin, Moroccan entrepreneur Victor Drai, Russian ballet dancer Alexander Godunov, French actor Vincent Perez and Turkish martial arts instructor Emin Boztepe. She continues to make numerous films, and frequently participates in film festivals and award ceremonies around the world.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Roger Burns <rogerburns@att.net>          Trade Mark (4)        Natural brunette hair        Sparkling green eyes        Voluptuous figure        Deep sultry voiceTrivia (19)      Her first job was a waitress in a Chinese restaurant.

I\'m fascinated by a man with a twinkle in his eye.      [1980] I\'m either offered window-dressing parts in large movies or little art films no one ever sees. People think the movies I end up doing are my real choices. I do the best things I\'m offered.      After filming The Deep (1977), all they talked about was my boobs for the next four years. God, if I was going to do a picture like that, I\'d have done it a lot sexier. That looked like two fried eggs on a platter.      The picture is called Class (1983) but the ad campaign is anything but. They\'ve put my head onto another body and given me enormous bosoms. All the guys are going to be disappointed.      [on her childhood home] Not one newspaper that came into the house ever left it. There were masses of books everywhere and furniture enough for three homes. My brother and I were extremely upset by it - and have now turned into clean freaks.      I grew up in a small town, so it was thrilling to come to London in the 1960s. Everyone was experimenting and having fun. We would go to Soho and meet all those incredible image changers: Roman Polanski, David Bailey, The Beatles, Ursula Andress and Terence Stamp, who is still a close friend.      I look at photos of myself and think, ""God, if I had realized I was so cute, I would have been naughtier!"". But you could put any woman in a wet T-shirt and men would lust after her.      I have never had any cosmetic surgery. I\'ve never worried about age. I don\'t think all the nips and tucks look good. If these women who\'ve had work done looked sideways in the mirror, they would see that they get a stiff curtain across their face. I think they do it because they are terrified of not being loved and of other people\'s opinions. Things on my body are not up as much as they used to be, and that\'s a bore. So I just smile more, which helps. I am becoming a fuller person as I get older.      [on boyfriend Emin Boztepe] Our age gap is not a big issue. It just depends on what you have in common and, although Emin is much younger, he\'s a very mature man. There are things that are different about someone who is not of the same generation as you: they don\'t know everything you know; they look at things differently, but things can work out just fine.      [on Steve McQueen] It was exciting working with him. But he was a hip American and I was very English. His phrases would drive me nuts. I didn\'t know what a dude was or a soul chick. I did find him attractive, but a little bit scary. He\'d get on his bike and take off like a wild alley cat; that was his escape from fame.      [on Nick Nolte] Nick is a very sexy man. He is not very aware of that himself, though, he doesn\'t act ""sexy"" -- he\'s just Nick. That is an extremely intriguing kind of sexy.      [on Albert Finney] Albert is a little bombastic, but he has a twinkle in the eye. He treats me like an ex-wife.      I have an intense obsession with making films. I not only love to make films, I perhaps need to make films.      I love being in my garden. I don\'t plant a lot of exotic flora, but I do spend a lot of time outside doing manual labor.      I\'d like to get my public image nearer to my reality. People have a lot of misconceptions.      My view is quite simple. When your dog pees on the carpet, you do not give away your dog. You say, This dog is special. I have to teach him not to pee on the carpet. I feel exactly the same way about men. They need to be taught things.      Ideally, couples need three lives; one for him, one for her, and one for them together.      Marriage has just never interested me.      The thing about anything in life is you have to get ready for it. Study, learn.      To be used in a part without depth is a frustrating feeling, when you know you have something to give.      When I am working on a movie, all I want to talk about is the movie. All I want to be with are the movie people. It\'s like a clan. If I\'m asked to people\'s houses for dinner, I hate to go, because they\'ll talk about other things.      You could have a fantasy, but it\'s got to be based on something you are able to do. I think a lot of people\'s unhappiness comes with their lack of reality.      [on goddaughter Angelina Jolie, 2015] Unfortunately, I haven\'t really developed a close relationship with Angelina. I see her rarely. [...] So many people are pulling her time. I\'m a little bit shy, actually, to be truthful, and I don\'t want to be someone who tries to take advantage of her.      [2008] I think the world\'s gone nuts. I\'m not very proud of the way things are. I don\'t feel very proud of America, the way things are, just the complete lack of discipline. I think it makes America look really cheap, the mixture of all these young women just showing everything and behaving like wild things. I mean, we\'re all wild when we\'re young, you know, but there\'s some degree, it\'s just a matter of degree. I just feel like all these kids just have no parents, there\'s no one looking after them, and I think that\'s really, really said, that no one is willing to be disciplinary for young people so they have something to emulate. I really feel horrified by it. I feel really sorry for these girls, too, and I wonder if they have anybody they can trust, to talk to and put an arm around them, you know, someone genuine who is not self-interested. I presume it will pass, this time, because if it goes on...it\'s hard to imagine. Society goes through times when things are out of control, more than less.      If you keep your dignity deep within yourself and you know why you did something -- anything -- then you\'ll carry your dignity with you. If You sell yourself for the wrong reasons with the attitude, ""Oh, I\'ll go through with this, take the money and run,"" it will catch up with you. Ultimately, there will be a shallowness and a taking from life rather than giving.Salary (4)La nuit américaine\xa0(1973)      FRF200,000 + 20% royalty on the profits      The Deep\xa0(1977)      $200,000       Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?\xa0(1978)      $500,000       Inchon\xa0(1981)      $1,650,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nMartha Plimpton ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 29 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(20)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(5)  Overview (3)Date of Birth16\xa0November1970,\xa0New York City, New York, USA Birth NameMartha Campbell PlimptonHeight5\'\xa05""\xa0(1.65\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          She has show biz in her blood. Martha Plimpton was born November 16, 1970, in New York City to two actors: Keith Carradine and Shelley Plimpton. Martha began her career at age 8, when her mom had a friend of hers, composer Elizabeth Swados, enroll her in an actors\' workshop. At age 10, she got a small part in Rollover (1981), and also made a series of Calvin Klein commercials.Her first substantial film role was as a tomboy in The River Rat (1984); the following year, Steven Spielberg cast her in The Goonies (1985). Martha met River Phoenix while they were both filming The Mosquito Coast (1986), but since she was only 15 at the time, she did not go out with him. Even though she had a small part in the movie, it established her as a serious actress. Martha appeared in movies such as the screwball comedy Stars and Bars (1988) and, that same year, she was paired again with Phoenix in Running on Empty (1988). They dated for a while and then broke up. For a while, she was engaged to actor Jon Patrick Walker.As if making movies didn\'t keep her busy enough, Martha frequently worked at theaters and made her Chicago debut with the Steppenwolf Theatre Company Ensemble in ""The Libertine"" in 1996. As a member of that ensemble, she received a National Medal of Arts award in the autumn of 1998. As for movies, Colin Fitz (1997) and Eye of God (1997) in which she plays the starring role, have been run at the Sundance Film Festival. Although some recent movies have had low box office (Pecker (1998) $2.1 million, and 200 Cigarettes (1999) $6.8 million), Martha\'s performances shine and she often rises above her material.Perhaps recalling how important acting lessons were to her as a child, she donates her time and efforts to the ""52nd Street Project"" which is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to matching the inner-city children with professional theater artists to create original theater, by writing, directing and performing their own plays. Perhaps one of the inner-city kids she is coaching will be the next famous actress in Hollywood.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       kdhaisch@aol.com          Trivia (20)      Daughter of actors Keith Carradine and Shelley Plimpton; granddaughter of actor John Carradine.

It chooses you. You have very little control over that. So I stopped considering that an option.      On River Phoenix: Once when we were fifteen, River and I went out for this fancy dinner in Manhattan and I ordered soft-shell crabs. He left the restaurant and walked around on Park Avenue, crying. I went out and said, ""I love you so much. Why?"". He had such a pain that I was eating an animal, that he hadn\'t impressed on me what was right. I loved him for that. For his dramatic desire that we share every belief, that I be with him all the way. (Cosmopolitan magazine, April 1995)      Don\'t go to Hollywood right away unless you\'re, like, ridiculously hot and only marginally talented. In which case, go straight to Hollywood and make all the money you can. Just take the money and run!      I like to try new things. I like to go new places and I like to work with new people. That\'s sort of the definition of my job. As an actor, you just go where the work is, right?      The \'80s to me, more than anything else, represents a real time of criminal activity in the office of the president: an incredibly disparate economy in terms of the class distinctions and whatnot, and a tremendous shallowness - a lot of sort of bank robbery by executives. This is the \'80s to me. and a lot of synthesizer music. And, of course, Madonna and the beginning of MTV.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nNick Stahl ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 35 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(15)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(15)  Overview (3)Date of Birth5\xa0December1979,\xa0Harlingen, Texas, USA Birth NameNicolas Kent StahlHeight5\'\xa010""\xa0(1.78\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Nick Stahl was born in Harlingen, Texas on December 5, 1979, to Donna Lynn, a brokerage assistant, and William Kent Stahl, a businessman. After his mother took him to see a children\'s play at the age of four, Nick confidently declared that acting would be his future. Commercials and community plays followed, two television movies were also released in the early 90s. The breakthrough he needed came next when he starred alongside Mel Gibson, who hand-selected Nick for the role, in The Man Without a Face (1993). Nick played Chuck, the little boy who befriends a stranger that was disfigured in an accident. At age 17 he was cast in Disturbing Behavior (1998) and the ensemble film The Thin Red Line (1998), which was nominated for Best Picture by the Academy Awards. He has continued to find success with acting, and though he has been featured in major studio productions he is still, to date, more widely known for his edgier and darker indie film roles.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       bcnu_84@hotmail.com          Spouse (1) Rose Stahl (4 June\xa02009            - present)\xa0(separated)\xa0(1 child)          Trivia (15)      Has two older sisters, Bonny and Emily.

If I had some fake tanner, I\'d like to play \'Ernesto \'Che\' Guevara\' ! I think I kind of look like him except for my skin tone. But seriously, He\'s one of my idols.      I was an escapist, the guy who wanted to get out of school and out of the suburbs...Acting saved me.      For Sin City (2005) the director wanted me to talk in a certain voice for this character. So I left my audition on an answering machine. It worked.      I\'ve always chosen the movies and roles that I do solely by the content. That\'s what I\'ve always tried to do. Something like T3 was so unexpected for me, and was not something I can honestly say that I expected to be doing, given the films I\'d been in before. I think that the scale of a movie and the budget a lot of times determines the quality. Sometimes you find that there is better material in small and more independent movies. There\'s more risk-taking. I want to keep doing that for the future and choose projects based on the content and the role, and how good those are. And I think the budget of movie to me is somewhat secondary. - On his career choices.      [on being asked if he would like to appear in Terminator Salvation (2009)] I don\'t care really, to be honest. I don\'t have much interest.      (On his initial reaction to living in Los Angeles) It\'s a place built on this industry, and that\'s hard to get used to. Whenever your career is not on your mind, then there is always something there to remind you of it. Early on, it was very competitive in that way, and I am not an extremely competitive person. I had to find ways to enjoy it. I had to do my own thing and not get caught up in that kind of rat race.      (On ""Carnivale"" (2003) getting canceled) It ended because there weren\'t enough people watching it. It\'s pretty simple and comes down to not enough people watching versus the amount of money they spend on each episode. I would say more people come up to me about that than anything else. It was on a premium channel, which narrowed the field of viewers off the bat. It never had the numbers that they wanted. But the fans that it had were very hard-core and loyal fans that loved it. It kept us going for two seasons.      I\'ve been lucky to get to do good films. That\'s all I\'ve ever asked for. Acting is the only thing I\'ve ever done. A studio film would be great to do. I\'m not opposed to any genre or budget. A lot of times the smaller films happen to be the better ones - that\'s just the way it is. But I\'m not opposed to doing bigger films, as long as they\'re not god-awful.      (On Brad Renfro\'s death and working with him on Bully (2001)) There was a lot of recreational drinking and things like that going on during the shoot. For someone like me, who has been through drugs and drinking, it was pretty easy to spot that Brad had problems.      (On being a child actor) I had sort of a dual life in a way - I was going away and doing films, and then coming back, and hanging out with friends, and getting into trouble, and experimenting with drugs, and doing all that stuff, and so my teenage years had some darker times to them, that aren\'t the fondest memories for me.      (On playing ""Yellow Bastard"" in Sin City (2005)) Well, first of all, just to give you kind of the back story on getting that role, it was not a role I was supposed to do. I was just supposed to be in the beginning of the film, when it\'s me without the make-up, before he later turned into [the Yellow Bastard]. And they had another actor who was set to do the Yellow Bastard role - and he fell out of the movie, he had a conflict or something, so Robert Rodriguez called me to and he just said, ""Hey man, maybe you could do both, and maybe we can see that it\'s you, kind of, through the makeup, and maybe it\'ll be even better"". And I thought it was cool because, it\'s a bigger role obviously, and I got to do more on the film. But I was intimidated by doing this theatrical cartoonish thing. It\'s obviously drawn a certain way, and you can get kind of a voice of this crazy character through Frank Miller\'s writing, but I was really intimidated because I still didn\'t know completely what Frank had in mind. This character...when he actually speaks, and he moves around, and his physicality, and I was like, ""I don\'t know what to do. I have to - obviously this is really broad, and I have to make this into something big, and something scary"". But really I was kind of in the dark about it. I was just hoping that what I did synched up with what they wanted. They didn\'t fire me, so I guess it was okay. But I don\'t ever want to wear that many prosthetics again in my life! It was miserable. Not only grueling time-wise to put it on - but, you know, just sitting there in it. It\'s stiflingly hot, you can\'t move. You feel like you\'re stuck together. Luckily we only did that character....I only had makeup on for, I think, five days. It was shot so fast on video, rapid-fire.      (2008 quote on landing parts and the politics of Hollywood) I like auditioning; I\'ve always felt comfortable with doing it. I mean, I\'ve always felt more comfortable in an audition than a meeting. I think it\'s the same reason why I have such nervousness about public speaking and things like that. But as soon as I\'m filming or onstage or something like that, I just never have. I\'m kind of in that world, maybe, in character, and so I can do that, no problem. But having to meet some strangers and talk about myself for an hour, it\'s a lot more difficult for me. So, I\'ve never had a problem with auditioning, and especially if it\'s for something that I really like. You know, all that I have ever been frustrated about, or wanted, was just the opportunity to do it, to audition, and actually have a fair competition. Because...it\'s taken me a long time to come to terms with the politics of this, of the town, you know, and sometimes, it sucks to have to abandon a movie that you\'re really proud of and then go on and have to do something that you don\'t really believe in, because you need money. But I\'ve also been really fortunate that I\'ve never had to have...a job, a real job, in my life. You know, I\'m twenty-eight years old, and that\'s pretty amazing. And that feels good. What gets really hard to deal with sometimes, when it comes to the politics of the town - and by that, I mean if someone has a lot of popularity in the moment, they\'ll just get offered something for that reason. But you know, if that [level of popularity] happens with me. I\'m obviously gonna have a different take on it. But if I\'m not able to even read, to even go in on something...that\'s hard to deal with. Because if I\'m up against someone who\'s genuinely better for the role, that\'s great, I can totally deal with that, that\'s fine. It\'s the lack of opportunity that\'s really hard to deal with sometimes. It\'s just part of the business end of things, which has never been my strength.      (On auditioning for Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)) I went in for the first audition, which led to five or more auditions and two or three screen tests. It was pretty intense - each time it was one or two hours, really hatching it out.      [Interview with Fred Topel, December 2013] I\'m not doing a lot of work right now. I\'m sort of focusing on life stuff and things are going good, so I\'m not really looking a lot into the future at the moment. That\'s sort of what\'s necessary for me, so a lot of what I\'m focusing on really is my daughter, my family and things like that. If that\'s the case, that\'s awesome. I love films and acting. That\'s what I\'ve always done. It\'s really all that I know how to do, so that would be fantastic and I\'d love to do it in the future.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nAmy Madigan ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 16 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(2)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(10)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(2)  Overview (2)Date of Birth11\xa0September1950,\xa0Chicago, Illinois, USA Height5\'\xa05½""\xa0(1.66\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          In the 1960s, Amy attended St. Philip Neri grammar school and Aquinas High School, both in Chicago, where she performed in school plays and was known as the school tomboy.

Forget about Sissy Spacek and Halle Berry.  If ""The Sleepy Time Gal"" had
been released theatrically in 2001 (and the fact that no distributor
picked
it up is a tragic commentary on the state of today's film scene), the
glorious Jacqueline Bisset would have been awarded the Best Actress Oscar
at
last week's dismal ceremony.
Long-acclaimed for her dazzling beauty (""The Deep,"" ""Class,"" etc.), but
sadly overlooked for her impeccable acting abilities (was everyone dozing
when she gave breathtaking performances of subtlety and nuance in ""Under
the
Volcano,"" ""Rich and Famous,"" ""High Season,"" ""Le Ceremonie,"" etc.), Ms.
Bisset's portrayal of a woman trying to put her life in order when she is
told she has terminal cancer is one of the finest performances ever
committed to celluloid.
Independently produced on a low-budget, ""Sleepy Time Gal"" is exactly the
type of superior filmmaking so rare these days, and the fact that it was
sold to the Sundance Channel (where it premiered on March 29, 2002)
instead
of being theatrically distributed to art-houses whose discerning patrons
crave exactly this type of subtle, intelligent, exquisite jewel of a film)
is a tragedy.
Christopher Munch's direction/screenplay  are sublime.  In supporting
roles,
Amy Madigan, Seymour Cassell, Nick Stahl, and Martha Plimpton give
performances of astonishing intelligence and warmth.
As does Jacqueline Bisset, probably the finest and most underrated (as
well
as achingly beautiful) actress of all time.
Ms. Bisset's performance, heartfelt, honest, totally devoid of
histrionics,
is truly to be cherished!  As is ""The Sleepy Time Gal.""

""The Sleep Time Gal"" is a the top of the heap in the little indie bone yard;
that place, just around the corner from cable television and next door to
standard broadcast, where the many failed hopes and dreams of independent
film makers go after they die in the marketplace. A near miss with many good
qualities, the film is a meandering, plaintive reflection by a dying woman
(Bisset) without a story of sufficient consequence to make one want to sit
through it. The film starts well and then unravels, opening issues it can't
close, showing us stuff we couldn't care less about like the mushroom thing,
and generally boring the thumb toward to fast forward button. A misfire with
lost potential and obvious talent behind it, ""TSTG"" should RIP.

Christopher Munch has written and directed only three films, not one of
which ever received commercial distribution.  Obviously, if you want
""commercial"" easy watching, his movies are not for you.  A viewer can have a
tough time finding his movies, but maybe that's OK, because once seen, they
can haunt you for years.  He makes a different sort of film than the easy to
find shoot-em-down-and-blow-em-up product that, once seen, can barely be
recalled a week later.  When I see a film by Christopher Munch, I think (as
I also do after movies by Abel Ferrara or Claire Denis), ""This is what
celluloid is for.""  Look, I love a good car chase as much as the next guy,
but some types of human experience require more than machinery to chase
down.    Munch is a cinematic poet of unfulfilled longing, but unfulfilled
longing is not a subject that lends itself to tidy reconciliations and happy
endings.  ""The Sleepy Time Gal"" is all about the lives we might wish for,
but will not have.  If that sounds sad, it is.  But surprisingly, it's not
bleak the way you might expect, because Munch also shows us characters whose
lives contain riches that they do not see themselves.  Munch's main
character, Frances (played with aching beauty and regret by Jacqueline
Bisset) is a dying woman who, as she tells her doctor, has not finished her
life.  Too bad for her.  She only sees what she has not achieved in her
life.  However, her lovers  and we the viewers in the audience  see that
her beauty and her lust for life have enriched those around her in ways that
she cannot recognize, perhaps because the experiences have not been
comparably enriching for her.  In a sense, she gives what she has not
received.  This sounds more sentimental than it is in the movie.  There is
no sentimentality in this movie.  For one thing, the main character is not
easy to like.  She's a woman with rough edges and few illusions about the
joys of parenting or the permanence of love.  For another, the relationships
among parents and children here are all complicated.  There are no simple
loves, no simple hatreds, and all the connections are difficult.  For just
these reasons, the relationships are completely believable.  The movie has
what might be the most realistic deathbed scene I've ever seen in a film. 
The film was shot by Rob Sweeney, who also shot Munch's previous film, ""The
Color of a Brisk and Leaping Day,"" one of the most beautifully photographed
films I've seen in the last decade.  This movie too contains frame after
frame of richly textured compositions that never devolve into prettiness. 
Munch is not a linear storyteller.  The complicated relationships in the
movie unfold indirectly through scenes that seem initially unrelated.  The
varied visual textures in the cinematography help differentiate the
different times and places in which we see the characters.  I've only seen
Nick Stahl in a few things, but the more I see of him, the more I'm
impressed with his versatility.  He's the manipulative Bully in Larry
Clark's film of that title, and the naive, doomed every-boy of ""In the
Bedroom.""  Here he plays Bisset's son, and he's just as believable as a
sensitive guy finding the strength to make his own way in the world without
abandoning his assertive (and not entirely loving) mother.  Altogether, this
movie maps the rocky shoals of ambiguous family relationships as well as any
I've seen.  If you want ""entertainment,"" skip this.  If you want ""easy""
watching, skip this. If you want tidy emotional resolutions, skip this.  But
if you're up for a visually gorgeous, subtly acted reflection of the skips
and stumbles that comprise most of our emotional lives, check this
out.

This is another example of a film that will stay with you. <br><br>I am not going to go into a lengthy review here; why? 
A couple of other reviewers did so very well with their comments.  Let me
say simply that I found the film to be an interesting 'study' of
relationships. 
I call it a study because is is a film that asks the viewer to listen
carefully, and to think.  I echo another reviewer in saying that the death
scene is very realistic. (So many films make it so sparkling, they almost
make death appealing).  It was part of what made this film so good; I was
amazed at how saddened and disturbed I became in watching Frances' last
days. <br><br>

The first thing that crossed my mind when I had watched this movie for
a few minutes was how predictable some things were.Oh,I thought.Here we
have an aspiring indie flick,let's see how much I can guess from the
story.It was more than I had hoped for unfortunately. Not that the
acting is bad,it is not,but the story,the lines,the characters are
unfortunately full of clichés.The lines often feels unnatural and
far-fetched,people in real life won't talk to one another as if they
were acting in an on-stage play.I'm sorry,they don't.<br><br>The free-spirited and deeply intellectual former radio host Frances has
three children with three different men.Every man she meets is of
course attracted to her and fascinated by her,and she has mother
issues(the mother is now senile but still mean and lives in a nursing
home.Anna,Frances's mother, looks much younger than she should,if we
assume that the story takes place around 2000).Frances too looks far
younger than around 70 as she should be as it's stated in the movie
that she's born in 1930. Her two sons are both intellectuals/artists
too,even if constantly broke.The daughter she had with her married
lover Bob was of course given up for adoption and is now,as Frances is
dying from cancer,looking for her.Her name is Rebecca and she is a
highly paid lawyer in New York. God forbid she would be an unnoticed

dies?<br><br>Sleepy time gal has it's qualities.It's almost hypnotic to watch,the

The Sleepy Time Gal was an excellent concept that unfortunately ended up
being unsatisfying.  Death is a hard thing to film but this movie does
nothing to enhance views we have seen about death.  The adoption story
was
wonderful but never met a good end.  I needed to see more resolution
because
I had to assume to much about what Rebecca found out in the end.  I was
disappointed that they never met and that Morgan never eluded to knowing
about her, if he did.  I wish it had been a better movie.  For only being
an
hour and a half long, I felt that it was much longer.  Nice try but the
bar
was never met.

This movie is made up of random scenes with random characters. Very
little linkage is made between the scenes or characters. So a lot of
what is presented is absurd, meaningless or boring. I guess if one saw
it over and over, and if one had an overactive imagination, one could
create for oneself a story line. Of course, that would be your story
line, not the writer's or director's, because they didn't have a story
line or any conception of what this movie is or is supposed to say. No
scene or character is developed enough so that one could care about
them. Even the music is cut short. The best part of the movie was the
credits at the end, where they did play the ""Sleepy Time Gal"" theme
song to completion. The acting was bad and contrived. But, to the
actors' credit, without a plot or story line or anything to go on, what
could they do? To the movie's credit, some of the random scenes have
beautiful photography. I notice a lot of movies these days have a lot
of confusing, random scenes that jump around in time. I suppose someone
asked ""why should a movie be linear?"", and now film makers are making
non-linear films. But it takes more skill than this move maker has (or
most (all?) of the rest) to pull it off. I guess a big ego director is
saying? ""This is my art, take it or leave it!"" Well, I'll leave it.

I got lost in the last half of Sleepy Time Gal. It seemed to fall
apart. Bisset is excellent but the script and the director do not give
her the opportunity to bring the jumbled pieces of this film together
at the end. All of the actors were good but seemed to be in different
films. I don't know what the film is supposed to mean. It seemed a
cheat not to be shown or told what the daughter played by Martha
Plimpton thinks of not finding Bisset's character before she died. We
are shown the daughter getting an address for Bisset, but we are not
shown what she does from then on in her search. Did she stop? Did she
track Bisset only to find that she had died shortly before? If
Plimpton's character had not appeared again in the film, this lack of
information about her would not be so irritating. But she does appear
again in the film and we are never told how she progressed in her
search. In the extras on the DVD, there's an alternate reading of
Bisset's speech to the daughter she gave up. She very clearly states
that she is writing a letter that will be forwarded to the daughter by
the agency. Why was this bit left out of the finished film? Why just
have Bisset talking to the camera as if she's thinking out loud or
dreaming? The film is disjointed. Ultimately, it was an unsatisfying
experience to watch it.

I can't help thinking that this film thought it was a much better film
than it actually was. I just couldn't connect with it. It came off as
pretentious. I also couldn't help but notice a heavy stylistic
influence from Woody Allen of all people here (editing and music style,
but done clumsily) which didn't fit at all. Also, what was with the
Spanish guitar music? This whole film just seemed incoherent. The
acting didn't work - little really worked right in this film. Maybe I
missed the point because I was too asleep to follow it. I found it even
difficult to enjoy the San Francisco scenery. This movie was just work
to watch.<br><br>=by the way, what's so beautiful about Jacqueline Bisset? Anyone else

I cannot imagine a film worse than The Sleepy Time Gal: the acting, the
dialog, the color, the flashbacks, the mumbling, the plot, the
easy-to-miss
ending, and that reclining nude guy waiting to be photographed or
whatever.
And I am late in returning this two-day rental; therefore, I have to pay
for
this garbage twice.  **SPOILERS**  The adopted daughter does not look as
though she is successful  -- her actions, her dress and her vocabulary do
not match the expertise she spouts.  Bob -- why does he receive special
attention in the opening credits?  Do we know him from someplace? -- looks
as though he has never read a book, yet he waxes poetic at times.  Yes, I
realize that I am relying too much on looks, but I mean the whole deal --
the film has to convey some image in the time it has on the screen in
front
of our painful eyes.  Frances, who does not care too much for her own
mother, comes across as the least likely candidate for Mother of the Year.
What's with those sons, especially that black net/lace, sleeveless shirt
worn by Joe Box Camera?  And why does the daughter immediately sleep with
the ole, grizzled dude who, I think, did the same with Mom years back.  Is
the mushroom girl real?  I have no desire to see the additional material
which may explain the 'shrooms or anything else in this dreadful
production/Sundance choice.  I neded the rewind feature of home-viewing to
make certain I got the ending.  The newspaper account of the book critique
is too quick, the writer looks different (I recall her typing earlier),
and
I wonder whether the theatre goers have the advantage of a large screen.
Why, o, why does Bob's wife let Frances become part of hers?  How does
that
come about?  This film makes no sense.

What's with those sons, especially that black net/lace, sleeveless shirt
worn by Joe Box Camera?  And why does the daughter immediately sleep with
the ole, grizzled dude who, I think, did the same with Mom years back.  Is
the mushroom girl real?  I have no desire to see the additional material
which may explain the 'shrooms or anything else in this dreadful
production/Sundance choice.  I neded the rewind feature of home-viewing to
make certain I got the ending.  The newspaper account of the book critique
is too quick, the writer looks different (I recall her typing earlier),
and
I wonder whether the theatre goers have the advantage of a large screen.
Why, o, why does Bob's wife let Frances become part of hers?  How does
that
come about?  This film makes no sense.

She made her cinema debut in Don\'t Bother to Knock (1952) in 1952 and over the next five years appeared in a lot of undistinguished movies as a supporting actress, such as Gorilla at Large (1954), New York Confidential (1955) and The Girl in Black Stockings (1957). By 1957 she had grown dissatisfied with the roles she was getting, left the film industry and spent the next five years doing plays on Broadway. She returned to the screen in 1962 with her portrayal of Annie Sullivan in The Miracle Worker (1962), for which she won an Oscar. Bancroft went on to give acclaimed performances in The Pumpkin Eater (1964), The Slender Thread (1965), Young Winston (1972), The Prisoner of Second Avenue (1975), The Elephant Man (1980), To Be or Not to Be (1983), 84 Charing Cross Road (1987) and other movies as lead actress, but her most famous role would be as Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate (1967). Her status as the predatory ""older woman"" in the film is iconic, although in real life she was just 36 and only six years older than co-star Dustin Hoffman. Bancroft would later express her frustration over the fact that the film overshadowed her other work. Selective for much of her intermittent career, she appeared on the screen more frequently in the \'90s, playing a range of characters in such films as Love Potion No. 9 (1992), Point of No Return (1993), Home for the Holidays (1995), G.I. Jane (1997), Great Expectations (1998) and Up at the Villa (2000). She also started to make some TV films, including Deep in My Heart (1999) for which she won an Emmy. Sadly, on June 6, 2005, Bancroft passed away at the age of 73 from uterine cancer. Her death surprised many, as she had not revealed any information of her illness to the public. Among her survivors was her husband of 41 years, Mel Brooks, and her only child, Max Brooks, who was born in 1972. Her final film, the animated feature Delgo (2008), was released posthumously in 2008 and dedicated to her memory.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Volker Boehm          Spouse (2) Mel Brooks (5 August\xa01964            - 6 June\xa02005)\xa0(her death)\xa0(1 child)                         Martin May          (1 July\xa01953            - 13 February\xa01957)\xa0(divorced)          Trade Mark (2)        In most of her films, she habitually removes an earring before answering a telephone        Husky resonant voiceTrivia (58)      Was a leading choice to play Aurora Greenway in Terms of Endearment (1983).

She remained very uncomfortable and all her answers were monosyllabic. Wogan still says she was his most difficult guest.      She was less than 6 years older than Dustin Hoffman, although in The Graduate (1967) her character is supposed to be more than twice his age. She was only 8 years older than Katharine Ross, who played her daughter in the film.

Life is here only to be lived so that we can, through life, earn the right to death, which to me is paradise. Whatever it is that will bring me the reward of paradise, I\'ll do the best I can.      The best way to get most husbands to do something is to suggest that perhaps they\'re too old to do it.      When [Mel Brooks] told his Jewish mother he was marrying an Italian girl, she said: ""Bring her over. I\'ll be in the kitchen - with my head in the oven"".      [of her Mrs. Robinson role in The Graduate (1967)] Film critics said I gave a voice to the fear we all have: that we\'ll reach a point in our lives, look around and realize that all the things we said we\'d do and become will never come to be - and that we\'re ordinary.      [from 1984] The only reason I\'m still not doing ""Daughter of Gorilla at Large"" is because my personal life had become a shambles. Every picture I did was worse than the last one and every man I was in love with was worse than the last one. I was terribly immature. I was going steadily downhill in terms of self-respect and dignity.      [on John Ford] Marvelous but loony, tearing out pages of the script everywhere.      [1962] When I arrived in town, the movie industry was looking for sexpot glamor girls. I didn\'t qualify. Nor was I ever offered a top-flight movie. But there isn\'t any bitterness on my part. I wasn\'t as good an actress then as I am now.      [on being married to Mel Brooks] When he comes home at night and I hear his key in the lock, I say to myself, ""Oh good! The party\'s about to begin"".      I can sit with anybody in a room for an hour, and by the time they leave, automatically I will know the way they talk and the way they move. That\'s my special art.      When I was in radio, I was Anna St. Raymond; when I was in television, I was Anne Marno; and then in movies I was Anne Bancroft -- if I ever go into burlesque, I\'ve got one picked out: Ruby Pepper.      [Driving to Mexico City for a film] When I was in Mexico on location we had this long drive from the bottom of a mountain all the way to Mexico City. I used to get pretty bored on these drives, so I was shouting out the window, \'Hello, you people - Here I am! You lucky people you!\' So then five guys in this car followed us all the way to the hotel! That\'s the only funny thing that happened to me back then, only it wasn\'t in Hollywood - it was Mexico. Nothing funny happens in Hollywood.      [on her days as a contract player at Fox] I was seduced by every script. I thought every picture was the best, and that I was Greta Garbo. It was the ability to accept these terrible lies that kept me going.Salary (4)Tonight We Sing\xa0(1953)      $500 a week      Treasure of the Golden Condor\xa0(1953)      $500 a week      The Kid from Left Field\xa0(1953)      $500 a week      Freddie and Max\xa0(1990)      £250,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nAnthony Hopkins ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 177 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(3)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(7)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(88)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(70)\xa0|Salary\xa0(4)  Overview (4)Date of Birth31\xa0December1937,\xa0Margam, Port Talbot, West Glamorgan, Wales, UK Birth NamePhilip Anthony HopkinsNicknameTony    Height5\'\xa08½""\xa0(1.74\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Anthony Hopkins was born on December 31, 1937, in Margam, Wales, to Muriel Anne (Yeats) and Richard Arthur Hopkins, a baker. His parents were both of half Welsh and half English descent. Influenced by Richard Burton, he decided to study at College of Music and Drama and graduated in 1957. In 1965, he moved to London and joined the National Theatre, invited by Laurence Olivier, who could see the talent in Hopkins. In 1967, he made his first film for television, A Flea in Her Ear (1967).From this moment on, he enjoyed a successful career in cinema and television.

Often works with Richard Attenborough.        Deep smooth voice        Quiet, reserved performances with an occasional and very vocal outburstTrivia (88)      Is proud of his improvisational touches as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs (1991) such as: the unnerving effect on Jodie Foster when he mocked her character\'s West Virginia accent; the distorion of the word ""chianti"" and the vile slurping sound he makes after he describes eating the ""census-taker."" Hopkins also notes that Hannibal never blinked his eyes when he spoke.      10/97: Ranked #57 in Empire (UK) magazine\'s ""The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time"" list.

Piano virtuoso.      Father of Abigail Hopkins      Into the 1991 restoration of Spartacus (1960), scenes were reintroduced which had been cut from the picture\'s 1967 reissue. One such segment has Laurence Olivier, in the role of Marcus Crassus, attempting to seduce the slave Antoninus (played by Tony Curtis). But the original soundtrack for this segment had become lost. And so, Olivier having died in 1989, Anthony Hopkins imitated the voice of Olivier (whom Hopkins had understudied at the Old Vic) for the scene\'s re-created soundtrack. (The surviving Tony Curtis presumably supplied his own voice.)      Born at 9:15am-UT      One of his greatest pleasures in past years on his frequent visits to the USA was to get in a car and drive across the country, enjoying its immensity as well as his own anonymity.      9/99: Was selected by an Entertainment Weekly on-line movie poll as the Best Modern Actor and the Best Villain for his role as Hannibal Lecter.      4/12/00: Became a U.S. citizen, but is allowed to retain his British knighthood and the title of Sir.

For his stage performance in ""Pravda"", he was awarded the 1985 London Critics Circle Theatre Award (Drama Theatre Award) for Best Actor, and the Laurence Olivier Theatre Award in 1986 (1985 season) for Outstanding Achievement.      He chose to play Prof. Van Helsing in Dracula (1992) because he was still riding the success of his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and wanted to pick a role as far removed from Lecter as possible.      His Oscar-winning performance as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs (1991) was ranked #1 on the American Film Institute\'s Villains list in its compilation of the 100 Years of The Greatest Screen Heroes and Villains.

Is related to the poet William Butler Yeats on his mother\'s side of the family.      He included some unusual touches for Hannibal Lecter during his preparation for the role, among which were making Lecter\'s voice similar to the cutting warble of Katharine Hepburn and almost never blinking, a characteristic he picked up from watching tapes of convicted murderer Charles Manson.      Has played a (future) king of England (Richard Lionheart in The Lion in Winter (1968)) and two U.S. Presidents. Interestingly, President Richard Nixon and his brothers were all named after British kings, so it\'s likely that he played Nixon\'s namesake.      A Member of the RADA Council.      Has three roles in common with Brian Cox. Both of them have played Titus Andronicus. Hopkins appeared on stage as King Lear in 1986, the same year that Manhunter (1986), which starred Cox as Hannibal Lecter, was released.

He and Frank Langella both received Best Actor nominations for playing Richard Nixon, in Nixon (1995) and Frost/Nixon (2008), respectively. Though not the first or only pair of actors to receive nominations for the same part, they are only the second male pair where neither of them won the Oscar. Hopkins lost to Nicolas Cage, while Langella lost to Sean Penn. Previously, Jason Robards and Leonardo DiCaprio have both been nominated for playing Howard Hughes. Robards lost his Oscar to Timothy Hutton, while DiCaprio lost his to Jamie Foxx. Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro had both won for their portrayals of ""Vito Corleone"". José Ferrer won an Oscar, and Gérard Depardieu received a nomination for playing ""Cyrano"". John Wayne won the Oscar and Jeff Bridges was nominated for playing ""Rooster Cogburn"".      During filming of Amistad (1997), he astounded the cast and crew by memorizing a seven page speech in one go. Steven Spielberg was so impressed that he insisted on calling him ""Sir Anthony"" throughout the shoot rather than Tony.      He has played Pablo Picasso, while his friend and frequent collaborator, Richard Attenborough, is an avid collector of Picasso\'s artwork.      His early ambition was to be a concert pianist.      His father was a baker.      Turned down the role of George Smiley in A Murder of Quality (1991).      His parents were of half Welsh and half English descent. His paternal grandfather, Richard Arthur Thomas Hopkins, and his maternal grandmother, Sophia Phillips, were Welsh.

He is filming The City of Your Final Destination (2009) in Argentina, during December 2006 - January 2007. [December 2006]      Pledged $1.6 million to help preserve 4,000 acres of Mt. Snowdon, Wales\' highest peak.      As of 2014, has appeared in five films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: The Lion in Winter (1968), The Elephant Man (1980), The Silence of the Lambs (1991) - which won in the category, Howards End (1992) and The Remains of the Day (1993).      He gave life to many historical figures in many movies and miniseries from presidents to writers and military leaders. His gallery of characters includes Alfred Hitchcock, Richard Nixon, John Quincy Adams, Charles Dickens, Adolf Hitler, Yitzhak Rabin, Pablo Picasso, Bruno Richard Hauptmann, David Lloyd George, Frederick Treves, Lieutenant Colonel Frost, Lieutenant William Bligh, Frank P. Doel, C.S. Lewis, Count Galeazzo Ciano, John Harvey Kellogg and Burt Munro.      He has been wanted very much in the James Bond franchise. First, he was in talks to play a villain in Timothy Dalton\'s unmade third film. Then he was the first choice of the villains in both Goldeneye (1995) and Tomorrow Never Dies (1997). Then he was rumored for Albert Finney\'s role in Skyfall (2012).      In 1997 he was named to star in \'The Ripper Diaries\' to be directed by William Friedkin but in the June it was announced that the film had been put on hold.      He has two roles in common with Frank Langella, who is only one day his junior: (1) Langella played Don Diego de la Vega / Zorro in The Mark of Zorro (1974) while Hopkins played him in The Mask of Zorro (1998) and (2) Hopkins played U.S. President Richard Nixon in Nixon (1995) while Langella played him in Frost/Nixon (2008). Both actors also appeared in adaptations of Bram Stoker\'s 1897 novel ""Dracula"": Langella played the title character in Dracula (1979) while Hopkins played his arch-enemy Professor Abraham Van Helsing in Dracula (1992).      He appeared in four films with Gerald Sim: Young Winston (1972), A Bridge Too Far (1977), Chaplin (1992) and Shadowlands (1993). All four films were directed by Sim\'s brother-in-law Richard Attenborough.      Although he played Nicol Williamson\'s uncle in Hamlet (1969), he was fourteen months his junior.      He appeared in five films directed by Richard Attenborough: Young Winston (1972), A Bridge Too Far (1977), Magic (1978), Chaplin (1992) and Shadowlands (1993).      Was offered the lead role in Gandhi (1982) by Richard Attenborough. When Hopkins called his father to tell him, his father responded with: ""Oh, its a comedy then is it!?"".      Graduated from the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardiff.      He appeared in three films with Anne Bancroft: Young Winston (1972), The Elephant Man (1980) and 84 Charing Cross Road (1987).

Starred with Bob Hoskins in the BBC\'s Othello. Anthony Hopkins and Bob Hoskins are two actors separated by one letter.      Has played a doctor twice: The Elephant Man (1980) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991).      In 1964 Hopkins composed a waltz named ""And The Waltz Goes On"", but he kept it in a drawer for many years until his wife contacted Dutch violinist and conductor Andre Rieu in 2010. Rieu arranged the piece and it premiered in Vienna in 2011 in the presence of Anthony Hopkins. Rieu included the waltz in his playlist for his next tour and produced a CD named after the waltz.Personal Quotes (70)      [on Gary Oldman] He is just like I was at his age.      I was lousy in school. Real screwed-up. A moron. I was antisocial and didn\'t bother with the other kids. A really bad student. I didn\'t have any brains. I didn\'t know what I was doing there. That\'s why I became an actor.      [Interviewed on Inside the Actors Studio (1994)] I once asked a Jesuit priest what was the best short prayer he knew. He said, ""Fuck it,\' as in, ""Fuck it; it\'s in God\'s hands.""      The Welsh people have a talent for acting that one does not find in the English. The English lack heart.      [December 1998] To hell with this stupid show business, this ridiculous showbiz, this futile waste of life. I look back and see a desert wasteland. All those years spent in a fake environment. Everything was a fake.      [on becoming a U.S. citizen in 2000] America has been very generous to me, magnanimous really. I thought it would be good to give something back. It was a decision of the heart.      [on his days as an alcoholic, when he was drinking Mexican Spirit tequila] I was really sort of on a prolonged acid trip. I saw things and had peculiar quasi-religious experiences. I thought I was John The Baptist, and I would talk to the sea at Malibu and the sea would talk back to me. It was weird.      [on his most famous character, Dr. Hannibal Lecter] I think he might be a very interesting person to have lunch with, provided that YOU weren\'t the lunch.      One of the people I got to know years ago, which was a great privilege, was Laurence Olivier. He was like a laser - that was his power. And the only actor I\'ve met since who had that same quality of laser-like determination is Russell Crowe. The first day I started working with him, I thought, ""That guy\'s got it."" The best way to describe Russell is, he\'s like a shark circling round. He was argumentative. He argued with the director all the time. I don\'t know Russell that well, but I admire him, and you know, whatever he\'s got to do really. I really like him because he\'s ballsy, he\'s got guts, he\'s macho and all the rest of it. He\'s going through his bad boy period, but he\'s basically a nice guy.      I am able to play monsters well. I understand monsters. I understand madmen.      Being a smoker is like being trapped in a complicated maze. It\'s as if Allen Carr has a plan of the maze. Instantly I was freed from my addiction.      Acting is still enjoyable, but there are no more challenges any more for me. No, none at all. I\'m much more interested in painting and composing music these days. I\'ve become what I always wanted to be, a jobbing actor. I\'m just detached, I do my thing. I work hard at it, but I don\'t invest my life in it. As long as they pay me on time and I get a good script with a good director, I have fun. That\'s all.      [on former US President Bill Clinton] It seems to me that the country rather misses him. He has impressed me. He asked me if I wanted to accompany him on a trip to Brazil, and so off I went. I\'d met the President before in Washington, a very nice guy. So we were at this dinner, talking after his gig, he gave this incredible speech and he said, ""Would you like to come to Brazil with me next week?"". Of course I said, ""Yes"". He\'s pretty exhausting to be with, because he\'s always wanting to play cards or golf.      Heroes, like Bogart (Humphrey Bogart). They deserve high definition.      I think the first British actor who really worked well in cinema was Albert Finney. He was a back-street Marlon Brando. He brought a great wittiness and power to the screen. The best actor we\'ve had.      I\'ve done some good films. The Remains of the Day (1993) was alright. The Silence of the Lambs (1991). Nixon (1995) I enjoyed. One of my favourites was working with Roger Donaldson on The World\'s Fastest Indian (2005). That was fun and seems to be quite popular. It is wonderful to have reached that point where I can do what grabs my attention, when I want to. I\'m glad those days are gone where I was yearning for work. People think I\'ve worked a lot, but I haven\'t. I\'ve had a lot of time off. I\'ve turned down a lot. When you\'re younger you want to get every part to stop other people getting it. Nowadays, I don\'t care - let them do it. I don\'t go through that terrible thing of thinking, ""If I don\'t do it, then who\'s going to get to do it?"" I just mosey my way through and see what happens.      [on Oliver Stone] Oh, Oliver\'s crazy, but I like him. He\'s very rude to people. He insults people - he insults me - but you just have to give it back. He says to me, ""Oh, you\'re getting old."" So you shoot back with, ""Yeah, so are you. You\'re getting bald, too. You\'ve aged, you\'re getting balder. Actually, you look older than me, Oliver. It\'s no good dying your hair like that."" But he\'s good. He\'s a very talented man. He can be a bit exhausting. I did about 18 hours on Alexander (2004). I never saw it. I understand it wasn\'t very good. I did 18 hours one night out in Borehamwood and thought, ""No, that\'s it."" Had a long rest after that.      [on David Lynch] I wrote him a letter not so long ago because I\'d seen The Elephant Man (1980) again. I wrote him a letter to apologise for my bad behaviour on that film. I was terribly behaved and very rebellious. He wanted to do too many takes and I couldn\'t do it. And he was a little remote and I could never understand what he was talking about which made me very irritable. I haven\'t seen him for years but he\'s a smart man, a very daring figure. I like David very much. Brilliant, I think.      My own father was a tough man. He was a pretty red hot guy but he was also cold. He was also slightly disappointed in me because I was not a good kid as a school boy, you know. But I learned from it, I liked that coldness, because it was harsh. And he taught me to be tough. So I know how to be tough. I know how to be strong. I know how to be ruthless. It\'s part of my nature. I wouldn\'t be an actor if I wasn\'t.      It\'s fun to get the Oscar, it was fun to get a knighthood. But you know, you wake up in the morning, the reality\'s still there. You\'re still mortal.      The movie industry is full of crazy people who think that they are God.      How do you play Hannibal Lecter? Well just don\'t move. Scare people by being still.      I\'d been to the dentist, and I was seven years old, to have a tooth taken out. In those days they yanked it out. I was feeling nauseous and I hallucinated. I was in bed and I remember waking up with a knock at the door - a box was put in my bedroom. And it was full of encyclopedias, which my father had got me. I remember looking through those books and finding a knowledge. I learned everything I could.      For many, many years I felt like I didn\'t belong. I was a duffer at school - everything was incomprehensible to me.      I was an only child. My mother married into a family of in-laws. She felt like an outsider; which she was. She was a powerful force in my father\'s life. He was a baker - and she was ambitious for him. She didn\'t want him to be subservient to his father. She woke him up.      [on meeting his third wife, Stella Arroyave, a Colombian-born antiques dealer]: I married a remarkable woman who has changed a lot of my perception about myself and about life. She\'s very positive, very powerful. Every time I get a negative thought, she says, \'Cancel it\'.      Once you accept the fact that there\'s nothing to fear, you drill into the primal oil well. I believe when we do things without fear, we can do anything. As long as you don\'t worry about the consequences.      [Twenty-three years after asking Burton for an autograph, Hopkins was on Broadway in Equus (1977). Burton was taking over the role from Hopkins, who asked to see him backstage: ""He was about to go on stage and he said, \'Why haven\'t we worked together? You come from Taibach\'. That\'s the only time I met him again.      It\'s nice to get a knighthood but in the end it\'s just the same old face in the mirror getting older and older - you have to shave every morning and you look at your face and think: this is it, this is the deal. And there\'s a wonderful harsh reality about that. Time is going by. I better get on with it. I better live.      I became an actor but I still don\'t feel that I\'m a part of this profession. I never have - 50 years I\'ve been doing it.      [on working with Woody Allen on You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (2010): ""I wasn\'t sure how he would be - I\'d heard stories that he was aloof. Woody says \'Okay, you come in through the door - let\'s rehearse it. Okay, that\'s good. Sure. Let\'s shoot it\'. So we shoot it. \'Okay, very good. But improvise\'.""      [on British humour]: It\'s like Jewish humour. I love that.      We live in such a precious, pussyfooting society - everyone takes offence so quickly.      [He did try therapy, briefly, but didn\'t like it]: Well, you know you never actually fess up to everything - you try to cover your ground, cover your tracks - you want to sound interesting. Living here [in Los Angeles] - all men must cry. Well, I don\'t think we\'re wired that way. I think it\'s okay to express emotions and grief, but to make a habit of it, this endless psychobabble in our culture - everyone goes on The Oprah Winfrey Show (1986) and Dr. Phil (2002) - it makes me want to throw up. I mean, come on!      When I break with a friend it is sudden. I will give no warning ahead of time, just change my address and telephone number. They may be confused - but they\'ll survive. Nobody dies.      I was told years ago that I suffer from \'terminal reasonableness\'. From that point on I thought that was something to work on. Not to become a son of a bitch, but to say no. Now, after all these years, I can say: \'What part of the word \'no\' do you not understand?\'      I don\'t want to be anything else other than what I am. I can say that with passion. No regrets.      There\'s an epitaph on my mother\'s grave - I brought her over years ago and she\'s buried up in the Hollywood Hills - from a poem written in 1896 by Ernest Dowson: \'They are not long, the days of wine and roses: Out of a misty dream / Our path emerges for a while, then closes / Within a dream.\' Isn\'t that beautiful?      [At age 72]: I\'m not getting the parts I was 20 years ago - but I\'m still doing okay. The prospect of that blank wall where there\'s no more work - it doesn\'t fill me with dread.      I sometimes wake at night and I can hear the sea and I think: what the hell am I doing here? How did I get here?"" And I make no excuses. I say \'tough titty.\' Also \'TYFP\' - \'That\'s your f****** problem. \'      From the moment I made that decision [in 1975 to give up drinking] a very powerful thought shot into my brain - it\'s all over, now you can start living. It\'s extraordinary. That\'s what I\'m aware of today. The powerful spirit in me. I\'m not callous. It\'s expediency. I will not be taken for a fool any more.      I may sound to you like a really hard man - I am not ashamed of it at all. I\'m not hard, I\'m honest.      [on paintings he has done] I suppose I could call them primitive because again, as I have no academic training, I could no longer sit in an art class drawing apples or vases or nudes - I can\'t feel hemmed in.      [on acting} I\'m not going to turn my back on it until they tell me it\'s over and we don\'t want you anymore. So if they say they want me I will go ahead and do it, learn my lines. You know, do what I do. So it\'s the best time of my life now.      Beware the tyranny of the weak. They just suck you dry. They\'re always complaining. I go, ""How are you doing?"" They say ""Ahh..."" and they moan and try to take from you. I know a number of people like that, but I can\'t waste my time on them.      Over the years I worked with a couple of younger actors who reminded me of myself. I like bad boys. I worked with Russell Crowe in Australia before he became a star. Russell is a bad boy. I think he is terrific. Richard Burton was a bad boy, but he shook the rafters of the world. I think it is good to be bad - I was bad all my life. I still am.      On Peter O\'Toole: I had some bizarre nights with Peter when we made The Lion in Winter (1968), but to be honest I don\'t remember them. He enjoyed his drink - and I did, too. We weren\'t close friends or anything but we got drunk very quickly and there was always amusement and laughter. I love drunks; they are terrific - except when they throw up on you.      I hated the Sixties. It was one long wet Wednesday afternoon in the Waterloo Road. For most of it I was drinking myself into oblivion.      We like to look into the dark side of ourselves and I think that causes us great fascination and fear. That\'s why people like Hannibal Lecter. He was a man caught in a monstrous mind.      I\'ve got no problem if people want to spend hours beforehand preparing before they come on-set, as long as they don\'t keep you waiting. And I\'ve read Stanislavski and did the Method myself, and all that, but now I\'ve simplified it: learn your lines, show up, and get on with it.      [on Laurence Olivier] He was a pretty colorful personality. He had tremendous drive, and ambition, and was a real force. A very nice guy and a titanic talent. His sort of talent has, in the eyes of cynics, become rather unfashionable. There are people who knock Olivier quite often, but not a single one of them could ever touch him in terms of talent. I thought he was an extraordinary man.      [on playing Hannibal Lecter for the third time in Red Dragon (2002)] I really wanted to play him with much more ferocious energy, and avoid the jokes. I really wanted to show what a true monster he is. He\'s a killer. He\'s a dangerous man, not Mr. Cutesy. This isn\'t a franchise, like Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). This is a dangerous man, who\'s better off in jail. So that\'s the premise we went with.      I\'m not good at being cooped up with anyone for very long. Maybe that\'s why I wasn\'t designed for marriage. I\'m not good at any kind of relationship with people, really. I mean, I\'ve had a number of good ones, but I get restless and I take off.      [on Richard Attenborough] Richard\'s a nice guy, very persuasive, a great salesman in the sense that he gets what he wants from you. He can charm a lot of people. He\'s a good man. I haven\'t seen him for a long time.      You know when some of these megaphones of Hollywood show up on these award shows, and just never shut the f**k up? I just want to say \'Accept your award. Say ""thank you,"" and get off!\' I\'m just not interested in all that bulls**t. There are surgeons and nurses and teachers, people out there who really deserve awards.      [on The Silence of the Lambs (1991)] As soon as I saw that script I knew this was one of those special parts. I don\'t know why, it\'s just an instinct. I\'d never heard of the book. I\'d never heard of Thomas Harris. I read the script and they told me Jonathan Demme was doing it - I\'d never heard of him, either. So I watched Married to the Mob (1988) and Something Wild (1986), which I thought was a terrific film. And we had the great cast: Jodie Foster. I knew it was something good. That was the only surefire one where I knew it was going to work. I remember my first meeting with Jodie in New York, for a reading of the whole script. Jodie had just won the Oscar for The Accused (1988) and I was kind of impressed at this wonderful young actor. I was a little intimidated, a little quiet, shy.....I didn\'t realise she felt the same!      [on Hannibal (2001)] They offered me the part and a very good salary, so I thought, ""Why not?"" First of all I didn\'t think I wanted to do it again, but then they said it was going off to Venice or wherever, so I watched The Silence of the Lambs (1991) briefly and thought, ""Okay, let\'s have another go at this."" I didn\'t care, really. If that\'s what they want, then okay. When Jodie [Foster] dropped out, Ridley [Scott] said to me, ""What do you think of certain actors?"" I said ""I think Julianne Moore is very, very good."" I\'d worked with her on Surviving Picasso (1996). And she pulled it off beautifully. If the film succeeded or not, I don\'t mind. You move on.      I went to America years ago because I felt I didn\'t fit in here [UK]. I worked with some good people here, like Judi Dench and all that. But I never fitted into a group of actors here. I was on the outside; I was like a sore thumb. I didn\'t have any friends who were actors at all - I never did. I\'ve always been on the outside, which is good. But it was difficult being on London in this very strange acting community. All that ""theatre, dahling"" - I just found it insufferable. It was just boring. So I did the thing I\'d wanted to do all my life, which was to make movies. I\'ve never felt a part of this profession, but I enjoy it. Working with Katharine Hepburn on The Lion in Winter (1968), she said to me, ""Don\'t act. Read the lines. Just be."" I said, ""Okay."" She said, ""Watch Spencer Tracy. He didn\'t act. He just spoke the lines."" I thought, ""Well, that\'s pretty good advice."" I think the actors from that generation were wonderful. They didn\'t act. They just came on and they did it, and the characters were wonderful. People say, ""They didn\'t act. They were always themselves."" Well, who else were they going to be? In England we have a tradition where everyone is acting. Too much acting.      We\'re living in a pretty strange time. I went into a shop to buy my wife some clothes. They had this big plasma screen on with these women on the catwalk. I thought, \'God Almighty, what have we become?\' These girls - anorexic, walking like machines, no soul. You look at fashion magazines and you think, \'What are we living in?\' You look at the red carpet, Paris Hilton, and you think, \'Is there anything going on up there?\' It\'s a mass enslavement, it\'s kind of fascism. It\'s the androgyny of the human soul. I don\'t think people think any more. Maybe I\'m just old.      [on Shirley MacLaine] The most obnoxious actress I\'ve ever worked with.      [on how he prepares for the characters he plays] I learn the text!      [on what his idea of a good night is] Staying in and watching Mob Wives on TV. I don\'t have many friends; I\'m very much a loner. As a child I was very isolated and I\'ve never been really close to anyone. Ask nothing, expect nothing. That\'s my creed. We\'re all just a bunch of sinners crashing around in the darkness.      [on what he considers his greatest achievement] Everything rather blends into one now. It was very nice to get an Oscar but now it just rusts and tarnishes on the sideboard near the TV. You can\'t take any of it too seriously. Death comes to us all. Not long ago I was in Arlington cemetery by JFK\'s grave and I thought how the great years of his presidency were just blown away like ashes. Nothing really is of any importance and there\'s a peace in that.      [on why he relocated to the U.S.] Many people talk of London as being the heart of the swinging 60s. It wasn\'t for me. What I remember is the grey mist hanging over the Waterloo Road on a Wednesday afternoon. It was so depressing I moved to the land of Donald Duck.      I\'ve never considered myself a great actor. I\'m a fluke. I work hard and I see through the bastards and to this day I have massive energy; I think it keeps a youthfulness in me. I never slow down because I love to work. I did four films last year. My agent says, \'Would you like to read the phone book next week for them [directors]?\' And I say, \'Yeah OK.\'      I was away for a few weeks in a hotel watching new releases. Some I had to switch off after eight minutes. I couldn\'t understand what anyone was saying.      [on Marlon Brando] He was fascinating to watch, he could do anything. It was the \'screw you\' attitude. That takes tremendous courage or tremendous folly.      My philosophy is: It\'s none of my business what people say of me and think of me.

When she started training at the Central School of Speech and Drama, she admits she wasn\'t taking it as seriously as she ought to have done. She was caught out during an improvisation scene at which point she realised that that was what it was all about and studied harder than she had ever done in her life.      Was not able to attend the Oscars in 2007, because she had to undergo a knee surgery.      Shares two roles with both Kate Winslet and Cate Blanchett.

In a 2004 opinion poll of the Royal Shakespeare Company, Dame Dench\'s performance as ""Lady Macbeth"" in Trevor Nunn\'s 1976 production of ""Macbeth"" was voted the second greatest Shakespearean performance of all time. Only Paul Scofield\'s masterful ""King Lear"" was ranked higher.      In her autobiography ""And Furthermore,"" Dench says that she never really understood what was going on in the movie The Chronicles of Riddick (2004), but she enjoyed the experience of making the movie, and she thought the sets were great.      Has twice been nominated for an Oscar in the same year that another actress was nominated for playing the same role. She received Best Supporting Actress for playing Queen Elizabeth I in Shakespeare in Love (1998), while Cate Blanchett was nominated for Elizabeth (1998).

Counts Mrs Brown (1997) as the movie that became the quintessential breakthrough event of her career as a film actress, winning her her first Oscar nomination.

The only person to always be credited ""and Judi Dench as M"" in all her James Bond opening credits sequences for her appearances. Bernard Lee did not get the credit in Dr. No (1962). Robert Brown never got the credit. Ralph Fiennes was credited as Gareth Mallory in Skyfall (2012).      Following her Oscar win for Shakespeare in Love (1998), the producers of the Bond franchise gave her character M a much larger role -- one central to the film\'s plot -- for the first time in the Bond franchise. While M had typically only been seen in Bond films in bookend scenes at the very beginning and end, this time around the writers made her past actions the primary motive for the film\'s two main villains. They did the same thing with M in Skyfall (2012), purportedly because they were planning to kill off her character and wanted her (platonic) relationship with Bond to come full circle.      Starred in two film adaptations of Anton Chekhov\'s The Cherry Orchard. First in 1962, in the Royal Shakespeare Company production, The Cherry Orchard (1962), in which she played Anya, and in the 1981 BBC production The Cherry Orchard (1981), in which she played the lead, Mme. Ranevsky.      Shares a role with her Nine (2009) co-star Marion Cotillard: both played Lady Macbeth. Dench on stage in the \'70s and Cotillard in the 2015 film adaptation, Macbeth (2015).

Daughter of Reginald Arthur Dench (1897-1964) and Eleanora Olave Dench (née Jones) (1897-1983).      Great aunt of Jacob Bowker.      Aunt of Emma Dench.      Had ""Carpe diem"" tattooed on her right wrist.Personal Quotes (27)      [on her long marriage to Michael Williams] We were just happy to be in the same room together.      My only regret is that I didn\'t have more children.      [in 1994, when asked why A Room with a View (1985) was such a success] I\'ve never seen it, so I don\'t know. Florence was lovely, of course, and it\'s a wonderful love story. I did enjoy doing the part, because Maggie Smith and I were old friends from 1958. We both arrived in Florence on the same day and neither of us had any family with us, so we would spend all day together filming and then go out to dinner together, catching up on our Old Vic days. But I didn\'t enjoy working with James Ivory. I didn\'t feel that I was on his wavelength and I didn\'t feel that he wanted me in the film, I have to say that. I remember doing that scene in the middle of the square where she goes mad and attacks the man selling postcards; James went to see the rushes and told me afterwards that everyone had laughed at it, they\'d thought it was very funny. ""Well done"", he said to me. I thought perhaps we\'d turned the corner but, when I came to post-sync the film, that scene was missing. When I asked why, he told me that Helena Bonham Carter hadn\'t been feeling up to it that day, so he\'d cut the whole sequence. I don\'t know if that was the real reason he cut it - I just don\'t know.      I hate how people have been attacking Daniel Craig. It\'s despicable and it disgusts me. I have filmed with him in Prague and the Bahamas and he is a fine actor. He brings something new and edgy to the role. His critics will be proved wrong.      And then it was working with Bob Hoskins, who I had never worked with before - except radio. It was like being given a wonderful meal - full of the things you love most.      I don\'t like reading scripts very much. I like it better for someone to just explain to me what it is about this story.      I don\'t think anybody can be told how to act. I think you can give advice. But you have to find your own way through it.      The best moment of playing [William Shakespeare\'s] Juliet is the nanosecond when they offer you the part.      On plastic surgery: I\'ve considered it, but I\'m too old now. Every time I go to America I wonder if there is some process where it could all be sucked out and I could be out of there in time for dinner, but I\'m frightened it would all drop off under the anaesthetic.      Of course I have a temper. Who hasn\'t? And the older I get the more angry I get about things. It\'s not sudden anger, it smoulders and then if I really let it go on for a bit the shit hits the fan. I get very angry about general injustice. I get angry about the way people say \'Tomorrow X will make a speech about X\'. Just let them say it. I get furious about the whole business of not allowing conkers in school, and banning things because they are supposedly dangerous. I am riveted by the current Iraq inquiry, though angry already because I feel it will end with a report and nobody\'s actually going to be arraigned for what happened.      [Celebrity culture has led to a ""quick fix"" mentality on the part of younger actors.] They think a big part will change their life, without any back-up. Young actors go into a run and don\'t do all the performances. That would have been unheard of at one time. I know I can sustain a run because of my training.      I mourn that there are so many repertory companies that aren\'t around any more. I don\'t want the arts to take the form of a reality programme. I heard somebody say the other day that it is good if people can bring drink and food into a theatre and get up and go if they don\'t like the play. Well, yes, go out if you don\'t like it, but where do you draw the line? They tell people not to take pictures of us on stage but when you look up you see 100 red lights twinkling at you.      When you go abroad people always talk with such love about British theatre, but the irony is it\'s not appreciated by the Government as it should be. The state of the arts has always been, and will always be, precarious. But there is something so alarming about the huge cuts made to companies, particularly when you read of the astronomical amounts some people are earning.      [Does she feel fulfilled?] No, no, no, no, I hope not. Being fulfilled is closing the drawer again and I don\'t want to do that just yet. I\'d bore myself silly. I wouldn\'t learn anything new. I\'d just sit around and I hate wasting time. I hate waste of any kind. I love quiz programmes. I am riveted by The Weakest Link (2000) but I\'d be too terrified to appear on it.      [Could she find love with anyone else?] It\'s not something that\'s ever happened. I\'ve loved living in the same house, in the same grounds with my family. Sammy (grandson) was 4 when Michael died and he does look extraordinarily like him sometimes.      [Does she miss Michael Williams?] You bet. I don\'t expect you ever get over that. Time changes something, I suppose, but you miss the basic things. Michael was a realist, down to earth, a Lancashire man. I\'m a Yorkshire woman and so that was pretty volatile, I suppose. He was Cancerian, I\'m Sagittarian. He would say: \'I\'m always rushing for the dark, you\'re always rushing for the light. If we hold in the middle, there\'s a kind of balance\'.      Once, a long time ago, I read some bad reviews and I made the decision not to read the reviews. You get some critics who don\'t like you, or the play. But they don\'t have to do it every night. I don\'t want to be affected like that. I loved doing ""Madame de Sade. A friend told me not to apologise for myself or the play, and I won\'t. Then I cast it all off and go and put my feet up under the chimney with my family      [on ageing.] I don\'t like it at all. Suddenly I get up out of a chair and can\'t rush across the room. But there\'s nothing I can do about that, alas. My energy levels are OK, but I can\'t see very well. People have to come up and wave at me. If a restaurant is too dark I can end up talking to the backs of chairs.      The passion doesn\'t lessen over time but you get more anxious. You always worry about getting employed. But I love what I do ... You\'re only as good as the last thing you did. But that anxiety feeds what you\'re doing. It gives you energy. It\'s very much part of me. You know that right behind you, stretching back as far as you can see, are other people wanting to play the same part and probably better than you.      I\'d never met [Sophia Loren] and she arrived on set just as I was about to perform my number. She sat and watched. I said to Rob Marshall: \'I can\'t have ever been more frightened than at this moment.\' It was like someone had given me an enormous injection. I suddenly had to be on the ball.      I am very un-divaish. Very rarely in 52 years in the business have I met anyone who has behaved in a selfish way.      I had no film career until Mrs Brown (1997), which Harvey Weinstein oversaw. He gave a lunch for me at the time and I told him I had his name tattooed on my bum. I hadn\'t, I had my make-up lady design something that I showed him. He\'s never forgotten it.      I\'m more comfortable on stage, where there is an audience to tell a story to, as opposed to a film set where you are not in charge at all. On stage you can hear an audience\'s reactions. Within two minutes of a play starting you know how the evening will go. On film you\'re more reliant on the director. The moment he leaves you, you\'re like a child learning to walk.      National treasure? I hate that. Too dusty, too in a cupboard, too behind glass, too staid. I don\'t want to be thought of as recognisable - I always want to do the most different thing I can think of next. I don\'t want to be known for one thing, or as having done huge amounts of Shakespeare and the classics. I hate speaking as myself. I could never do a one-woman show. But I love being part of a company. On stage I am not trying to be myself, I\'m trying to be someone else, the more unlike me the better. I remember someone who saw me in Juno and the Paycock said I was completely unrecognisable. How marvellous. I\'ve done two sitcoms, lots of films. Look at my character [an obsessive, damaged stalker] in Notes on a Scandal (2006). You wouldn\'t want to ask her around.      I\'m always fearful. Fear in you generates a huge energy. You can use it. When I feel that mounting fear, I think, \'Oh yes, there it is\'. It\'s like petrol.      You should take your job seriously but not yourself. That is the best combination.      Celebrate the things you can do and also try to do new things.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nJean De Baer ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 2 itemsJump to:Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(1)  Mini Bio (1)          Jean De Baer is an actress, known for Maverick (1994), The Man Without a Face (1993) and 84 Charing Cross Road (1987).Trivia (1)      She was nominated for a 1993 Joseph Jefferson Award for Actress in a Supporting Role in a Play for ""The Fourth Wall"", at the Feenix Productions International Ltd. in Chicago, Illinois.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['Helene Hanff', '""""']","['Frank Doel', '""""']","[[<bound method Tag.get_text of <p>

Helene and Frank never actually say they love each other - hell, they never
even meet - but they love each other in an unspoken way that people today
would not understand.  The movie never plays it for sappy romance; its way
better than stooping to that level of convention.  They are good to one
another and enrich one another's life - isn't that love? <br><br>Hopkins has an amazing moment when Helene has to cancel her trip to London
due to some much-needed dental work.  His face shows so many things, all at
once, that it really is beautiful and breaks my heart, no matter how often I
see it. <br><br>For Oscar fans - this movie has four winners - Bancroft, Hopkins, Mercedes
Ruehl and Judi Dench. <br><br>I am grateful that this movie got made with such care and humanity.

84 Charing Cross Road is one of my favorite movies. Based on the
memoirs of Helene Hanff (the book contains the letters from which they
read throughout the film), this is the story of a single New York woman
named Helene Hanff (Anne Bancroft) who builds a forty-year friendship
with some people who work in a bookstore in England. The movie begins
during WWII as Helene, a writer, is searching for out-of-print books
and, frustrated at the poor selection in the city's bookstores, starts
writing letters to the Marx brother's bookstore in England. Through her
letters, she not only becomes a frequent customer, but eventually,
becomes quite close with all of the bookstore's employees. And through
their letters, they share experiences over the years, which the viewer
witnesses through a juxtasposition of two different cultures: American
and British. <br><br>I like the technique used in this film. The interaction between Helene
and her British friends occurs only through letters, so rather than
have the characters write a letter and then dub what is written,
eventually, the characters just face the camera and say what they would
have written, with the camera cutting back and forth for each others
response at times as though we suddenly become the recipient of their
conversations. <br><br>The film also has a wonderful cast with Anne Bancroft as Helene,
Anthony Hopkins as the generous Frank P. Doel, Judi Dench as his wife,
and Mercedes Ruehl as Helene's neighbor. It is a wonderful story.

This movie is an example of how the cinematic medium can powerfully
explore
a mundane activity as letter writing. The movement of the characters
through
their activities and concerns over different times of life and across 2
physically separated cultures is smooth, subtle and engaging. The movie
does
not contain the bombast that many others seem to be more pre-occupied
with.
Rather the viewer is taken into the quiet enjoyment of human conversation
and communication. And just like a good conversation, one is left with
both

I saw this movie in 1987, read the book, and just rented it again in
memory of Anne Bancroft. It remains for me a gem-an amazingly done
story. What is really amazing however-and a sad comment on where
people's attentions are focused-is that in 1987 there were two movies
that dealt with married men and single women. This was one of them; the
other was ""Fatal Attraction."" What a difference! People flocked to see
the latter film in which (spoilers for ""F.A."" here) a single urban
career woman has a brief affair with a married man, tries to kill
herself, tries to kill everyone else, fricassees a pet rabbit, etc. Now
in ""84 Charing Cross Road,"" the heroine's finances prevent her from
crossing the ocean to actually meet the married man of her daydreams-
but even if she had been able to visit England and meet him,I doubt she
would have baked his children's pets or kidnapped his children. This
was not,thankfully,that kind of film. This was a true story of a single
career woman whose life was happy in spite of her being single. She had
friends, her writing, the books she was buying and reading. We see at
one point a photograph on her bureau of a man in uniform-was this a
former boyfriend,a fiancé,who was killed in the war? Possibly-but the
woman does not live in grief nor does she go melodramatically crazy.
It's too bad that America chose to make the derivative trash that is
""F.A."" popular while not honoring ""84 Charing Cross Road"" for its
depiction of a brainy adult relationship.

84 Charing Cross Road is a wonderful enchanting film about the
differences and similarities between the Brits and the New Yorkers over
the years. Helene Hanff really was a special writer. She gave an
identity to 84 Charing Cross Road to last a lifetime. Her letter
writing relationship between a bookstore and herself is one of
legendary stories to become part of London and New York. Sadly, she
died 5 years ago. I am sure that 84 Charing Cross Road will always
remember the writer, Helene Hanff, who inspired such a legacy. Anyway
the film has a wonderful cast like Anne Bancroft who is ageless in the
role. Sir Anthony Hopkins as the bookseller. Dame Judi Dench as his
wife and Maurice Denham in a supporting role. Also, I have been to
London three more times since I wrote this review and sadly this time,
I made the effort to visit 84 Charing Cross Road, sorry folks, it's a
Pizza Hut and I had dinner there tonight anyway. THere is no plaque. I
still think Anne Bancroft was superb now that she's gone. So has
Maurice Denham since I last wrote this review. God Bless them wherever
they are.

I recently saw this film for the first time, as a chance to see an Anne
Bancroft film I had not seen before. Bancroft and Hopkins are both
excellent in this. And, more than almost any other film, they have to
be excellent; their performances are the only thing this little film
hangs on.<br><br>Everything about this film violates almost every ""screenwriting 101""
type rule. The two main characters communicate primarily through
letters. Characters address the audience directly. There is no real
conflict. Change occurs only with the natural passage of time in the
characters' lives. No heroes, no villains. No romance, no violence, no
adventures- just two people (one a writer, the other a rare-book
dealer) living their lives and caring about how the other leads theirs.<br><br>And yet, the film works. Over the span of the 20+ years portrayed in
the film, the audience gets to know and like both of the main
characters, and their compatriots as well. And just getting to know
them and their unique friendship makes it all worthwhile.<br><br>Also, the portrayal of the privations of the post-war U.K. of rations
and food shortages is done very well. Michael Palin, amongst others,
have addressed the tragicomic aspects of postwar rationing in the U.K.,
but in this film, it is poignant how even a poor American managed to
make the entire bookstore's Christmases worthwhile with a well-timed
shipment of Danish food.

'84 Charing Cross', from the address of the used book store in London, takes
place over roughly 20 years from 1949 to 1969. Watching it today, I became
totally immersed in the story, and I found out why later, because it is
based on the real story of Helene and Frank. I always like movies based on
real people, and closely identify with the idea of a seemingly random event
triggering a new and perhaps lasting friendship. Helene (Anne Bancroft), a
New York Jew and struggling writer, loves English literature but cannot find
suitable and reasonably-priced books that she wants in NYC. She finds a
simple ad in a publication, writes to the bookstore in London, they send her
two of the three books she seeks, for a total of $5.30, and the story begins
in earnest from that point. Bancroft (Helene) and Hopkins (Frank) are
magnificent here, in this wonderful little movie of two people, quite
different, living worlds apart, but who become lifelong friends. One of my
new favorites!!<br><br>The rest of my comments contain SPOILERS for my recollection, please stop
reading if you have not seen the movie.  <br><br>The correspondence between Frank and Helene, who became a somewhat
successful TV writer, carried on for 20 years from 1949 to 1969, and was
published in 1970, which eventually led to this movie. During that time he
sent her photos of his family, she sent 'care packages' of food to them in
post-war rationing times, she requested certain books, he found and sent
them. One planned trip to London had to be cancelled because of $2500 of
emergency dental work for Helene. Then, in 1969 she gets a letter that Frank
had died after an attack of appedicitis, and later that the bookstore would
be closed. When she finally was able to make her trip, we see her walk into
a now vacant space, but she smiles as she recalls 20 years of correspondence
with Frank and the other workers there.<br><br>The movie actually begins at the end, as she is on a plane, and awakes to
sunlight through her window as she approaches London. Then, as she enters
the vacant store, the movie flashes back to 1969. When the movie ends, we
see her in the store, the completion of that earlier scene.  No extras on
the DVD, but it has a good picture and sound.

He was of English, Ulster-Scots, and Irish ancestry.Clyde developed a lung condition that required him to move his family from Iowa to the warmer climate of southern California, where they tried ranching in the Mojave Desert. Until the ranch failed, Marion and his younger brother Robert E. Morrison swam in an irrigation ditch and rode a horse to school. When the ranch failed, the family moved to Glendale, California, where Marion delivered medicines for his father, sold newspapers and had an Airedale dog named ""Duke"" (the source of his own nickname). He did well at school both academically and in football. When he narrowly failed admission to Annapolis he went to USC on a football scholarship 1925-7. Tom Mix got him a summer job as a prop man in exchange for football tickets. On the set he became close friends with director John Ford for whom, among others, he began doing bit parts, some billed as John Wayne. His first featured film was Men Without Women (1930). After more than 70 low-budget westerns and adventures, mostly routine, Wayne\'s career was stuck in a rut until Ford cast him in Stagecoach (1939), the movie that made him a star. He appeared in nearly 250 movies, many of epic proportions. From 1942-43 he was in a radio series, ""The Three Sheets to the Wind"", and in 1944 he helped found the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a Conservative political organization, later becoming its President. His conservative political stance was also reflected in The Alamo (1960), which he produced, directed and starred in. His patriotic stand was enshrined in The Green Berets (1968) which he co-directed and starred in. Over the years Wayne was beset with health problems. In September 1964 he had a cancerous left lung removed; in March 1978 there was heart valve replacement surgery; and in January 1979 his stomach was removed. He received the Best Actor nomination for Sands of Iwo Jima (1949) and finally got the Oscar for his role as one-eyed Rooster Cogburn in True Grit (1969). A Congressional Gold Medal was struck in his honor in 1979. He is perhaps best remembered for his parts in Ford\'s cavalry trilogy - Fort Apache (1948), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and Rio Grande (1950).- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Ed Stephan          Spouse (3) Pilar Wayne (1 November\xa01954            - 11 June\xa01979)\xa0(his death)\xa0(3 children)           Esperanza Baur (17 January\xa01946            - 1 November\xa01954)\xa0(divorced)                         Josephine Alicia Saenz          (24 June\xa01933            - 25 December\xa01945)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(4 children)          Trade Mark (5)        Slow talk and distinctive gravelly voice        Distinctive cat-like walk        His movies frequently reflected his conservative values        Often starred with Maureen O\'Hara        Westerns and war moviesTrivia (240)      Holds the record for the actor with the most leading parts - 142.

Most published sources refer to Wayne\'s birth name as Marion Michael Morrison. His birth certificate, however, gives his original name as Marion Robert Morrison. According to Wayne\'s own statements, after the birth of his younger brother in 1911, his parents named the newborn Robert Emmett and changed Wayne\'s name from Marion Robert to Marion Michael. It has also been suggested by several of his biographers that Wayne\'s parents actually changed his birth name from Marion Robert to Marion Mitchell. In ""Duke: The Life and Times of John Wayne"" (1985), Donald Shepherd and Robert F. Slatzer state that when Wayne\'s younger brother was born, ""the Duke\'s middle name was changed from Robert to Mitchell. . . . After he gained celebrity, Duke deliberately confused biographers and others by claiming Michael as his middle name, a claim that had no basis in fact.""      His production company, Batjac, was originally to be called Batjak, after the shipping company owned by Luther Adler\'s character in the film Wake of the Red Witch (1948). A secretary\'s typo while she was drawing up the papers resulted in it being called Batjac, and Wayne, not wanting to hurt her feelings, kept her spelling of it.

An entry in the logbook of director John Ford\'s yacht ""Araner"", during a voyage along the Baja peninsula, made a reference to one of Wayne\'s pranks on Ward Bond: ""Caught the first mate [Wayne] pissing in [Ward] Bond\'s flask this morning - must remember to give him a raise.""      He and his drinking buddy, actor Ward Bond, frequently played practical jokes on each other. In one incident, Bond bet Wayne that they could stand on opposite sides of a newspaper and Wayne wouldn\'t be able to hit him. Bond set a sheet of newspaper down in a doorway, Wayne stood on one end, and Bond slammed the door in his face, shouting ""Try and hit me now!"" Wayne responded by sending his fist through the door, flooring Bond (and winning the bet).      His favorite drink was Sauza Commemorativo Tequila, and he often served it with ice that he had chipped from an iceberg during one of his voyages on his yacht, ""The Wild Goose"".      He was offered the lead in The Dirty Dozen (1967), but went to star in and direct The Green Berets (1968) instead. The part was eventually given to Lee Marvin. He also felt that the film portrayed the military in a bad light.      The evening before a shoot he was trying to get some sleep in a Las Vegas hotel. The suite directly below his was that of Frank Sinatra (never a good friend of Wayne), who was having a party. The noise kept Wayne awake, and each time he made a complaining phone call it quieted temporarily but each time eventually grew louder. Wayne at last appeared at Sinatra\'s door and told Frank to stop the noise. A Sinatra bodyguard of Wayne\'s size approached saying, ""Nobody talks to Mr. Sinatra that way."" Wayne looked at the man, turned as though to leave, then backhanded the bodyguard, who fell to the floor, where Wayne knocked him out by crashing a chair on top of him. The party noise stopped.      He was a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity.      His spoken album ""America: Why I Love Her"" became a surprise best-seller and Grammy nominee when it was released in 1973. Reissued on CD in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, it became a best-seller all over again.      Pictured on one of four 25¢ US commemorative postage stamps issued on Friday, March 23rd, 1990 honoring classic films released in 1939. The stamp featured Wayne as The Ringo Kid in Stagecoach (1939). The other films honored were Beau Geste (1939), The Wizard of Oz (1939), and Gone with the Wind (1939).      Upon being cast by Raoul Walsh in Fox\'s The Big Trail (1930) the studio decided his name had to be changed. Walsh said he was reading a biography on General ""Mad"" Anthony Wayne and suggested that name. The studio liked the last name but not the first and decided on ""John Wayne"" as the final rendition.      He once made a cameo appearance on The Beverly Hillbillies (1962). In episode, The Beverly Hillbillies: The Indians Are Coming (1967). And when asked how he wanted to be paid, his answer, in return, was ""Give me a fifth of bourbon - that\'ll square it."".      In 1973 he was awarded the Gold Medal from the National Football Foundation for his days playing football for Glendale High School and USC.      Arguably Wayne\'s worst film, The Conqueror (1956), in which he played Genghis Kahn, was based on a script that director Dick Powell had every intention of throwing into the wastebasket. According to Powell, when he had to leave his office at RKO for a few minutes during a story conference, he returned to find a very enthused Wayne reading the script, which had been in a pile of possible scripts on Powell\'s desk, and insisting that this was the movie he wanted to make. As Powell himself summed it up, ""Who am I to turn down John Wayne?"".      Among his favorite leisure activities were playing bridge, poker, and chess.      He was buried at Pacific View Cemetery in Corona del Mar, California, (a community within his hometown of Newport Beach). His grave finally received a plaque in 1999.      Inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 1974.      Grandfather of actor Brendan Wayne.      Because his on-screen adventures involved the slaying of a slew of Mexicans, Native Americans and Japanese, he has been called a racist by his critics. They believe this was strengthened by a Playboy Magazine interview in which he suggested that blacks were not yet qualified to hold high public office because ""discrimination prevented them from receiving the kind of education a political career requires"". Yet all of his three wives were of Latin descent.      He was voted the 5th Greatest Movie Star of all time by Entertainment Weekly.      Just on his sheer popularity and his prominent political activism, the Republican party in 1968 supposedly asked him to run for President of the USA, even though he had no previous political experience. He turned them down because he did not believe America would take a movie star running for the President seriously. He did however support Ronald Reagan\'s campaigns for governor of California in 1966 and 1970, as well as his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976.      Wayne was initiated into DeMolay in 1924 at the Glendale Chapter in Glendale California.      Received the DeMolay Legion of Honor in 1970.      He was a Master Mason.      Pictured on a 37¢ USA commemorative stamp in the Legends of Hollywood series, issued on Thursday, September 9th, 2004. The first-day ceremonies were held at Grauman\'s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.      Was a member of the first class to be inducted into the DeMolay Hall of Fame on Monday, November 13th, 1986.      Although he complained that High Noon (1952) was ""un-American"", he was gracious enough to collect Gary Cooper\'s Oscar on his behalf. He was mainly afraid the movie would hurt \'Coop\'s career. He later teamed up with director Howard Hawks to tell the story his way in Rio Bravo (1959).      He had English, Scots-Irish (Northern Irish), and Irish ancestry.      He was voted the 4th Greatest Movie Star of all time by Premiere Magazine.      Was named the #13 greatest actor on The 50 Greatest Screen Legends list by the American Film Institute      He turned down Gregory Peck\'s role in Twelve O\'Clock High (1949).      Posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\'s highest civilian award, by President Jimmy Carter in 1980.      Brother of Robert E. Morrison.      Addressed the Republican National Convention on its opening day in 1968.      On Monday, June 11th, 1979, the flame of the Olympic Torch at the Coliseum in Los Angeles, was lit for honoring him, in memory. It remained lit until the funeral four days later, Friday, June 15th, 1979.Maureen O\'Hara presented him with the People\'s Choice Award for most popular motion picture actor in 1976.      During the filming of The Undefeated (1969), he fell from his horse and fractured three ribs. He couldn\'t work for almost two weeks. Then he tore a ligament in his shoulder and couldn\'t use one arm at all. The director, Andrew V. McLaglen, could only film him from an angle for the rest of the picture. His only concern throughout was not to disappoint his fans, despite being in terrible pain.      According to movie industry columnist James Bacon, Wayne\'s producers issued phony press releases when he was hospitalized for cancer surgery in September 1964, claiming the star was being treated for lung congestion. ""Those bastards who make pictures only think of the box office,"" he told Bacon, as recounted in 1979 by the columnist. ""They figure Duke Wayne with cancer isn\'t a good image. I was too doped up at the time to argue with them, but I\'m telling you the truth now. You know I never lie."" After Bacon broke the story of the Duke\'s cancer, thousands of cancer victims and their relatives wrote to Wayne saying that his battle against the disease had given them hope.      He underwent surgery to have a cancerous left lung removed on Thursday, September 17th, 1964, in a six-hour operation. Press releases at the time reported that Wayne was in Los Angeles\' Good Samaritan Hospital to be treated for lung congestion. When Hollywood columnist James Bacon went to the hospital to see Wayne, he was told by a nurse that Wayne wasn\'t having visitors. According to a Monday, June 27th, 1978, ""Us"" magazine article, Wayne said to his nurse from his room, ""Let that son of a bitch come in."" When Bacon sat down in his room, Wayne told him, ""Well, I licked the Big C."" Wayne confessed that his five-packs-a-day cigarette habit had caused a lung tumor the size of a golf ball, necessitating the removal of the entire lung. One day following surgery, Wayne began coughing so violently he ruptured his stitches and damaged delicate tissue. His face and hands began to swell up from a mixture of fluid and air, but the doctors didn\'t dare operate again so soon. Five days later they drained the fluid and repaired the stitches. On Tuesday, December 29th, 1964, Wayne held a press conference at his Encino ranch, against the advice of his agent and advisers, where he announced, ""I licked the Big C. I know the man upstairs will pull the plug when he wants to, but I don\'t want to end my life being sick. I want to go out on two feet, in action."" Before he had left the hospital on October 19th, Wayne received the news that his 52-year-old brother Robert E. Morrison had lung cancer.      Regretted playing Temujin in The Conqueror (1956) so much that he visibly shuddered whenever anyone mentioned the film\'s name. He once remarked that the moral of the film was ""not to make an ass of yourself trying to play parts you\'re not suited for.""      In 1978, after recovering from open heart surgery, he had a script commissioned for a film called ""Beau John"" in which he would star with Ron Howard, but due to his declining health it never happened. According to Howard, they saw each other at a function, and Wayne said to him that he had the script and said ""It\'s me and you kid, or it\'s NOBODY!"".      In November 2003 he once again commanded a top-ten spot in the annual Harris Poll asking Americans to name their favorite movie star. No other deceased star has achieved such ranking since Harris began asking the question in 1993. In a 2001 Gallup Poll, Americans selected Wayne as their favorite movie star of all time. He has been in the top-ten of the Harris poll each and every year it has come out, and usually in the top three. He is the only deceased actor to ever appear in this poll.      He made several films early in his career as a ""singing"" cowboy. His singing voice was supplied by a singer hidden off camera.      In 1971 he displayed a sense of humor when he appeared on The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour (1969) in his usual western screen costume, flashing the peace sign to the show\'s other guests that week, the then-hot rock band Three Dog Night.      Of his many film roles, his personal favorite was that of Ethan Edwards from The Searchers (1956). Wayne even went so far as to name his son Ethan after that character.      In 1979, as it became known that Wayne was dying of cancer, Barry Goldwater introduced legislation to award him the Congressional Gold Medal. Maureen O\'Hara and Elizabeth Taylor flew to Washington to give testimony, and signed statements in support of the motion from Frank Sinatra, Gregory Peck, Jack Lemmon, Kirk Douglas, James Stewart and Katharine Hepburn were read out. The bill was passed unanimously, and the medal was presented to the Wayne family in the following year.      In 1974, with the Vietnam war still continuing, The Harvard Lampoon invited Wayne to The Harvard Square Theater to award him the ""Brass Balls Award"" for his ""Outstanding machismo and a penchant for punching people"". Wayne accepted and arrived riding atop an armored personnel carrier manned by the ""Black Knights"" of Troop D, Fifth Regiment. Wayne took the stage and ad-libbed his way through a series of derogatory questions with adroitness, displaying an agile wit that completely won over the audience of students.      Although on May 14, 1979, John Wayne\'s son Michael did arrange a visit to his father by Archbishop Marcos McGrath of Panama, it was not until June 11, 1979, two days before he died, that John Wayne would be baptized (likely conditionally) by Fr. Robert Curtis, UCLA Medical Center chaplain.      Mentioned in many songs, including Jimmy Buffett\'s ""Incommunicado"", Tom Lehrer\'s ""Send The Marines"", Ray Stevens\' ""Beside Myself"", Paula Cole\'s ""Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?"", Queen\'s ""Bicycle Race"" and Bruce Dickinson\'s (of Iron Maiden fame) ""Sacred Cowboys"".      Along with Charlton Heston, Wayne was offered and turned down the role of Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell in Steven Spielberg\'s 1941 (1979), because he felt the film was an insult to World War II veterans, and also due to his own declining health.      Underwent surgery for an enlarged prostate in December 1976.      According to ""The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows"" (8th Edition, pg. 495), Wayne was the first choice to play Marshal Matt Dillon on Gunsmoke (1955), but declined because he did not want to commit to a weekly TV series. He did, however, recommend his friend James Arness for the role, and gave the on-camera introduction in the pilot episode. In reality Wayne was never offered a TV series in the mid-1950s as he was a major movie star.      His performance as Ethan Edwards in The Searchers (1956) is ranked #87 on Premiere Magazine\'s 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006).      After meeting the late Superman (1978) star Christopher Reeve at the 1979 Academy Awards, Wayne turned to Cary Grant and said, ""This is our new man. He\'s taking over."".      In 1973 Clint Eastwood wrote to Wayne, suggesting they star in a western together. Wayne wrote back an angry response criticizing the revisionist style and violence of Eastwood\'s latest western, High Plains Drifter (1973). Consequently Eastwood did not reply and no film was made.      His final public appearance was to present the Best Picture Oscar to The Deer Hunter (1978) at The 51st Annual Academy Awards (1979). It was not a film Wayne was fond of, since it presented a very different view of the Vietnam War than his own movie, The Green Berets (1968), had a decade earlier.      He allegedly turned down Dirty Harry (1971) because he felt the role of Harry Callahan was too far removed from his screen image. When he saw the movie he realized it wasn\'t so different from the roles he had traditionally played, and made two cop dramas of his own, McQ (1974) and Brannigan (1975). Director Don Siegel later commented, ""Wayne couldn\'t have played Harry. He was too old. He was too old to play McQ, which was a poor copy of Bullitt (1968)"".      He made three movies with Kirk Douglas, despite the fact that the two men had very different political ideologies. Wayne was a conservative Republican while Douglas was a very liberal Democrat. Wayne criticized Douglas for playing Vincent van Gogh in Lust for Life (1956), and publicly criticized him for hiring blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, one of the ""Hollywood Ten"", to write the screenplay for Spartacus (1960). Douglas later praised Wayne as a true professional who would work with anybody if he felt they were right for the part. The two made three movies together, but avoided discussing politics.      One of the most unusual Oscar moments happened when anti-war liberal Barbra Streisand presented Vietnam war hawk Wayne with his Best Actor Oscar at The 42nd Annual Academy Awards (1970).      Wayne publicly criticized director Sam Peckinpah for his film The Wild Bunch (1969), which he claimed ""destroyed the myth of the Old West"".      The inscription on the Congressional Gold Medal awarded to him in 1979 reads, simply, ""John Wayne, American.""      Although never hailed as a great actor in the classic sense, Wayne was quite accomplished on stage in high school. He even represented Glendale High School in the prestigious 1925 Southern California Shakespeare Competition, performing a passage from ""Henry VIII"".      Despite being best known as a conservative Republican, Wayne\'s politics throughout his life were fluid. He later claimed to have considered himself a socialist during his first year of college. As a young actor in Hollywood, he described himself as a liberal, and voted for Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1936 presidential election. In 1938 he attended a fund raiser for a Democratic candidate in New York, but soon afterwards ""realized Democrats didn\'t stand for the same things I did"". Henry Fonda believed Wayne called himself a liberal just so he wouldn\'t fall out with director John Ford, an activist liberal Democrat. It really wasn\'t until the 1940s that Wayne moved fully to the right on the political spectrum. But even then, he was not always in lockstep with the rest of the conservative movement - a fact that was nonetheless unknown to the public until 1978, when he openly differed with the Republican Party over the issue of the Panama Canal. Conservatives wanted America to retain full control, but Wayne, believing that the Panamanians had the right to the canal, sided with President Jimmy Carter and the Democrats to win passage of the treaty returning the canal in the Senate. Carter openly credited Wayne with being a decisive factor in convincing some Republican Senators to support the measure.      According to Michael Munn\'s ""John Wayne: The Man Behind the Myth"", in 1959, Wayne was personally told by Nikita Khrushchev, when the Soviet Premier was visiting the United States on a goodwill tour, that Joseph Stalin and China\'s Zedong Mao had each ordered Wayne to be killed. Both dictators had considered Wayne to be a leading icon of American democracy, and thus a symbol of resistance to Communism through his active support for blacklisting in Hollywood, and they believed his death would be a major morale blow to the United States. Khrushchev told Wayne he had rescinded Stalin\'s order upon his predecessor\'s demise in March 1953, but Mao supposedly continued to demand Wayne\'s assassination well into the 1960s.      His performance as Ethan Edwards in The Searchers (1956) is ranked #23 on Premiere Magazine\'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.      After seeing Wayne\'s performance in Red River (1948), directed by rival director Howard Hawks, John Ford is quoted as saying, ""I never knew the big son of a bitch could act.""      During his conservative political speeches in the late 1960s and early 1970s, students opposed to his political stances would often walk out of or boycott university film classes that screened his films.      Returned to Harvard in January 1974, at the height of his political activism, for a celebrity roast of himself. During the ceremony, the head said, ""We\'re not here to make fun of you, we\'re here to hurt your feelings."" Later, Wayne said jokingly, ""You know, I accepted this invitation over a wonderful invitation to a Jane Fonda rally."".      Wore a toupee in every film from Wake of the Red Witch (1948) for the rest of his illustrious career.During the filming of The Wings of Eagles (1957) he didn\'t wear it at all for the latter part of the film, showing the character in later life. Wayne\'s hairpiece can be seen to fall off during a fight scene in North to Alaska (1960).      Following his retirement from making movies in 1976, Wayne received thousands of letters from fans who accused him of selling out by advertising insurance in television commercials. Wayne responded that the six-figure sum he was offered to star in the advertisements was too good to refuse.      It was no surprise that Wayne would become such an enduring icon. By the early 1970s his contemporaries Humphrey Bogart, Tyrone Power, Errol Flynn, Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Paul Muni and Gary Cooper were dead. James Cagney and Cary Grant both retired from acting at 62. The careers of other stars declined considerably--both Henry Fonda and James Stewart ended up working on television series that wound up being canceled. Wayne, however, continued to star in movies until 1976, remaining one of the top ten US box-office stars until 1974.      The fact that all three of his wives were Latin-American surprised Hollywood; this was the only ""non-American"" aspect of his life. ""I have never been conscious of going for any particular type,"" Wayne said in response to a challenge from the press, ""it\'s just a happenstance"".      Wayne\'s westerns were full of action but usually not excessively violent. ""Fights with too much violence are dull,"" claimed Wayne, insisting that the straight-shooting, two-fisted violence in his movies have been ""sort of tongue-in-cheek."" He described the violence in his films as ""lusty and a little humorous,"" based on his belief that ""humor nullifies violence."" His conservative taste deplored the increasing latitude given to violence and sex in Hollywood. In the 1960s he launched a campaign against what he termed ""Hollywood\'s bloodstream polluted with perversion and immoral and amoral nuances."" Most of his westerns steered clear of graphic violence.      Wayne tried not to make films that exploited sex or violence, deploring the vulgarity and violence in Rosemary\'s Baby (1968), which he saw and did not like, and A Clockwork Orange (1971) or Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972) which he had no desire to see. He thought Deep Throat (1972) was repulsive - ""after all, it\'s pretty hard to take your daughter to see it."" And he refused to believe that Love Story (1970) ""sold because the girl went around saying \'shit\' all the way through it."" Rather, ""the American public wanted to see a little romantic story."" He took a strong stance against nudity: ""No one in any of my pictures will ever be served drinks by a girl with no top to her dress."" It was not sex per se he was against. ""Don\'t get me wrong. As far as a man and a woman are concerned, I\'m awfully happy there\'s a thing called sex,"" he said, ""It\'s an extra something God gave us, but no picture should feature the word in an unclear manner."" He therefore saw ""no reason why it shouldn\'t be in pictures,"" but it had to be ""healthy, lusty sex.""      During a visit to London in January 1974 to appear on The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour (1969) and Parkinson (1971), Wayne caught pneumonia. For a 66-year-old man with one lung this was very serious, and eventually he was coughing so hard that he damaged a valve in his heart. This problem went undetected until March 1978, when he underwent emergency open heart surgery in Boston. Bob Hope delivered a message from the The 50th Annual Academy Awards (1978), saying, ""We want you to know Duke, we miss you tonight. We expect you to amble out here in person next year, because there is nobody who can fill John Wayne\'s boots."" According to Loretta Young, that message from Hope made Wayne determined to live long enough to attend the Oscars in 1979.      On Friday, January 12th, 1979, Wayne entered hospital for gall bladder surgery, which turned in a nine and a half hour operation when doctors discovered cancer in his stomach. His entire stomach was removed. On May 2nd, Wayne returned to the hospital, where the cancer was found to have spread to his intestines. He was taken to the 9th floor of the UCLA Medical Center, where President Jimmy Carter visited him, and Queen Elizabeth II sent him a get well card. He went into a coma on Sunday, June 10th, 1979, and died at 5:35 P.M., in the late afternoon the next day, Monday, June 11th, 1979.      Although it has often been written that Wayne was dying of cancer when he made The Shootist (1976), his final film, this is not actually true. Following the removal of his entire left lung in 1964, he was cancer-free for the next 12 years. It wasn\'t until Christmas 1978 that he fell seriously ill again, and in January of the following year the cancer was found to have returned.      Ranked in the top four box office stars, as ranked by Quigley Publications\' annual poll of the Top Ten Money Making Stars, an astounding 19 times from 1949 to 1972. (Only Clint Eastwood, with 21 appearances in the Top 10 to the Duke\'s 25, has been in the Top 10, let alone the top four, more times.) He made the top three a dozen times, the top two nine times, and was the #1 box office champ four times (1950, \'51, \'54 and 1971).      Was named the #1 box office star in North America by Quigley Publications, which has published its annual Top 10 Poll of Money-Making Stars since 1932. In all, the Duke was named to Quigley Publications\' annual Top 10 Poll a record 25 times. (Clint Eastwood, with 25 appearances in the Top 10, is #2, and Wayne\'s contemporary Gary Cooper, with 18 appearances, is tied for #3 with Tom Cruise.) Wayne had the longest ride on the list, first appearing on it in 1949 and making it every year but one (1958) through 1974. In four of those years he was No. 1.      In a 1960 interview Wayne criticized the homosexual themes of Suddenly, Last Summer (1959) and They Came to Cordura (1959).      Wayne appeared in a very uncomplimentary light in the Public Enemy song ""Fight the Power,"" from the 1990 album ""Fear of a Black Planet"". Wayne has frequently come under fire for alleged racist remarks he made about black people and Native American Indians in his infamous Playboy magazine interview from May 1971. He was also criticized by some for supporting Senator Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election, after Goldwater had voted against the Civil Rights Act. However; it turned out that Goldwater was not as intolerant as people thought, and was quite progressive in his thinking on integration, but hindsight tends to rule the day.      Wayne denounced the subject of homosexuality in Tennessee Williams\' Suddenly, Last Summer (1959) as ""too disgusting even for discussion""--even though he had not seen it and had no intention of seeing it. ""It is too distasteful,"" he claimed, ""to be put on a screen designed to entertain a family, or any member of a decent family."" He considered the youth-oriented, anti-establishment film Easy Rider (1969) and Midnight Cowboy (1969), which to his dismay won the Best Picture Oscar in 1970, as ""perverted"" films. Especially when early in ""Midnight Cowboy"" Jon Voight dons his newly acquired Western duds and, posing in front of a mirror, utters the only words likely to come to mind at the moment one becomes a cowboy: ""John Wayne!"" Wayne told Playboy magazine, ""Wouldn\'t you say that the wonderful love of these two men in \'Midnight Cowboy\', a story about two fags, qualifies as a perverse movie?"".      In 1971, owing to the success of Big Jake (1971), he was #1 at the US box office for the last time.      By the early 1960s, 161 of his films had grossed $350 million, and he had been paid as much as $666,000 to make a movie.      Due to his political activism, in 1968 Wayne was asked to be the segregationist Governor of Alabama George Wallace\'s running mate in that year\'s presidential election. Wayne\'s response made headlines: ""Wayne Wallace candidates? Wayne SAID \'B------t!\'"", as if he was shouting to the reporters.      While visiting the troops in Vietnam in June 1966, a bullet struck Wayne\'s bicycle. Although he was not within 100 yards of it at the time, the newspapers reported he had narrowly escaped death at the hands of a sniper.      In December 1978, just a month before he was diagnosed with stomach cancer, he joined Bob Hope and Johnny Carson in offering his services to speak out publicly against government corruption, poverty, crime and drug abuse.      Producer-director Robert Rossen offered the role of Willie Stark in All the King\'s Men (1949) to Wayne. Rossen sent a copy of the script to Wayne\'s agent, Charles K. Feldman,who forwarded it to Wayne. After reading the script, Wayne sent it back with an angry letter attached. In it, he told Feldman that before he sent the script to any of his other clients, he should ask them if they wanted to star in a film that ""smears the machinery of government for no purpose of humor or enlightenment"", that ""degrades all relationships"", and that is populated by ""drunken mothers; conniving fathers; double-crossing sweethearts; bad, bad, rich people; and bad, bad poor people if they want to get ahead."" He accused Rossen of wanting to make a movie that threw acid on ""the American way of life."" If Feldman had such clients, Wayne wrote that the agent should ""rush this script . . . to them."" Wayne, however, said to the agent that ""you can take this script and shove it up Robert Rossen\'s derriere."" Wayne later remarked that ""to make Huey Long a wonderful, rough pirate was great, but, according to this picture, everybody was shit except for this weakling intern doctor who was trying to find a place in the world."" Broderick Crawford, who had played a supporting role in Wayne\'s Seven Sinners (1940),eventually got the part of Stark. In a bit of irony, Crawford was Oscar-nominated for the part of Stark and found himself competing against Wayne, who was nominated the same year for Sands of Iwo Jima (1949). Crawford won the Best Actor Oscar.      His image was so far-reaching that when Emperor Hirohito visited America in 1975, he asked to meet the veteran star. Wayne was quoted in the Chicago Sun Times as saying, ""I must have killed off the entire Japanese army.""      Allegedly thrust his Best Actor Oscar for True Grit (1969) to Richard Burton at the The 42nd Annual Academy Awards (1970), telling the Welsh actor, ""You should have this, not me.""      During the Vietnam War he was highly critical of teenagers who went to Europe to dodge the draft, calling them ""cowards"", ""traitors"" and ""communists"".      Despite his numerous alleged anti-gay remarks in interviews over the years,Wayne co-starred with Rock Hudson in The Undefeated (1969), even though he knew of the actor\'s homosexuality. In this Civil War epic, the champion of political conservatism worked well with and even became good friends with Hudson, Hollywood\'s gayest (although it wasn\'t publicly known at the time) leading man.They remained good friends until Wayne\'s death in 1979.      In 1971 Wayne and James Stewart were traveling to Ronald Reagan\'s second inauguration as Governor of California when they encountered some anti-war demonstrators with a Vietcong flag. Stewart\'s stepson Ronald had been killed in Vietnam in 1969. Wayne walked over to speak to the protesters and within minutes the flag had been lowered.      In the final years of his life, with the resignation of President Richard Nixon and the end of the Vietnam War, Wayne\'s political beliefs appeared to have moderated. He attended the inauguration of President Jimmy Carter on 20 January 1977, and along with his fellow conservative James Stewart he could be seen applauding Jane Fonda at The American Film Institute Salute to Henry Fonda (1978). Later in 1978, Wayne uncharacteristically sided with the Democrats and President Carter against his fellow conservative Republicans over the issue of the Panama Canal, which Wayne believed belonged to the people of Panama and not the United States of America.      Offered Charlton Heston the roles of Jim Bowie and Col. William Travis in The Alamo (1960), saying the young actor would be ideal for either part. Heston declined the offer because he did not want to be directed by Wayne, and because he feared the critical response to the ideologically conservative movie. Wayne intended the epic to be an allegory for America\'s Cold War with the Soviet Union.      Separated from his wife Pilar Wayne in 1973, though they never divorced. When Louis Johnson, his business partner, sold all of their holdings in Arizona, The 26 Bar Ranch and the Red River Land and Cattle Company, Wayne\'s children got one half of it, $24,000,000. Pilar had already been taken care of at their separation.      Although media reports suggested he was to attend Elvis Presley\'s funeral in August 1977, Wayne didn\'t show up for it. Presley had once been considered for Glen Campbell\'s role in True Grit (1969). The reason Presley did not appear in the film, was that his manager told Wayne that the only way Presley would appear is for and outrageous sum of money, plus top billing OVER Wayne, so needless to say, those demands were not met.      Re-mortgaged his house in Hollywood in order to finance The Alamo (1960). While the movie was a success internationally, it lost him a great deal of money personally. For the next four years he had to make one film after another, including The Longest Day (1962), for which he was paid $250,000 for four days work. By early 1962 his financial problems were resolved.      Honored with an Army RAH-66 helicopter, named ""The Duke"". Many people attended the naming ceremony in Washington, DC, on May 12, 1998, including his children and grandchildren, congressmen, the president of the USO Metropolitan Washington, dignitaries and many military personnel. His eldest son Michael Wayne said at the ceremony, ""John Wayne loved his country and he loved its traditions"".      In 1973 he was honored with the Veterans of Foreign Wars highest award The National Americanism Gold Medal.      Produced and starred in a 1940s radio show about an alcoholic detective titled ""Three Sheets to the Wind"".      When he was honored with a square at the Grauman\'s Chinese Theater in Hollywood the sand used in the cement was brought in from Iwo Jima, in honor of his film Sands of Iwo Jima (1949).      ""The Greatest Cowboy Star of All Time"" was the caption to a series of comic books dedicated to him. The ""John Wayne Adventure Comics"" were first published in 1949.      His image appeared on a wide variety of products including: 1950 popcorn trading cards given at theaters, 1951 Camel cigarettes, 1956 playing cards, Whitman\'s Chocolates and - posthumously - Coors beer. The money collected on the Coors beer cans with his image went to the John Wayne Cancer Institute. One of the most unusual was as a puppet on H.R. Pufnstuf (1969), who also put out a 1970 lunch box with his image among the other puppet characters.Barry Goldwater visited the set of Stagecoach (1939) during filming. They had a long friendship and in 1964 Wayne helped in Goldwater\'s presidential campaign.      After his third wife Pilar Wayne left him in 1973, Wayne became (happily) involved with his secretary Pat Stacy for the remaining six years of his life.      Cited as America\'s favorite movie star in a Harris Poll conducted in 1995.      In his films Wayne often surrounded himself with a group of friends/fellow actors (often unknown names but recognized faces), such as Ward Bond, Jim Hutton, Bruce Cabot, Ben Johnson, Edward Faulkner, Jay C. Flippen, Richard Boone, Chuck Roberson and his son, Patrick Wayne.      Directed most of The Comancheros (1961) because credited director Michael Curtiz was dying of cancer and was often too ill to work. Wayne refused to be credited as a co-director.      Gave the eulogy at the funerals of Ward Bond, John Ford and Howard Hawks.      Had plastic surgery to remove the lines around his eyes in 1969, which left him with black eyes and forced him to wear dark glasses for two weeks. He also had surgery to remove the jowls around his mouth.      Worked with Robert Mitchum\'s youngest son Christopher Mitchum in three films, Chisum (1970), Rio Lobo (1970) and Big Jake (1971). Wayne had intended on Christopher becoming part of his regular stock company of supporting actors, but fell out with him in 1973 in an argument over politics. Wayne told him, ""I didn\'t know you was a pinko."".      Some of his films during the mid-1950s were less successful, forcing Wayne to work with pop singers in order to attract young audiences. He acted alongside Ricky Nelson in Rio Bravo (1959), Frankie Avalon in The Alamo (1960) and Fabian in North to Alaska (1960).      Wayne was buried in secret and the grave went unmarked until 1999, in case Vietnam War protesters desecrated the site. Twenty years after his death he finally received a headstone made of bronze which was engraved with a quotation from his infamous Playboy interview.      Wayne nearly got into a fight with British film critic Barry Norman on two occasions, both times over politics. In November 1963, on the set of Circus World (1964), the two had a serious argument over Barry Goldwater\'s presidential campaign. Nearly six years later, while Wayne was promoting True Grit (1969), the two nearly came to blows on a train over the Vietnam War. Despite this, Norman wrote favorably of Wayne as an actor in his book ""The Hollywood Greats"" (1986).      Listed in the 1910 U.S. Census as Marion R. Morrison, living with his parents in Madison, Iowa.      In 1920, lived at 404 N. Isabel Street, Glendale, California, according to U.S. Census.      While filming True Grit (1969), Wayne was trying to keep his weight off with drugs - uppers for the day, downers to sleep at night. Occasionally, he got the pills mixed up, and this led to problems on a The Dean Martin Show (1965) taping in 1969. Instead of taking an upper before leaving for the filming, he took a downer - and was ready to crash by the time he arrived on the set. ""I can\'t do our skit,"" Wayne reportedly told Martin when it was time to perform. ""I\'m too doped up. Goddamn, I look half smashed!"" Naturally, Martin didn\'t have a problem with that. ""Hell, Duke, people think I do the show that way all the time!"" The taping went on as scheduled.      Although he actively supported Ronald Reagan\'s failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976, Wayne paid a visit to the White House as a guest of President Jimmy Carter for his inauguration. ""I\'m pleased to be present and accounted for in this capital of freedom to witness history as it happens - to watch a common man accept the uncommon responsibility he won \'fair and square\' by stating his case to the American people - not by bloodshed, be-headings, and riots at the palace gates. I know I\'m a member of the loyal opposition - accent on the loyal. I\'d have it no other way."".Pilar Wayne wrote in her book ""My Life with The Duke"": ""Duke always said family came first, career second, and his interest in politics third. In fact, although he loved the children and me, there were times when we couldn\'t compete with his career or his devotion to the Republican Party."".      After Ronald Reagan\'s election as Governor of California in 1966, Wayne was exiting a victory celebration when he was asked by police not to leave the building - a mob of 300 angry anti-war demonstrators were waiting outside. Instead of cowering indoors, Wayne confronted the demonstrators head on. When protesters waved the Viet Cong flag under his nose, Wayne grew impatient. ""Please don\'t do that fellows,"" Duke warned the assembled. ""I\'ve seen too many kids your age wounded or dead because of that flag. So I don\'t take too kindly to it."" The demonstrators persisted, so he chased a group of them down an alley.      In 1975, for the first time since his arrival in Hollywood 47 years earlier, he did not act in any movies. Production began in January of the following year for his last, The Shootist (1976).      In 1967 Wayne wrote to Democratic President Lyndon Johnson requesting military assistance for his pro-war film about Vietnam. Jack Valenti told the President, ""Wayne\'s politics are wrong, but if he makes this film he will be helping us."" Wayne got enough firepower to make The Green Berets (1968), which became one of the most controversial movies of all time.      In 1960 Frank Sinatra hired a blacklisted screenwriter, Albert Maltz, to write an anti-war screenplay for a film to be called ""The Execution of Private Slovik"", based on a William Bradford Huie book about the only US soldier to be executed for desertion during World War II. Wayne, who had actively supported the Joseph McCarthy anti-Communist witch hunts for nearly 20 years, recalled, ""When I heard about it, I was so goddamn mad I told a reporter, \'I wonder how Sinatra\'s crony, Senator John F. Kennedy, feels about Sinatra hiring such a man\'. The whole thing became a minefield . . . I heard that Kennedy put pressure on Frank and he had to back down . . . He ended up paying Maltz $75,000 not to write the goddamn thing"". The film wasn\'t made for another 14 years (The Execution of Private Slovik (1974)).      Campaigned for Sam Yorty in the 1969 election for Mayor of Los Angeles.      His great-nephew Tommy Morrison was diagnosed with HIV in 1996.      Announced his intention to campaign for Senator Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election after Goldwater had voted against the Civil Rights Act. Although diagnosed with lung cancer and forced to undergo major surgery in September, Wayne still managed to host a TV special for Goldwater in October.      Directed most of Big Jake (1971) himself because director George Sherman, an old friend from Wayne\'s days at Republic, was in his mid-60s and ill at the time, and not up to the rigors of directing an action picture in the wilds of Mexico, where much of the film was shot. Wayne refused to take co-director credit.      His TV appearances in the late 1960s showed that Wayne had overcome his indifference to television. In addition to appearing on The Dean Martin Show (1965), The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour (1969), he became a semi-regular visitor to Laugh-In (1967), often good-naturedly spoofing his macho image and even dressing up as The Easter Bunny in a famous 1972 episode.      After he finally won the Best Actor Oscar for True Grit (1969) his career declined. Chisum (1970), seemingly having little to do with Wayne, was released to mixed reviews and moderate business. Rio Lobo (1970) received very poor critical reception and proved to be a commercial disappointment. Big Jake (1971), pumped up with graphic action scenes and plenty of humor, made twice as much money as either of the previous two films. However, The Cowboys (1972) struggled to find an audience when first released, despite the fact that it received positive reviews and featured a very different performance from Wayne as an aging cattleman. The Train Robbers (1973) was largely forgettable and Cahill U.S. Marshal (1973) garnered him his worst reviews since The Conqueror (1956). His attempts to emulate Clint Eastwood as a tough detective were generally ridiculed due to his age, increasing weight and the predictable nature of the plots. McQ (1974) was only a moderate success and Brannigan (1975), although it was a better picture, made even less money. A sequel to True Grit (1969) titled Rooster Cogburn (1975), co-starring Katharine Hepburn, was critically reviled, but managed to be a minor hit. For the first time Wayne gave serious thought to retirement; however, he was able to make one final movie, a stark story of a gunfighter dying of cancer called The Shootist (1976) which, although Wayne received some of the best reviews of his career, struggled to get its money back.      Wayne did not serve during World War II. Knee injuries he received in college kept him from running the distances required by military standards.      Was a member of the conservative John Birch Society.      Campaigned for Gerald Ford in the 1976 presidential election.      At the Memorial Day finale at Knott\'s Berry Farm in Anaheim in 1964, Wayne and Rock Hudson flanked Ronald Reagan as the future President led 27,000 Goldwater enthusiasts in a roaring Pledge of Allegiance.      In 1965, after his battle with lung cancer, Wayne moved out of Hollywood to Newport Beach, where he lived until his death 14 years later. His house was demolished after he died.      During the early 1960s Wayne traveled extensively to Panama. During this time, the star reportedly purchased the island of Taborcillo off the main coast of Panama. It was sold by his estate after his death and changed many hands before being opened as a tourist attraction.Lauren Bacall once recalled that while Wayne hardly knew her husband Humphrey Bogart at all, he was the first to send flowers and good wishes after Bogart was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in January 1956.      Along with Humphrey Bogart, Wayne was regarded as the heaviest smoker in Hollywood, sustaining five packs of unfiltered Camels until his first battle with cancer in 1964. While recovering from losing his lung he began to chew tobacco, and then he started smoking cigars.      He lost the leading role in The Gunfighter (1950) to Gregory Peck because of his refusal to work for Columbia Pictures after Columbia chief Harry Cohn had mistreated him years before as a young contract player (Cohn had heard a rumor, which turned out to be untrue, that Waynel was pursuing a young starlet that Cohn was already having an affair with, and had him blackballed among the other Hollywood studios). Cohn had bought the _""The Gunfighter"" project specifically with Wayne in mind for it, but Wayne\'s grudge was too deep, and Cohn sold the script to Twentieth Century-Fox, which cast Peck in the role Wayne badly wanted but refused to bend for. When the Reno Chamber of Commerce named Peck the top western star for 1950 and presented him with the Silver Spurs award, an angry Wayne said, ""Well, who the hell decided that you were the best cowboy of the year?"". Wayne also reportedly turned down the lead in ""Twelve O\'Clock High,"" which also became an iconic part for Peck.      He was badly sunburnt while filming 3 Godfathers (1948) and was briefly hospitalized.Robert Aldrich, then president of the Directors Guild of America, stated in support of awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Wayne in 1979: ""It is important for you to know that I am a registered Democrat and, to my knowledge, share none of the political views espoused by Duke. However, whether he is ill- disposed or healthy, John Wayne is far beyond the normal political sharp-shooting in this community. Because of his courage, his dignity, his integrity, and because of his talents as an actor, his strength as a leader, his warmth as a human being throughout his illustrious career, he is entitled to a unique spot in our hearts and minds. In this industry, we often judge people, sometimes unfairly, by asking whether they have paid their dues. John Wayne has paid his dues over and over, and I\'m proud to consider him a friend, and am very much in favor of my Government recognizing in some important fashion the contribution that Mr. Wayne has made."".      He regarded Rio Bravo (1959) as the film marking his transition into middle age. At 51 Wayne was starting to get overweight and he believed he was too old to play the romantic lead any more. His last four movies since The Searchers (1956) had been unsuccessful, and he felt the only way to keep audiences coming was to revert to playing ""John Wayne"" in every film.      Broke his leg while filming Legend of the Lost (1957).      Fittingly, Wayne was buried in Orange County, the most Republican district in the United States. The conservative residents admired Wayne so much that they named their international airport after him. It is about four miles from the cemetery where he is buried.      At one time Wayne was considered for Rock Hudson\'s role as rancher Bick Benedict in George Stevens\'s epic western Giant (1956).      He had intended to make a trilogy of films featuring the character Rooster Cogburn, but the third film was canceled after Rooster Cogburn (1975) proved to be only a moderate hit at the box office. The third film was intended to be called ""Sometime"".      In the mid-1930s Wayne was hired by Columbia Pictures to make several westerns for its ""B"" unit. Columbia chief Harry Cohn, a married man, soon got the idea that Wayne had made a pass at a Columbia starlet with whom Cohn was having an affair. When he confronted Wayne about it Wayne denied it, but Cohn called up executives at other studios and told them that Wayne would show up for work drunk, was a womanizer and a troublemaker and requested that they not hire him. Wayne didn\'t work for several months afterward, and when he discovered what Cohn had done, he burst into Cohn\'s office at Columbia, grabbed him by the neck and threatened to kill him. After he cooled off he told Cohn that ""as long as I live, I will never work one day for you or Columbia no matter how much you offer me."" Later, after Wayne had become a major star, he received several lucrative film offers from Columbia, including the lead in The Gunfighter (1950), all of which he turned down cold. Even after Cohn died in 1958, Wayne still refused to entertain any offers whatsoever from Columbia Pictures, including several that would have paid him more than a a million dollars.      The Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, issued a proclamation making 26 May 2007 ""John Wayne Day"" in California.      Bought a 135-foot yacht called ""The Wild Goose"" in 1962. Wayne agreed to make Circus World (1964), a film he hated, just so he could sail the vessel to Europe.      In 1962 he was paid a record $250,000 for four days work on The Longest Day (1962), and in the following year he was paid the same amount for two days work on The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965).      On 20 August 2007, the Republican Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver announced that Wayne will be inducted into the California Hall of Fame located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts in Sacramento on 5 December 2007.      After undergoing major lung surgery in 1964, Wayne would sometimes have to use an oxygen mask to breathe for the rest of his life. An oxygen tank was always kept in his trailer on locations. His breathing problems were particularly severe on airplanes, and while filming True Grit (1969) and Rooster Cogburn (1975), due to the high altitude. No photographs were allowed to be taken by the press of the veteran star breathing through an oxygen mask.      Often stated how he wished his first Oscar nomination had been for She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) instead of Sands of Iwo Jima (1949).      Ranked #11 in the 100 Most Influential People in the History of the Movies, according to the authors of the Film 100 Web site.      He has 25 appearances in the Top 10 at the US Box Office: 1949-1957 and 1959-1974.      Prior to making The Big Trail (1930), director Raoul Walsh told Wayne to take acting lessons. Wayne duly took three lessons, but gave up when the teacher told him he had no talent.      He was a member of the National Rifle Association (NRA).      Voice actor Peter Cullen based the voice of his most famous character, heroic Autobot leader Optimus Prime from Transformers (2007), on the voice of John Wayne.      In the late 1970s Wayne made a series of commercials for the Great Western Savings Bank in Los Angeles. The day after the first one aired, a man walked into a GW Bank branch in West Hollywood with a suitcase, asked to see the bank manager, and when he was shown to the manager\'s desk, he opened up the suitcase to reveal $500,000 in cash. He said, ""If your bank is good enough for John Wayne, it\'s good enough for me."" He had just closed his business and personal accounts at a rival bank down the street and walked to the GW branch to open accounts there because John Wayne had endorsed it.      Actor and later California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger cited Wayne as a role model from his childhood.      On Wednesday, January 25th, 1950, he became the 125th star to put his hand and footprints outside of Grauman\'s Chinese Theatre.      His Oscar win for True Grit (1969) was widely seen as more of a lifetime achievement award, since his performance had been criticized as over-the-top and hammy. In his Reader\'s Digest article on Wayne from October 1979, Ronald Reagan wrote that the award was both in recognition of his whole career, and to make up for him not receiving nominations for Red River (1948), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and The Searchers (1956).The Shootist (1976) is widely considered the best final film by any major star, rivaled only by Clark Gable\'s role in The Misfits (1961) and Henry Fonda\'s role in On Golden Pond (1981).      During his career his movies grossed an estimated half a billion dollars worldwide.      Spoilers: Of the near 200 films Wayne made, he died in only eight: Reap the Wild Wind (1942) (octopus attack), The Fighting Seabees (1944) (gunshot/explosion), Wake of the Red Witch (1948) (drowning), Sands of Iwo Jima (1949) (gunshot wounds), The Alamo (1960) (lance/explosion), The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) (natural causes), The Cowboys (1972) (gunshot wounds) and The Shootist (1976) (shotgun wounds). His fate in The Sea Chase (1955) is undetermined - he may have died when his ship sank, or he (and Lana Turner) may have made it to shore.      His father died of a heart attack in March 1937.      He very much wanted the role of Wild Bill Hickok in The Plainsman (1936), which he felt certain would make him a star, but director Cecil B. DeMille wanted Gary Cooper instead.Michael Caine recalled in his 1992 autobiography ""What\'s It All About?"" that Wayne gave him two pieces of advice when they first met in Hollywood early in 1967. Firstly, on acting, Wayne told him, ""Talk low, talk slow, and don\'t talk too much."" Then Wayne added, ""And never wear suede shoes. One time I was taking a piss when a guy next to me turned round and said, \'John Wayne!\', and pissed all over my shoes."".      His first wife Josephine Alicia Saenz died of cancer in 2003, at the age of 94.      Actors Steve McQueen, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Chuck Norris all cited Wayne as a huge influence on them, both professionally and personally. Like Wayne, each man rose to fame playing men of heroic action. Also, like Wayne, each man is a supporter of conservative causes and the Republican party, the exception being McQueen who, although a lifelong Republican, died in 1980.      Gave Sammy Davis Jr. the first cowboy hat he ever wore in a film.      After leaving the stage, during 1979\'s Academy Awards ceremony, he was greeted by his old pal Sammy Davis Jr., who gave him a big bear hug. Davis later told a friend he regretted hugging Wayne so hard in his fragile condition, but he was told that ""Duke Wouldn\'t have missed that hug for anything"" (the idea of the 125-pound Davis worrying about hugging him ""too hard"" was a sad commentary on Wayne\'s failing health).      Wayne was asked to be the running mate for Alabama Governor George Wallace, who was running for the US presidency on a segregationist ticket in 1968, but Wayne vehemently rejected the offer and actively campaigned for Richard Nixon. He addressed the Republican National Convention on its opening day in August 1968.      In his later years Wayne lived near Newport Beach, just south of Los Angeles, where he had a beach house and a yacht, ""The Wild Goose"". His house has been torn down, but The Wild Goose sails on. It\'s now a tour boat offering dinner cruises to Wayne fans young and old alike. Originally a decommissioned Navy minesweeper, it was rebuilt and customized by Wayne as a yacht; the custom interior has polished wood almost everywhere you look. It was there that in his later years he often entertained, hosting card games with his good friends Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and other name stars of the time.      On Monday, May 18th, 1953, during divorce proceedings from his second wife Esperanza Baur, Wayne\'s annual gross income was publicly revealed to be $502,891.      Visited Stepin Fetchit in hospital in 1976 after the actor had suffered a stroke which ended his career.      He considered Maureen O\'Hara one of his best friends; over the years he was more open to her than anyone. When asked about her he always replied, ""The greatest guy I ever knew."" They were friends for 39 years, from 1940 until his death in 1979. Today she is considered by many to be his best leading lady; they starred in five films together. She referred to a wing in her home as the ""John Wayne Wing"".      Great Western Savings erected a bronze statue by Harry Jackson of Wayne on a horse at its headquarters in Beverly Hills. Although the building was later bought by Larry Flynt, the statue still stands at its original location.      He appeared in at least one film for every year from 1926-76, a record of 51 consecutive years. He did not act in a movie in 1975, though both Brannigan (1975) and Rooster Cogburn (1975) were released in that year.      Aa a young man, Ethan Wayne was never allowed to leave the house without carrying cards that his father had autographed to hand out to fans.      According to Mel Brooks in his commentary of Blazing Saddles (1974), he wanted Wayne as The Waco Kid. Wayne told Brooks that he thought the script was ""funny as hell"", but said it was ""too dirty,"" and his fans would never accept him in the role. He also said he would do anything he could to help him get the picture made, and be the first in line to see it when it came out.      In 1959 he was considered for the role of the sergeant in a film that director Samuel Fuller wanted to make about his war experiences, ""The Big Red One"". When the film was finally made in 1980, The Big Red One (1980), the role went to Lee Marvin after Fuller asked that Wayne be replaced so as not to overshadow his film\'s story.      In the DVD documentary for 1941 (1979), Steven Spielberg says he first met Wayne at the memorial service for Joan Crawford. The two became friends and Spielberg offered the role of Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell to Wayne. He sent Wayne the script and got a call back the same day, criticizing Spielberg for making a film that Wayne felt was anti-American. The two remained friends and never discussed the film again. Spielberg says that later on Wayne pitched him a script idea about a camel race in Morocco starring Wayne and long-time friend and co-star Maureen O\'Hara. Spielberg says it sounded like a good idea. However, Wayne later passed away and the film was never made.      Longtime friend of Harry Morgan.      Was a Boy Scout.      Was the acting mentor to actor James Arness.      In April 2014, he was honored as Turner Classic Movie\'s Star of the Month.      When wife Chata charged that Wayne had an affair with Gail Russell in their divorce proceedings, the actor countered that Nicky Hilton Rothschild had become a constant house-guest of Chata\'s.      In response to the Californian senate voting against celebrating May 26 as ""John Wayne Day"" in 2016, the state of Texas declared that it would celebrate ""John Wayne Day"".      Wayne\'s name consistently came up over the years for proposals that he portray WWII General George S. Patton. Through the 1950\'s studios proposed films about Patton, but Patton\'s family objected to such projects and objected to Wayne specifically. In the mid 1960\'s he was director \'Michael Anderson\'\'s choice to play Patton in a Columbia Pictures epic, ""16th of December: The Battle of the Bulge"", which had the blessing of Eisenhower and the Defence Department, but the project was abandoned after Warner Brothers appropriated the title Battle of the Bulge (1965) for a generic war film with Henry Fonda. Finally Wayne was considered in the role for Patton (1970) ultimately played by George C. Scott, turning it down at one point, a decision he reportedly later regretted.      Is portrayed by David James Elliott in Trumbo (2015).      Often billed as 6\'4"", although Wayne said his exact height was 6\'3 3/4"".      Shortly before he began filming Legend of the Lost (1957) Wayne was devastated when the US government sided with the Soviet Union during the Suez Crisis, and took no action in response to the Soviet invasion of Hungary. Wayne believed Richard Nixon learned from the mistakes of November 1956 to correctly handle the Yom Kippur War in 1973.      In 2014 Marc Eliot\'s book ""American Titan: Searching for John Wayne"" alleged that Wayne deliberately avoided enlisting in the armed forces during World War II because he was afraid it would end the affair he was having with Marlene Dietrich. He also feared military service might end his career as he would be too old to be ""an action-oriented leading man"".      According to the families of John Wayne, legendary directory John Ford, and Harry Carey Jr., Wayne\'s iconic ""rolling walk"" was developed during the filming of the classic Stagecoach (1939) by Duke and character actor Paul Fix, Carey\'s father-in-law (who wasn\'t in the film). This walk helped set Wayne apart from everyone else, and gave him more of an ""edge"" over other male actors of the day.      He appeared as a guest on the second episode of The Dean Martin Show (1965).      In 1960 he publicly condemned Frank Sinatra for trying to make a film version of ""The Execution of Private Slovik"" to be written by the blacklisted screenwriter Albert Maltz. Sinatra was forced to abandon the project after pressure from John F. Kennedy, whose presidential campaign he was actively supporting.      One of the referendum issues on the California ballot in the 1972 elections was a proposition that would have rigidly codified public obscenity laws, encouraging arrests of pornography peddlers. Wayne, and nearly two thirds of California\'s voters, found the proposition repressive and untenable. In a radio commercial he told voters, ""You don\'t get rid of a bad situation with a badly written law, or cut off a foot to cure a sore toe."".      He separated from his third wife Pilar in 1967 while he was filming The Green Berets (1968). However they did not publicly announce their separation until 1973.      Plans to declare 26 May as John Wayne Day in California were rejected in April 2016 over allegedly racist comments the actor made in his May 1971 interview with ""Playboy"" magazine.

[at Harvard in 1974, on being asked whether then-President Richard Nixon ever advised him on the making of his films] No, they\'ve all been successful.      [on presenting the Best Picture Oscar in 1979] Oscar and I have something in common. Oscar first came to the Hollywood scene in 1928. So did I. We\'re both a little weatherbeaten, but we\'re still here and plan to be around for a whole lot longer.      When people say a John Wayne picture got bad reviews, I always wonder if they know it\'s a redundant sentence, but hell, I don\'t care. People like my pictures and that\'s all that counts.      [When asked if he believed in God] There must be some higher power or how else does all this stuff work?      [Time Magazine interview, 1969] I would like to be remembered, well . . . the Mexicans have a phrase, ""Feo fuerte y formal"". Which means he was ugly, strong and had dignity.      [poem, ""The Sky"", he read on his 1969 Laugh-In (1967) appearance] The sky is blue, the grass is green. Get off your ass and join the Marines.      [upon accepting his Oscar for True Grit (1969)] If I\'d known this was all it would take, I\'d have put that eyepatch on 40 years ago.      I\'m an American actor. I work with my clothes on. I have to. Riding a horse can be pretty tough on your legs and elsewheres.      [on Native Americans:] I don\'t feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them. There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves.      When I started, I knew I was no actor and I went to work on this Wayne thing. It was as deliberate a projection as you\'ll ever see. I figured I needed a gimmick, so I dreamed up the drawl, the squint and a way of moving meant to suggest that I wasn\'t looking for trouble but would just as soon throw a bottle at your head as not. I practiced in front of a mirror.      Communism is quite obviously still a threat. Yes, they are human beings, with a right to their point of view . . .      [on being asked about his ""phony hair"" at Harvard in 1974] It\'s not phony. It\'s real hair. Of course, it\'s not mine, but it\'s real.      I never had a goddamn artistic problem in my life, never, and I\'ve worked with the best of them. John Ford isn\'t exactly a bum, is he? Yet he never gave me any manure about art. He just made movies and that\'s what I do.      God-damn, I\'m the stuff men are made of!      I was overwhelmed by the feeling of friendship, comradeship, and brotherhood . . . DeMolay will always hold a deep spot in my heart.      [on the Oscars] You can\'t eat awards -- nor, more to the point, drink \'em.      I made up my mind that I was going to play a real man to the best of my ability. I felt many of the western stars of the twenties and thirties were too goddamn perfect. They never drank or smoked. They never wanted to go to bed with a beautiful girl. They never had a fight. A heavy might throw a chair at them, and they just looked surprised and didn\'t fight in this spirit. They were too goddamn sweet and pure to be dirty fighters. Well, I wanted to be a dirty fighter if that was the only way to fight back. If someone throws a chair at you, hell, you pick up a chair and belt him right back. I was trying to play a man who gets dirty, who sweats sometimes, who enjoys kissing a gal he likes, who gets angry, who fights clean whenever possible but will fight dirty if he has to. You could say I made the western hero a roughneck.      [on America] I can tell you why I love her. I have a lust for her dignity. I look at her wonderfully classic face, and I see hidden in it a sense of humor that I love. I think of wonderful, exciting, decent things when I look at her . . .      Courage is being scared to death - and saddling up anyway.      I stick to simple themes. Love. Hate. No nuances. I stay away from psychoanalyst\'s couch scenes. Couches are good for one thing.      Every country in the world loved the folklore of the West - the music, the dress, the excitement, everything that was associated with the opening of a new territory. It took everybody out of their own little world. The cowboy lasted a hundred years, created more songs and prose and poetry than any other folk figure. The closest thing was the Japanese samurai. Now, I wonder who\'ll continue it.      I am a demonstrative man, a baby picker-upper, a hugger and a kisser - that\'s my nature.      I don\'t act . . . I react.      I have found a certain type calls himself a liberal . . . Now I always thought I was a liberal. I came up terribly surprised one time when I found out that I was a right-wing conservative extremist, when I listened to everybody\'s point of view that I ever met, and then decided how I should feel. But this so-called new liberal group, Jesus, they never listen to your point of view . . .      There\'s been a lot of stories about how I got to be called Duke. One was that I played the part of a duke in a school play--which I never did. Sometimes, they even said I was descended from royalty! It was all a lot of rubbish. Hell, the truth is that I was named after a dog!      Westerns are closer to art than anything else in the motion picture business.      We must always look to the future. Tomorrow - the time that gives a man just one more chance - is one of the many things that I feel are wonderful in life. So\'s a good horse under you. Or the only campfire for miles around. Or a quiet night and a nice soft hunk of ground to sleep on. A mother meeting her first-born. The sound of a kid calling you dad for the first time. There\'s a lot of things great about life. But I think tomorrow is the most important thing. Comes in to us at midnight very clean. It\'s perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we\'ve learned something from yesterday.      I do not want the government to take away my human dignity and insure me anything more than a normal security. I don\'t want handouts.      I don\'t think a fella should be able to sit on his backside and receive welfare. I\'d like to know why well-educated idiots keep apologizing for lazy and complaining people who think the world owes them a living. I\'d like to know why they make excuses for cowards who spit in the faces of the police and then run behind the judicial sob sisters. I can\'t understand these people who carry placards to save the life of some criminal, yet have no thought for the innocent victim.      I want to play a real man in all my films, and I define manhood simply: men should be tough, fair, and courageous, never petty, never looking for a fight, but never backing down from one either.      I don\'t want ever to appear in a film that would embarrass a viewer. A man can take his wife, mother, and his daughter to one of my movies and never be ashamed or embarrassed for going.      I am an old-fashioned, honest-to-goodness, flag-waving patriot.      You can\'t whine and bellyache because somebody else got a good break and you didn\'t.      I think that the loud roar of irresponsible liberalism . . . is being quieted down by a reasoning public. I think the pendulum is swinging back. We\'re remembering that the past can\'t be so bad. We built a nation on it. We have to look to tomorrow.      Very few of the so-called liberals are open-minded . . . they shout you down and won\'t let you speak if you disagree with them.      Some people tell me everything isn\'t black and white. But I say why the hell not?High Noon (1952) was the most un-American thing I have ever seen in my whole life. The last thing in the picture is ol\' Coop [Gary Cooper] putting the United States marshal\'s badge under his foot and stepping on it. I\'ll never regret having run [screenwriter Carl Foreman] out of this country.      God, how I hate solemn funerals. When I die, take me into a room and burn me. Then my family and a few good friends should get together, have a few good belts, and talk about the crazy old time we all had together.      I\'ve always had deep faith that there is a Supreme Being, there has to be. To me that\'s just a normal thing to have that kind of faith. The fact that He\'s let me stick me around a little longer, or She\'s let me stick around a little longer, certainly goes great with me -- and I want to hang around as long as I\'m healthy and not in anybody\'s way.      I have tried to live my life so that my family would love me and my friends respect me. The others can do whatever the hell they please.      My problem is that I\'m not a handsome man like Cary Grant, who will be handsome at 65. I may be able to do a few more man-woman things before it\'s too late, but then what? I never want to play silly old men chasing young girls, as some of the stars are doing. I have to be a director - I\'ve waited all these years to be one. The Alamo (1960) will tell what my future is.      [on The Green Berets (1968)] When I saw what our boys are going through - hell - and how the morale was holding up, and the job they were doing, I just knew they had to make this picture.      I\'m quite sure that the concept of a government-run reservation would have an ill effect on anyone. But that seems to be what the socialists are working for now - to have everyone cared for from cradle to grave.      This may come as a surprise to you, but I wasn\'t alive when reservations were created - even if I do look that old. I have no idea what the best method of dealing with the Indians in the 1800s would have been. Our forefathers evidently thought they were doing the right thing.      I\'m not going to give you those I-was-a-poor-boy-and-I-pulled-myself-up-by-my-bootstraps-stories, but I\'ve gone without a meal or two in my lifetime, and I still don\'t expect the government to turn over any of its territory to me. Hard times aren\'t something I can blame my fellow citizens for. Years ago, I didn\'t have all the opportunities, either. But you can\'t whine and bellyache \'cause somebody else got a good break and you didn\'t, like these Indians are. We\'ll all be on a reservation soon if the socialists keep subsidizing groups like them with our tax money.      Look, I\'m sure there have been inequalities. If those inequalities are presently affecting any of the Indians now alive, they have a right to a court hearing. But what happened 100 years ago in our country can\'t be blamed on us today.      [asked whether the Native American Indians should be allowed to camp on their land at Alcatraz] Well, I don\'t know of anybody else who wants it. The fellas who were taken off it sure don\'t want to go back there, including the guards. So as far as I am concerned, I think we ought to make a deal with the Indians. They should pay as much for Alcatraz as we paid them for Manhattan. I hope they haven\'t been careless with their wampum.      [on Superman (1978) star Christopher Reeve after meeting him at the 1979 Academy Awards] This is our new man. He\'s taking over.      I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to the point of responsibility. I don\'t believe in giving authority and positions of leadership and judgment to irresponsible people.      Have you ever heard of some fellows who first came over to this country? You know what they found? They found a howling wilderness, with summers too hot and winters freezing, and they also found some unpleasant little characters who painted their faces. Do you think these pioneers filled out form number X6277 and sent in a report saying the Indians were a little unreasonable? Did they have insurance for their old age, for their crops, for their homes? They did not! They looked at the land, and the forest, and the rivers. They looked at their wives, their kids and their houses, and then they looked up at the sky and they said, ""Thanks, God, we\'ll take it from here.""      Don\'t ever for a minute make the mistake of looking down your nose at westerns. They\'re art--the good ones, I mean. They deal in life and sudden death and primitive struggle, and with the basic emotions--love, hate, and anger--thrown in. We\'ll have westerns films as long as the cameras keep turning. The fascination that the Old West has will never die. And as long as people want to pay money to see me act, I\'ll keep on making westerns until the day I die.      If it hadn\'t been for football and the fact I got my leg broke and had to go into the movies to eat, why, who knows, I might have turned out to be a liberal Democrat.      [on why he never wrote an autobiography] Those who like me already know me, and those who don\'t like me wouldn\'t want to read about me anyway.      I don\'t think John Ford had any kind of respect for me as an actor until I made Red River (1948) for Howard Hawks. I was never quite sure what he did think of me as an actor. I know now, though. Because when I finally won an Oscar for my role as Rooster Cogburn in True Grit (1969), Ford shook my hand and said the award was long overdue me as far as he was concerned. Right then, I knew he\'d respected me as an actor since Stagecoach (1939), even though he hadn\'t let me know it. He later told me his praise earlier, might have gone to my head and made me conceited, and that was why he\'d never said anything to me, until the right time.      I play John Wayne in every picture regardless of the character, and I\'ve been doing all right, haven\'t I?      Talk low, talk slow and don\'t talk too much.      That little clique back there in the East has taken great personal satisfaction reviewing my politics instead of my pictures. But one day those doctrinaire liberals will wake up to find the pendulum has swung the other way.      I was 32nd in the box office polls when I accepted the presidency of the Alliance [The Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a right-wing political organization he helped start]. When I left office eight years later, somehow the folks who buy the tickets had made me number one.      [on Frank Capra] I\'d like to take that little Dago son of a bitch and tear him into a million pieces and throw him into the ocean and watch him float back to Sicily where he belongs.      Television has a tendency to reach a little. In their westerns, they are getting away from the simplicity and the fact that those men were fighting the elements and the rawness of nature and didn\'t have time for this couch-work.      Mine is a rebellion against the monotony of life. The rebellion in these kids, particularly the S.D.S.-ers and those groups, seems to be a kind of dissension by rote.      Just think of it. At the Alamo there was a band of only 185 men of many nationalities and religions, all joined in a common cause for freedom. Those 185 men killed 1000 of Santa Anna\'s men before they died. But they knew they spent their lives for the precious time Sam Houston needed.      [on the studios\' blacklisting of alleged ""subversives"" in Hollywood] If it is for the FBI, I will do anything for them. If they want me to I will even be photographed with an agent and point out a Communist for them. Tell Mr. Hoover [FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover] I am on his side.      You know, I hear everybody talking about the generation gap. Frankly, sometimes I don\'t know what they\'re talking about. Heck, by now I should know a little bit about it, if I\'m ever going to. I have seven kids and 18 grandkids and I don\'t seem to have any trouble talking to any of them. Never have had, and I don\'t intend to start now.      [on The Conqueror (1956)] The way the screenplay reads, this is a cowboy picture, and that\'s how I am going to play Genghis Khan. I see him as a gunfighter.      [1979] I\'ve known Jane Fonda since she was a little girl. I\'ve never agreed with a word she\'s said, but would give my life defending her right to say it.      That Redford [Robert Redford] fellow is good. Brando [Marlon Brando]. Ah, Patton (1970) - George C. Scott. But the best of the bunch is Garner - James Garner. He can play anything. Comedy westerns, drama - you name it. Yeah, I have to say Garner is the best around today. He doesn\'t have to say anything just make a face and you crack up.      To me, The Wild Bunch (1969) was distasteful. It would have been a good picture without the gore. Pictures go too far when they use that kind of realism, when they have shots of blood spurting out and teeth flying, and when they throw liver out to make it look like people\'s insides. ""The Wild Bunch"" was one of the first to go that far in realism, and the curious went to see it. That may make the bankers and stock promoters think that it is a necessary ingredient for successful motion pictures. They seem to forget the one basic principle of our business - illusion. We\'re in the business of magic. I don\'t think it hurts a child to see anything that has the illusion of violence in it. All our fairy tales have some kind of violence - the good knight riding to kill the dragon, etc. Why do we have to show the knight spreading the serpent\'s guts all over the candy mountain?      I read someplace that I used to make B-pictures. Hell, they were a lot farther down the alphabet than that . . . but not as far down as R and X. I think any man who makes an X-rated picture ought to be made to take his own daughter to see it.      Screw ambiguity. Perversion and corruption masquerade as ambiguity. I don\'t trust ambiguity.      I\'m not preaching a sermon from the mount, you know. This is just my own opinion. But it does seem to me that when our industry got vulgar and cheap, we began losing our regular customers. Sure, people are curious, and they\'ll go see any provocative thing once - maybe even four or five times - but eventually they\'ll just stay home and watch television. There used to be this little Frenchman in Hollywood who made all these risqué movies . . . what the hell was his name? . . . Lubitsch [Ernst Lubitsch, who was actually German]! He could make pictures as risqué as anything you\'ll see today, but he made them with taste and illusion. The only sadness in my heart for our business is that we are taking all the illusion out of it. After all, it\'s pretty hard to take your daughter to see Deep Throat (1972).      Not that I had thoughts of becoming a song and dance man, but, like most young actors, I did want to play a variety of roles. I remember walking down the street one day, mumbling to myself about the way my career was going, when suddenly I bumped into Will Rogers. ""What\'s the matter, Duke?"" he asked, and I said things weren\'t going so well. ""You working?"" he asked, and I said, ""Yep."" ""Keep working, Duke,"" he said and smiled and walked away.      I think it was sad that Brando [Marlon Brando] did what he did. If he had something to say, he should have appeared that night and stated his views instead of taking some little unknown girl and dressing her up in an Indian outfit. What he was doing was trying to avoid the issue that was really on his mind, which was the provocative story of Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972). Let\'s just say I haven\'t made a particular point of seeing that particular picture. Brando is one of the finest actors we\'ve had in the business, and I\'m only sorry he didn\'t have the benefit of older, more established friends - as I did - to help him choose the proper material in which to use his talent.      Watergate is a sad and tragic incident in our history. They were wrong, dead wrong, those men at Watergate. Men abused power, but the system still works. Men abused money, but the system still works. Men lied and perjured themselves, but the system still works.      It\'s kind of a sad thing when a normal love of country makes you a super patriot. I do think we have a pretty wonderful country, and I thank God that He chose me to live here.      [December 1973] They\'re trying to crucify Nixon [Richard Nixon], but when they\'re writing the history of this period, Watergate will be no more than a footnote. Believe me, I have a high respect for the bulldogged way in which our President has been able to continue to administrate this government, in spite of the articulate liberal press - whose only purpose is to sell toilet paper and Toyotas - and in spite of the ambitious politicians who would deny him the help and encouragement that a man needs to face the problems of this country. I endorsed Spiro Agnew\'s attitudes, but I knew nothing of his private affairs. I was sadly disappointed to discover his feet of clay.      The only way to get 520,000 men home - men who had been practically sneaked into Vietnam in the first place - was to make the decision to mine Haiphong Harbor. President [Richard Nixon] had the courage to make that decision, and when the other side started using prisoners of war as pawns, he had to make the awesome decision to bomb Hanoi. Which he did, and then he brought our prisoners of war home. Richard Nixon and I have had a long acquaintance. I respected him as a goodly man - winning or losing over the years, and I think he should be standing in the crowningglory today for his accomplishments. Instead, they\'ve chosen to blame him for the gradual growth of hypocrisy and individual ambition that have made our political system distasteful to the public.      [on his separation from third wife Pilar Wayne in 1973] We have separated, and it\'s a sad incident in my life. It is family and personal. I\'d rather keep it that way.      [1973] My build-up was done through constant exposure. By the time I went overseas to visit our boys during the Second World War, they had already seen my movies when they were back home. Now their kids are grown up and their kids are seeing my movies. I\'m part of the family . . . I think Steve McQueen and Robert Redford have a chance of becoming lasting stars. And certainly that big kid - what the hell\'s his name? Jesus, I have such a hard time remembering my own name sometimes. Oh, you know the one I mean, that big kid, the one that\'s been directing some of his own movies lately. Yeah, that\'s the one - Clint Eastwood!      Once I was working in a movie with Harry Carey and his wife Olive [Olive Carey], and I was complaining about being typed. ""Duke,"" Ollie said, ""look at Harry over there - would you like to see Harry Carey play any other way?"". ""Of course not,"" I said. ""Well,"" Ollie said, ""the American public doesn\'t want to see you any other way, either. So wake up, Duke! Be what they want you to be."" See, I\'m not against Women\'s Lib. Ollie gave me some real good advice.John Ford was like a father to me, like a big brother. I got word that he wanted to see me at his home in Palm Springs, and when I got there, he said, ""Hi Duke, down for the deathwatch?"" ""Hell no,"" I said, ""you\'ll bury us all."" But he looked so weak. We used to be a triumvirate - Ford and me and a guy named Ward Bond. The day I went to Palm Springs, Ford said, ""Duke, do you ever think of Ward?"" ""All the time,"" I said. ""Well, let\'s have a drink to Ward,"" he said. So I got out the brandy, gave him a sip and took one for myself. ""All right, Duke,"" he said finally, ""I think I\'ll rest for a while."" I went home, and that was Pappy Ford\'s last day.      [1973] I\'ve been allowed a few more years - I hope. My lung capacity is naturally limited now, but I had a pretty good set before the disease hit me, so it isn\'t too noticeable in my everyday life.      [After failing to win the Best Actor Oscar for Sands of Iwo Jima (1949)] The best way to survive an Oscar is to never try to win another one. You\'ve seen what happens to some Oscar winners. They spend the rest of their lives turning down scripts while searching for the great role to win another one. Hell, I hope I\'m never even nominated again. It\'s meat-and-potato roles for me from now on.      [on The Alamo (1960)] This picture is America. I hope that seeing the battle of the Alamo will remind Americans that liberty and freedom don\'t come cheap. This picture, well, I guess making it has made me feel useful to my country.      [1960] I suddenly found out after 25 years I was starting out all over again. I would just about break even if I sold everything right now.      [12/29/64] I\'ve had lung cancer, the big C. But I\'ve beaten the son of a bitch. Maybe I can give some poor bastard a little hope by being honest. I want people to know cancer can be licked. My advisers all told me that the public doesn\'t want its movie heroes associated with serious illness like cancer, that it destroys their image. Well, I don\'t care much about images, and, anyway, I would have thought there was a lot better image in the fact that John Wayne had cancer and licked it.      [1966] I drink for comradeship, and when I drink for comradeship, I don\'t bother to keep count.      [1962] I\'m a progressive thinker, even though I\'m not in the liberal strain.      [1971] Get a checkup. Talk someone you like into getting a checkup. Nag someone you love into getting a checkup. And while you\'re at it, send a check to the American Cancer Society. It\'s great to be alive.      [1971] Well, you like . . . each picture for . . . a different reason. But I think my favorite will always be the next one.      [on television] I don\'t know if I love it or hate it, but there sure has never been any form of entertainment so . . . so . . . available to the human race with so little effort since they invented marital sex.      [1976] And to all you folks out there, I want to thank you for the last fifty years of my career. And I hope I can keep at it another fifty years - or at least until I can get it right.      [1979] Listen, I spoke to the man up there on many occasions and I have what I always had: deep faith that there is a Supreme Being. There has to be, you know; it\'s just to me, that\'s just a normal thing, to have that kind of faith. The fact that He\'s let me stick around a little longer certainly goes great with me, and I want to hang around as long as I\'m healthy and not in anybody\'s way.      [6/78] I\'m a greedy old man. Life\'s been good to me, and I want some more of it.      Sure I wave the American flag. Do you know a better flag to wave? Sure I love my country with all her faults. I\'m not ashamed of that, never have been, never will be. I was proud when President Nixon [Richard Nixon] ordered the mining of Haiphong Harbor, which we should have done long ago, because I think we\'re helping a brave little country defend herself against Communist invasion. That\'s what I tried to show in The Green Berets (1968) and I took plenty of abuse from the critics. Did you ever see reviews like that? Reviews with hatred and nastiness.      [his speech at The 42nd Annual Academy Awards (1970)] Wow! Ladies and gentlemen, I\'m no stranger to this podium. I\'ve come up here and picked up these beautiful golden men before, but always for friends. One night I picked up two: one for Admiral John Ford and one for our beloved Gary Cooper. I was very clever and witty that night - the envy of, even, Bob Hope. But tonight I don\'t feel very clever, very witty. I feel very grateful, very humble, and I owe thanks to many, many people. I want to thank the members of the Academy. To all you people who are watching on television, thank you for taking such warm interest in our glorious industry. Good night.      When you come slam bang up against trouble, it never looks half as bad if you face up to it.      A man\'s got to have a code, a creed to live by, no matter his job.      When the road looks rough ahead, remember the Man Upstairs and the word ""Hope"". Hang onto both and tough it out.      We\'ve made mistakes along the way, but that\'s no reason to start tearing up the best flag God ever gave to any country.      [on his third wife Pilar Wayne] I can tell you why I love her. I have a lust for her dignity. I look at her wonderfully classic face, and I see hidden in it a sense of humor that I love. I think of wonderful, exciting, decent things when I look at her.      The West - the very words go straight to that place of the heart where Americans feel the spirit of pride in their western heritage - the triumph of personal courage over any obstacle, whether nature or man.      There\'s a lot of yella bastards in the country who would like to call patriotism old-fashioned. With all that leftist activity, I was quite obviously on the other side. I was invited at first to a coupla cell meetings, and I played the lamb to listen to \'em for a while. The only guy that ever fooled me was the director Edward Dmytryk. I made a picture with him called Back to Bataan (1945). He started talking about the masses, and as soon as he started using that word - which is from their book, not ours - I knew he was a Commie.END.      My main object in making a motion picture is entertainment. If at the same time I can strike a blow for liberty, then I\'ll stick one in.      I think those blacklisted people should have been sent over to Russia. They\'d have been taken care of over there, and if the Commies ever won over here, why hell, those guys would be the first ones they\'d take care of - after me.      I said there was a tall, lanky kid that led 150 airplanes across Berlin. He was an actor, but that day, I said, he was a colonel. Colonel Jimmy Stewart [James Stewart]. So I said, ""What is all this crap about Reagan [Ronald Reagan] being an actor?""The Green Berets (1968) made $7,000,000 in the first three months of its release. This so-called intellectual group aren\'t in touch with the American people, regardless of [J. William Fulbright\'s] blatting, and Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern and Ted Kennedy. In spite of them the American people do not feel that way. Instead of taking a census, they ought to count the tickets that were sold to that picture.      In spite of the fact that Rooster Cogburn would shoot a fella between the eyes, he\'d judge that fella before he did it. He was merely trying to make the area in which he was marshal livable for the most number of people.      I wrote to the head man at General Motors and said, ""I\'m gonna have to desert you if you don\'t stop making cars for women.\'""Paul Newman would have been a much more important star if he hadn\'t always tried to be an anti-hero, to show the human feet of clay.      Contrary to what people think, I\'m no politician, and when I have something to say I say it through my movies.      [on Donovan\'s Reef (1963)] The script really called for a younger guy. I felt awkward romancing a young girl at my age.      [on Jet Pilot (1957)] It is undoubtedly one of my worst movies ever.      [on Cahill U.S. Marshal (1973)] It just wasn\'t a well done picture. It needed better writing, it needed a little better care in making.      I had the feeling my career was going to decline back in \'68. I\'d just had a big hit with The Green Berets (1968), but I wasn\'t getting any younger and I knew Hellfighters (1968) wasn\'t going to set the box office on fire. Then I read a script for a film called True Grit (1969).      [on High Plains Drifter (1973)] That isn\'t what the West was all about. That isn\'t the American people who settled this country.      [on Raoul Walsh] I\'ve been very lucky in the men I\'ve worked with. Raoul Walsh -- the heartiness and lustiness he gave to pictures I thought was tremendous.      [on They Came to Cordura (1959)] How they got Gary Cooper to do that one! To me, at least, it simply degrades the Medal of Honor. The whole story makes a mockery of America\'s highest award for valor. The whole premise of the story was wrong, illogical, because they don\'t pick the type of men the movie picked to win the award, and that can be proved by the very history of the award.      [on Republic Pictures\' chief Herbert J. Yates\' failed attempts to make a star out of wife Vera Ralston] Yates was one of the smartest businessmen I ever met. I respected him in many ways, and he liked me. But when it came to the woman he loved, his business brains just went flyin\' out the window.      [on The Fighting Kentuckian (1949)] Yates [Republic Pictures studio chief Herbert J. Yates] made me use Vera Hruba [Republic star Vera Ralston, who was also Yates\' mistress] . . . I\'ve always been mad at Yates about this, because we lost the chance to have one damn fine movie.      I know what the critics think--that I can\'t act. What is a great actor anyway? Of course, you could say a great actor is one who can play many different parts, like [Laurence Olivier] can. But all the parts I play are tailor-made for me.      [on reactions to The Green Berets (1968)] The left-wingers are shredding my flesh, but like Liberace, we\'re bawling all the way to the bank.      [about the death of James Stewart\'s son, who was killed in Vietnam] Jesus, that was a terrible thing about Gloria and Jimmy Stewart\'s kid getting killed over there. It makes you want to cry. At least Jimmy was over there to see the kid a few months ago. That\'s something. But it makes you want to cry. And [Robert Taylor]\'s going was terrible. He was terminal since they opened him up. I know what he went through. They ripped a lung out of me. I thank God I\'m still here. All the real motion picture people have always made family pictures. But the downbeats and the so-called intelligentsia got in when the government stupidly split up the production companies and the theaters. The old giants--[Louis B. Mayer], [Irving Thalberg], even Harry Cohn, despite the fact that personally I couldn\'t stand him--were good for this industry. Now the goddamned stock manipulators have taken over. They don\'t know a goddamned thing about making movies. They make something dirty, and it makes money, and they say, ""Jesus, let\'s make one a little dirtier, maybe it\'ll make more money"". And now even the bankers are getting their noses into it. I\'ll give you an example. Take that girl, Julie Andrews, a refreshing, openhearted girl, a wonderful performer. Her stint was Mary Poppins (1964) and The Sound of Music (1965). But she wanted to be a Theda Bara. And they went along with her, and the picture fell flat on its ass. A [Samuel Goldwyn] would have told her, ""Look, my dear, you can\'t change your sweet and lovely image"".      But you know, I\'m very conscious that people criticize Hollywood. Yet we\'ve created a form, the Western, that can be understood in every country. The good guys against the bad guys. No nuances. And the horse is the best vehicle of action in our medium. You take action, a scene, and scenery, and cut them together, and you never miss. Action, scene, scenery. But when you think about the Western--ones I\'ve made, for example. Stagecoach (1939), Red River (1948), The Searchers (1956), a picture named Hondo (1953) that had a little depth to it--it\'s an American art form. It represents what this country is about. In True Grit (1969), for example, that scene where Rooster shoots the rat. That was a kind of reference to today\'s problems. Oh, not that ""True Grit"" has a message or anything. But that scene was about less accommodation, and more justice. They keep bringing up the fact that America\'s for the downtrodden. But this new thing of genuflecting to the downtrodden, I don\'t go along with that. We ought to go back to praising the kids who get good grades, instead of making excuses for the ones who shoot the neighborhood grocery man. But, hell, I don\'t want to get started on that!      But back to True Grit (1969). Henry Hathaway used the backgrounds in such a way that it became almost a fantasy. Remember that one scene, where old Rooster is facing those four men across the meadow, and he takes the reins in his teeth and charges? Fill your hands, you varmints! That\'s Henry at work. It\'s a real meadow, but it looks almost dreamlike. Henry made it a fantasy and yet he kept it an honest Western. You get something of that in the character of Rooster. Well, they say he\'s not like what I\'ve done before, and I even say that, but he does have facets of the John Wayne character, huh? I think he does. Of course, they give me that John Wayne stuff so much, claim I always play the same role. Seems like nobody remembers how different the fellas were in The Quiet Man (1952). Or Sands of Iwo Jima (1949). Or She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), where I was 35 playing a man of 65. To stay a star, you have to bring along some of your own personality. Thousands of good actors can carry a scene, but a star has to carry the scene and still, without intruding, allow some of his character into it.      [on True Grit (1969)] And that ending. I liked that. You know, in the book Mattie loses her hand from the snakebite, and I die, and the last scene in the book has her looking at my grave. But the way Marguerite Roberts wrote the screenplay, she gave it an uplift. Mattie and Rooster both go to visit her family plot, after she gets cured of the snakebite. By now it\'s winter. And she offers to let Rooster be buried there some day, seeing as how he has no family of his own. Rooster\'s happy to accept, long as he doesn\'t have to take her up on it too quick. So then he gets on his horse and says, ""Come and see a fat old man sometime"". And then he spurs the horse and jumps a fence, just to show he still can.      [in 1973] Hell yes, I\'m a liberal. I listen to both sides before I make up my mind. Doesn\'t that make you a liberal? Not in today\'s terms, it doesn\'t. These days, you have to be a fucking left-wing radical to be a liberal. Politically, though . . . I\'ve mellowed.      I\'m glad I won\'t be around much longer to see what they do with it. The men who control the big studios today are stock manipulators and bankers. They know nothing about our business. They\'re in it for the buck. The only thing they can do is say, ""Jeez, that picture with what\'s-her-name running around the park naked made money, so let\'s make another one. If that\'s what they want, let\'s give it to them."" Some of these guys remind me of high-class whores. Look at 20th Century-Fox, where they\'re making movies like Myra Breckinridge (1970). Why doesn\'t that son of a bitch Darryl F. Zanuck get himself a striped silk shirt and learn how to play the piano? Then he could work in any room in the house. As much as I couldn\'t stand some of the old-time moguls - especially Harry Cohn - these men took an interest in the future of their business. They had integrity. There was a stretch when they realized that they\'d made a hero out of the goddamn gangster heavy in crime movies, that they were doing a discredit to our country. So the moguls voluntarily took it upon themselves to stop making gangster pictures. No censorship from the outside. They were responsible to the public. But today\'s executives don\'t give a damn. In their efforts to grab the box office that these sex pictures are attracting, they\'re producing garbage. They\'re taking advantage of the fact that nobody wants to be called a bluenose. But they\'re going to reach the point where the American people will say, ""The hell with this!"" And once they do, we\'ll have censorship in every state, in every city, and there\'ll be no way you can make even a worthwhile picture for adults and have it acceptable for national release.      Every time they rate a picture, they let a little more go. Ratings are ridiculous to begin with. There was no need for rated pictures when the major studios were in control. Movies were once made for the whole family. Now, with the kind of junk the studios are cranking out-and the jacked-up prices they\'re charging for the privilege of seeing it - the average family is staying home and watching television. I\'m quite sure that within two or three years, Americans will be completely fed up with these perverted films.      But don\'t get me wrong. As far as a man and a woman is concerned, I\'m awfully happy there\'s a thing called sex. It\'s an extra something God gave us. I see no reason why it shouldn\'t be in pictures. Healthy, lusty sex is wonderful.      When you get hairy, sweaty bodies in the foreground, it becomes distasteful, unless you use a pretty heavy gauze. I can remember seeing pictures that Ernst Lubitsch made in the \'30s that were beautifully risqué--and you\'d certainly send your children to see them. They were done with intimation. They got over everything these other pictures do without showing the hair and the sweat. When you think of the wonderful picture fare we\'ve had through the years and realize we\'ve come to this shit, it\'s disgusting. If they want to continue making those pictures, fine. But my career will have ended. I\'ve already reached a pretty good height right now in a business that I feel is going to fade out from its own vulgarity.      Perhaps we have run out of imagination on how to effect illusion because of the satiating realism of a real war on television. But haven\'t we got enough of that in real life? Why can\'t the same point be made just as effectively in a drama without all the gore? The violence in my pictures, for example, is lusty and a little bit humorous, because I believe humor nullifies violence. Like in one picture, directed by Henry Hathaway [The Sons of Katie Elder (1965)], this heavy was sticking a guy\'s head in a barrel of water. I\'m watching this and I don\'t like it one bit, so I pick up this pick handle and I yell, ""Hey!"" and clock him across the head. Down he went--with no spurting blood. Well, that got a hell of a laugh because of the way I did it. That\'s my kind of violence.      [on True Grit (1969)] In my other pictures, we\'ve had an explosion or something go off when a bad word was said. This time we didn\'t. It\'s profanity, all right, but I doubt if there\'s anybody in the United States who hasn\'t heard the expression ""son of a bitch"" or ""bastard"". We felt it was acceptable in this instance. At the emotional high point in that particular picture, I felt it was OK to use it. It would have been pretty hard to say ""you illegitimate sons of so-and-so!"".      Rooster Cogburn\'s attitude toward life was maybe a little different, but he was basically the same character I\'ve always played.      They made me a singing cowboy. The fact that I couldn\'t sing--or play the guitar--became terribly embarrassing to me, especially on personal appearances. Every time I made a public appearance, the kids insisted that I sing ""The Desert Song"" or something. But I couldn\'t take along the fella who played the guitar out on one side of the camera and the fella who sang on the other side of the camera. So finally I went to the head of the studio and said. ""Screw this, I can\'t handle it."" And I quit doing those kind of pictures. They went out and brought the best hillbilly recording artist in the country to Hollywood to take my place. For the first couple of pictures, they had a hard time selling him, but he finally caught on. His name was Gene Autry. It was 1939 before I made Stagecoach (1939)--the picture that really made me a star.Rio Lobo (1970) certainly wasn\'t any different from most of my Westerns. Nor was Chisum (1970), the one before that. But there still seems to be a very hearty public appetite for this kind of film--what some writers call a typical John Wayne Western. That\'s a label they use disparagingly . . . If I depended on the critics\' judgment and recognition, I\'d never have gone into the motion-picture business.      Sure it did--even if it took the industry 40 years to get around to it [awarding him an Oscar]. But I think both of my two previous Oscar nominations--for She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and Sands of Iwo Jima (1949)--were worthy of the honor. I know the Marines and all the American armed forces were quite proud of my portrayal of Stryker, the Marine sergeant in ""Iwo"". At an American Legion convention in Florida, General Douglas MacArthur told me, ""You represent the American serviceman better than the American serviceman himself."" And, at 42, in ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" I played the same character that I played in True Grit (1969) at 62. But I really didn\'t need an Oscar. I\'m a box-office champion with a record they\'re going to have to run to catch. And they won\'t.      Let\'s say I hope that I appeal to the more carefree times in a person\'s life rather than to his reasoning adulthood. I\'d just like to be an image that reminds someone of joy rather than of the problems of the world.      Luckily so far, it seems they kind of consider me an older friend, somebody believable and down-to-earth. I\'ve avoided being mean or petty, but I\'ve never avoided being rough or tough. I\'ve only played one cautious part in my life, in Allegheny Uprising (1939). My parts have ranged from that rather dull character to Ralls in Wake of the Red Witch (1948), who was a nice enough fella sober, but bestial when he was drunk, and certainly a rebel. I was also a rebel in Reap the Wild Wind (1942) with Cecil B. DeMille. I\'ve played many parts in which I\'ve rebelled against something in society. I was never much of a joiner. Kids do join things, but they also like to consider themselves individuals capable of thinking for themselves. So do I.      Entertainers like Steve Allen and his cronies who went up to Northern California and held placards to save the life of that guy Caryl Chessman. I just don\'t understand these things. I can\'t understand why our national leadership isn\'t willing to take the responsibility of leadership instead of checking polls and listening to the few that scream. Why are we allowing ourselves to become a mobocracy instead of a democracy? When you allow unlawful acts to go unpunished, you\'re moving toward a government of men rather than a government of law; you\'re moving toward anarchy. And that\'s exactly what we\'re doing. We allow dirty loudmouths to publicly call policemen pigs; we let a fella like William Kunstler make a speech to the Black Panthers saying that the ghetto is theirs, and that if police come into it, they have a right to shoot them. Why is that dirty, no-good son of a bitch allowed to practice law?      Quite obviously, the Black Panthers represent a danger to society. They\'re a violent group of young men and women - adventurous, opinionated and dedicated - and they throw their disdain in our face. Now, I hear some of these liberals saying they\'d like to be held as white hostages in the Black Panther offices and stay there so that they could see what happens on these early-morning police raids. It might be a better idea for these good citizens to go with the police on a raid. When they search a Panther hideout for firearms, let these do-gooders knock and say, ""Open the door in the name of the law"" and get shot at.      They\'re standing up for what they feel is right, not for what they think is right--\'cause they don\'t think. As a kid, the Panther ideas probably would have intrigued me. When I was a little kid, you could be adventurous like that without hurting anybody. There were periods when you could blow the valve and let off some steam. Like Halloween. You\'d talk about it for three months ahead of time, and then that night you\'d go out and stick the hose in the lawn, turn it on and start singing ""Old Black Joe"" or something. And when people came out from their Halloween party, you\'d lift the hose and wet them down. And while you were running, the other kids would be stealing the ice cream from the party. All kinds of rebellious actions like that were accepted for that one day. Then you could talk about it for three months afterward. That took care of about six months of the year. There was another day called the Fourth of July, when you could go out and shoot firecrackers and burn down two or three buildings. So there were two days a year. Now those days are gone. You can\'t have firecrackers, you can\'t have explosives, you can\'t have this, don\'t do this, don\'t do that. Don\'t . . . don\'t . . . don\'t. A continual ""don\'t"" until the kids are ready to do almost anything rebellious. The government makes the rules, so now the running of our government is the thing they\'re rebelling against. For a lot of those kids, that\'s just being adventurous. They\'re not deliberately setting out to undermine the foundations of our great country. They\'re doing their level worst--without knowing it. How \'bout all the kids that were at the Chicago Democratic Convention? They were conned into doing hysterical things by a bunch of activists. A lot of Communist-activated people. I know Communism\'s a horrible word to some people. They laugh and say, ""He\'ll be finding them under his bed tomorrow."" But perhaps that\'s because their kid hasn\'t been inculcated yet. Dr. Herbert Marcuse, the political philosopher at the University of California at San Diego, who is quite obviously a Marxist, put it very succinctly when he said, ""We will use the anarchists.""      [Herbert Marcuse] has become a hero only for an articulate clique. The men that give me faith in my country are fellas like Spiro Agnew, not the Marcuses. They\'ve attempted in every way to humiliate Agnew. They\'ve tried the old Rooseveltian thing of trying to laugh him out of political value of his party. Every comedian\'s taken a crack at him. But I bet if you took a poll today, he\'d probably be one of the most popular men in the United States. Nobody likes Spiro Agnew but the people. Yet he and other responsible government leaders are booed and pelted when they speak on college campuses.      Well, when I went to USC, if anybody had gone into the president\'s office and shit in his wastepaper basket and used the dirt to write vulgar words on the wall, not only the football team but the average kid on campus would have gone to work on the guy. There doesn\'t seem to be respect for authority anymore; these student dissenters act like children who have to have their own way on everything. They\'re immature and living in a little world all their own. Just like hippie dropouts, they\'re afraid to face the real competitive world.      I figure if we\'re going to send even one man to die, we ought to be in an all-out conflict. If you fight, you fight to win. And the domino theory is something to be reckoned with, too, both in Europe and in Asia. Look at what happened in Czechoslovakia and what\'s happened all through the Balkans. At some point we have to stop communism. So we might as well stop it right now in Vietnam.      Many of us were being invited to supposed social functions or house parties--usually at well-known Hollywood writers\' homes--that turned out to be Communist recruitment meetings. Suddenly, everybody from makeup men to stagehands found themselves in seminars on Marxism. Take this colonel I knew, the last man to leave the Philippines on a submarine in 1942. He came back here and went to work sending food and gifts to U.S. prisoners on Bataan. He\'d already gotten a Dutch ship that was going to take all this stuff over. The State Department pulled him off of it and sent the poor bastard out to be the technical director on my picture Back to Bataan (1945), which was being made by Edward Dmytryk. I knew that he and a whole group of actors in the picture were pro-Reds, and when I wasn\'t there, these pro-Reds went to work on the colonel. He was a Catholic, so they kidded him about his religion: They even sang ""The Internationale"" at lunchtime. He finally came to me and said, ""Mr. Wayne, I haven\'t anybody to turn to. These people are doing everything in their power to belittle me."" So I went to Dmytryk and said, ""Hey, are you a Commie?"" He said, ""No, I\'m not a Commie. My father was a Russian. I was born in Canada. But if the masses of the American people want communism, I think it\'d be good for our country."" When he used the word ""masses,"" he exposed himself. That word is not a part of Western terminology. So I knew he was a Commie. Well, it later came out that he was. I also knew two other fellas who really did things that were detrimental to our way of life. One of them was Carl Foreman, the guy who wrote the screenplay for High Noon (1952), and the other was Robert Rossen, the one who made the picture about Huey Long, All the King\'s Men (1949). In Rossen\'s version of ""All the King\'s Men"", which he sent me to read for a part, every character who had any responsibility at all was guilty of some offense against society. To make Huey Long a wonderful, rough pirate was great; but, according to this picture, everybody was a shit except for this weakling intern doctor who was trying to find a place in the world. I sent the script back to Charles Feldman, my agent, and said, ""If you ever send me a script like this again, I\'ll fire you."" Ironically, it won the Academy Award. ""High Noon"" was even worse. Everybody says ""High Noon"" is a great picture because Dimitri Tiomkin wrote some great music for it and because Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly were in it. So it\'s got everything going for it. In that picture, four guys come in to gun down the sheriff. He goes to the church and asks for help and the guys go, ""Oh well, oh gee."" And the women stand up and say, ""You\'re rats. You\'re rats. You\'re rats."" So Cooper goes out alone. It\'s the most un-American thing I\'ve ever seen in my whole life. The last thing in the picture is ole Coop putting the United States marshal\'s badge under his foot and stepping on it. I\'ll never regret having helped run Foreman out of this country. Running him out of the country is just a figure of speech. But I did tell him that I thought he\'d hurt Gary Cooper\'s reputation a great deal. Foreman said, ""Well, what if I went to England?"" I said, ""Well, that\'s your business."" He said, ""Well, that\'s where I\'m going."" And he did.      I\'ve always followed my father\'s advice: He told me, first, to always keep my word and, second, to never insult anybody unintentionally. If I insult you, you can be goddamn sure I intend to. And, third, he told me not to go around looking for trouble. Well, I guess I have had some problems sticking to that third rule, but I\'d say I\'ve done pretty damn well with the first and second. I try to have good enough taste to insult only those I wish to insult. I\'ve worked in a business where it\'s almost a requirement to break your word if you want to survive, but whenever I signed a contract for five years or for a certain amount of money, I\'ve always lived up to it. I figured that if I was silly enough to sign it, or if I thought it was worth while at the time, that\'s the way she goes. I\'m not saying that I won\'t drive as hard a bargain as I can. In fact, I think more about that end of the business than I did before, ever since 1959, when I found that my business manager was playing more than he was working. I didn\'t know how bad my financial condition was until my lawyer and everybody else said, ""Let\'s all have a meeting and figure out exactly where you stand."" At the conclusion of that meeting, it was quite obvious that I wasn\'t in anywhere near the shape that I thought I was or ought to be after twenty-five years of hard work. If they\'d given me the time to sell everything without taking a quick loss, I would have come out about even. Oil and everything else. Not enough constructive thinking had been done. Then there was the shrimp fiasco. One of my dearest friends was Robert Arias, who was married to the ballerina Dame Margot Fonteyn. While his brother Tony was alive, we had control of about seventy per cent of the shrimp in Panama. We were also buying some island property near the Panama Canal. We were going to put in a ship-repair place. There were tugs standing down there at $150 a day to drag ships back up to the United States, because repair prices in the Canal Zone were so high. But our plans fell through when Tony was killed in an airplane accident. Around a half a million dollars was lost. If anything happened to me now, I have the right amount of insurance. I hope and pray, for my estate. I\'m about as big a rancher as there is in Arizona, so I have outside interests other than my motion-picture work. The turning point was the moment I decided to watch what was being done with my money.      I had two operations six days apart - one for a cancer that was as big as a baby\'s fist, and then one for edema. I wasn\'t so uptight when I was told about the cancer. My biggest fear came when they twisted my windpipe and had to sew me back together a second time. When my family came in to see me and I saw the looks on their faces, I figured, ""Well, Jeez, I must be just about all through. I kept my spirits up by thinking about God and my family and my friends and telling myself, ""Everything will be all right."" And it was. I licked the Big C. I know the man upstairs will pull the plug when he wants to, but I don\'t want to end up my life being sick. I want to go out on two feet - in action. The operation hasn\'t impeded anything except that I get short of breath quickly. Particularly in the higher altitudes, that slows me down. I still do my own fights and all that stuff. I\'d probably do a little bit more if I had more wind, but I still do more than my share. Nobody else does anything any more than I do, whether they\'re young or old.      I don\'t have to assert my virility. I think my career has shown that I\'m not exactly a pantywaist. But I do take pride in my work, even to the point of being the first one on the set in the morning. I\'m a professional.      What the hell, in my racket I\'ve fallen off a lot of horses. I even fell off on purpose in True Grit (1969). But that fall in The Undefeated (1969) was irritating because I tore some ligaments in my shoulder. I don\'t have good use of one arm anymore, and it makes me look like an idiot when I\'m getting on a horse.      There\'s been no top authority saying what marijuana does to you. I really don\'t know that much about it. I tried it once, but it didn\'t do anything to me. The kids say it makes them think they\'re going thirty miles an hour when they\'re going eighty. If that\'s true, marijuana use should definitely be stopped. When I went to Hong Kong, I tried opium once, as a clinical thing. I heard it didn\'t make you sick the first time, and Jesus, it just didn\'t affect me one way or the other, either. So I\'m not a very good judge of how debasing it is.      Well, at one time in my career, I guess sexuality was part of my appeal. But God, I\'m 63 years old now. How the hell do I know whether I still convey that? Jeez. It\'s pretty hard to answer a question like, ""Are you attractive to broads?"" All that crap comes from the way I walk, I guess. There\'s evidently a virility in it. Otherwise, why do they keep mentioning it? But I\'m certainly not conscious of any particular walk. I guess I must walk different than other people, but I haven\'t gone to any school to learn how.      If a guy wants to wear his hair down to his ass, I\'m not revolted by it. But I don\'t look at him and say, ""Now there\'s a fella I\'d like to spend next winter with.""Winston Churchill\'s the most terrific fella of our century. If I had to make a speech on the subject of Communism, I could think of nobody that had a better insight or that said things concerning the future that have proven out so well. Let me read to you from a book of his quotes. While [Franklin D. Roosevelt] was giving the world Communism, Churchill said, ""I tell you--it\'s no use arguing with a Communist. It\'s no good trying to convert a Communist, or persuade him. You can only deal with them on the following basis . . . you can only do it by having superior force on your side on the matter in question--and they must also be convinced that you will use--you will not hesitate to use these forces if necessary, in the most ruthless manner. You have not only to convince the Soviet government that you have superior force--but that you are not restrained by any moral consideration if the case arose from using that force with complete material ruthlessness. And that is the greatest chance of peace, the surest road to peace. Churchill was unparalleled. Above all, he took a nearly beaten nation and kept their dignity for them.      If I had it to do over again, I\'d probably do everything I did. But that\'s not necessarily the right thing to do.      You\'re going to think I\'m being corny, but this is how I really feel: I hope my family and my friends will be able to say that I was an honest, kind and fairly decent man.      [About his close friend Maureen O\'Hara] There\'s only one woman who has been my friend over the years and by that I mean a real friend, like a man would be. That woman is Maureen O\'Hara. She\'s big, lusty, and absolutely marvelous, definitely my kind of woman. She\'s a great guy. I\'ve had many friends and I prefer the company of men. Except for Maureen O\'Hara.      [on Maureen O\'Hara] She is a woman who speaks her mind and that impressed me, despite my old-fashioned chauvinistic ways! She is feminine and beautiful, but there is something about her that makes her more like a man. It\'s her stubbornness and her willingness to stand up to anyone--even John Ford.      [April 1944, on Victory Committee USO tour] What go me was the way those kids out there kept their sense of humor. Through hard work, battle, or deadly monotony, they could laugh. Healthy beefing, sure, but no squawks. Taking it, day after day, and no complaining. It got me.      [1/46, interview in ""Screenland"" magazine] The picture business has grown up since I got into it 15 years ago, has acquired a dignity that is beyond reproach. Hollywood is, today, a quiet town compared to other places I have been and can, moreover, be pretty proud of itself, having pushed more charities, given more time to selling war bonds and more talent to entertaining servicemen than any other town in any other part of the country.      In B-pictures all we ever did is tell a story. He\'s gone to Red Gap! Where\'s Red Gap? There\'s Red Gap! Let\'s git after him to Red Gap. Here\'s Red Gap! But in A-pictures you reacted more to the situations.      You may think all my parts are the same. That\'s just what I want you to think. You get lost on the screen if your personality doesn\'t show through.      Couches are for one thing only.      Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. It comes into us at midnight very clean. It\'s perfect when it arrives and puts itself in our hands. It hopes we\'ve learned something from yesterday.      [in 1971] I licked the Big C. I know the man upstairs will pull the plug when he wants to, but I don\'t want to end my life being sick. I want to go out on two feet--in action.      [in 1971] Republic Pictures gave me a screen credit on one of the early pictures and called me Michael Burns. On another one they called me Duke Morrison. Then they decided Duke Morrison didn\'t have enough prestige. My real name, Marion Michael Morrison, didn\'t sound American enough for them. So they came up with John Wayne. I didn\'t have any say in it, but I think it\'s a great name. It\'s short and strong and to the point. It took me a long time to get used to it, though. I still don\'t recognize it when somebody calls me John . . .      [At his divorce trial in 1953] I deeply regret I\'m going to have to sling mud.      (On Howard Hawks) ""Oh, yeah, Hawks and I had a few fights along the way,"" Wayne said, ""but he accepted me as an expert, which I was, and we did not have any more trouble, and I was always happy to work for Hawks.""      The guy you see on the screen really isn\'t me. I\'m Duke Morrison and I never was and never will be a film personality like John Wayne. I know him well. I\'m one of his closest students. I have to be. I make a living out of him.Salary (50)Bardelys the Magnificent\xa0(1926)      $10 /day      The Big Trail\xa0(1930)      $75 /week      Three Girls Lost\xa0(1931)      $200 /week      The Deceiver\xa0(1931)      $350 /week      The Range Feud\xa0(1931)      $350 /week      Maker of Men\xa0(1931)      $350 /week      The Voice of Hollywood No. 13 (Second Series)\xa0(1932)      $200       The Shadow of the Eagle\xa0(1932)      $675       Texas Cyclone\xa0(1932)      $350 /week      Two-Fisted Law\xa0(1932)      $350 /week      The Hurricane Express\xa0(1932)      $675       Ride Him, Cowboy\xa0(1932)      $1,500       The Big Stampede\xa0(1932)      $1,500       Haunted Gold\xa0(1932)      $1,500       The Telegraph Trail\xa0(1933)      $1,500       The Three Musketeers\xa0(1933)      $500       Somewhere in Sonora\xa0(1933)      $1,500       The Life of Jimmy Dolan\xa0(1933)      $1,500       His Private Secretary\xa0(1933)      $150 per week      Baby Face\xa0(1933)      $1,500       The Man from Monterey\xa0(1933)      $1,500       Westward Ho\xa0(1935)      $6,000       Sea Spoilers\xa0(1936)      $6,000       California Straight Ahead!\xa0(1937)      $6,000       I Cover the War!\xa0(1937)      $6,000       Idol of the Crowds\xa0(1937)      $6,000       Adventure\'s End\xa0(1937)      $6,000       Stagecoach\xa0(1939)      $3,700       Reap the Wild Wind\xa0(1942)      $25,000       Without Reservations\xa0(1946)      $68,000       Fort Apache\xa0(1948)      $110,000       Red River\xa0(1948)      $75,000 + percentage of gross      Wake of the Red Witch\xa0(1948)      $75,000 + 10% of gross      Sands of Iwo Jima\xa0(1949)      $180,000 + 10% of gross      Flying Leathernecks\xa0(1951)      $300,000       The Barbarian and the Geisha\xa0(1958)      $700,000       Rio Bravo\xa0(1959)      $750,000       The Horse Soldiers\xa0(1959)      $750,000       The Horse Soldiers\xa0(1959)      $500,000       The Horse Soldiers\xa0(1959)      $750,000 + 20% of the gross      North to Alaska\xa0(1960)      $750,000 + 10% of gross      The Comancheros\xa0(1961)      $750,000 + 10% of gross      The Longest Day\xa0(1962)      $250,000       The Greatest Story Ever Told\xa0(1965)      $250,000       The War Wagon\xa0(1967)      $1,000,000 + % of gross      The Green Berets\xa0(1968)      $1,000,000       Hellfighters\xa0(1968)      $1,000,000       Rio Lobo\xa0(1970)      $1,000,000       Brannigan\xa0(1975)      $500,000       The Shootist\xa0(1976)      $750,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nVera Ralston ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 37 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(2)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(11)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(18)  Overview (4)Date of Birth12\xa0July1923,\xa0Prague, Czechoslovakia [now Czech Republic] Date of Death9\xa0February2003,\xa0Santa Barbara, California, USA      \xa0(cancer)    Birth NameVera Helena HrubaHeight5\'\xa05""\xa0(1.65\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          After achieving modest fame as an ice skater in her native Czechoslovakia, Vera Hruba was brought to America by Republic Pictures head Herbert J. Yates, who hoped to turn her into the next Sonja Henie. After featuring her in several Ice Capades movies, he added ""Ralston"" to her name and tried to pass her off as a leading lady. Hruba\'s English was so limited she was forced to learn her lines phonetically. Her English improved, and directors said she tried hard to learn her craft, but bad acting and a thick accent made it difficult for audiences to accept her.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Ray Hamel          Spouse (2)               Charles de Alva          (16 June\xa01973            - 9 February\xa02003)\xa0(her death)           Herbert J.

The surname Ralston was taken from the name of a popular breakfast cereal.      Interviewed by Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962), Maureen Stapleton was asked what she did to make herself feel better when she knew she\'d given a bad performance. ""I look through the TV Guide and try to find a Vera Hruba Ralston picture to watch,"" said Stapleton, ""because I know, no matter how bad a performance I may have given, I could NEVER be as bad as she was!"".      Much like the Susan Foster Kane character in Citizen Kane (1941), Ralston is generally conceded to owe what stardom she had to her position as ""protege"" of Republic Pictures studio head Herbert J. Yates. Most of her films lost money, because audiences just never took to her (John Wayne, after having made a few films with her, refused to make any more as he believed that being identified as appearing in any more of her flops would damage his career). She and Yates were married in 1952. Significantly, she ""retired"" from the screen in 1958, the year Yates was deposed as head of the studio--mainly because of his insistence in starring her in expensive films even though they invariably lost money but also because of his refusal to sell Republic\'s films for TV broadcasting. Yates and Ralston remained married until Yates\' death in 1966, at which point Ralston inherited half of his $10-million estate.      A beautiful young actress came to Hollywood but was forced to change her name because, even though she was born Vera Ralston, she couldn\'t use her own name because this Vera Ralston had used it first. So she changed her name and became known as Vera Miles.      Sister of Rudy Ralston.      Escaped her native Czechoslovakia on the last plane out before the Nazis closed the borders.      An accomplished figure skater.      She was an ardent conservative-minded Republican and fervent anti-communist.      Became a naturalized United States Citizen in 1946.      Her age and date of birth are often uncertain; at various times some scholars gave her birthyear as 1919, 1920, 1921, and 1923 as her year of birth and in some cases her month of birth was listed as July versus June. Her accurate date of birth is July 12, 1923, as verfied by the social security death index as well as her burial records at Santa Barbara Cemetery, Santa Barbara, California.Personal Quotes (18)      [Fair Wind to Java (1953)] was a hard picture for Fred [Fred MacMurray], because his wife [Lillian Lamont] was dying of cancer - and twice he had to leave the set to go home. Fred and Victor [Victor McLaglen] were delightful to work with. Victor was a very funny man. A gentleman. Fred was a charming, charming man.      [on Walter Brennan] A delightful man; he played the captain in Dakota (1945) and didn\'t know what to do with the character. Then he told me, ""Don\'t get scared, but I\'m gonna take out my uppers"". He wasn\'t as old as he looked like he was. Years later, he had to have an operation, and came to the hospital in Santa Barbara for it. So, I visited him in the hospital every day; I brought him food and we\'d reminisce about the old days. An interesting thing was that when we started \'Dakota\', the war was going on. While we were doing it, the war was over. We went to John Wayne\'s house to celebrate - Walter Brennan and the rest of the cast - we were at John Wayne\'s house. I\'ll never forget that!      I never miss watching the winter Olympics. Those girls are so talented; the techniques are so improved. What I did once they could do twice; if I did it twice, they do it three times.      I enjoyed locations, and wearing the costumes, and especially those hats. Hats make you look good.      [on memorabilia] I kept some - costumes, 16mm films, but some of it I donated to this museum and that museum. After all, what can you do with it? They are all so hard to preserve.      [Dakota (1945)] was recently colorized, and I frankly like it better in color. It gives you more with the costumes and the scenery...it is nicer. It makes me think of The Fighting Kentuckian (1949), the second picture I made with Duke, which is what everybody called him [John Wayne]. He told me he loved the color of the costume I was wearing. He wanted his wife to get a dress of this same color, which, unfortunately, you didn\'t see in the film because it was in black and white. I knew John Wayne very well. He was a close family friend.      [on her movies] I do see them. I didn\'t watch rushes, because you are never satisfied - you wished you\'d done it this way or that way. But, those days are gone. I had a good time.      [on her Czech accent] It was something I just couldn\'t lose, no matter how hard I tried.      [on Fair Wind to Java (1953)] [Joseph Kane] directed me more strictly. I had to have dark hair, dark make-up. When I\'d quit work for the day, I\'d take a bath immediately, and the water would be black. I had fun doing it, but it was so hot out there - 105 degrees - and it was very difficult to do. Incidentally, although he isn\'t credited, John Ford did the location scenes in that, the Java scenes. I had hoped to work with John Ford one day, but I never did. He went to Java with the crew.      [on Ward Bond] We got along very well, we were close friends. He\'d tell jokes; he was very funny. In pictures, he played serious parts, but he was very funny off-screen. I asked him how he could do that - be funny in real life; be so mean and serious in pictures, and he told me, ""That\'s acting!"".      I was very fortunate in my career to work with all nice, kind people. And John Wayne was the nicest of them all. I get along with crews and actors - life is too short to argue.      [Joseph Kane] directed me 11 times. He was one of my favorite directors, a nice man, with a very lovely family. His wife and children. His daughter Louise [Louise Kane], who was eight at the time, played me as a child in Wyoming (1947). Joe Kane was a very charming man. He loved horses more than people. I enjoyed working with him. He did pay more attention to the action scenes than to the actors\' scenes, and I didn\'t appreciate that part.      [on her career beginnings] When we were coming to Hollywood, I was asked if there was a movie star I\'d like to meet, and I said, ""Of course, John Wayne!"" I never dreamed I\'d actually meet him, and star with him in two pictures. Republic gave me a screen test to see if I could act. They thought I might have talent, and the test went very well, because I was signed to a contract. I made several ""ice pictures"". I was in Lake Placid Serenade (1944) and Murder in the Music Hall (1946), but I consider my first real movie The Lady and the Monster (1944) with Richard Arlen, followed by Storm Over Lisbon (1944) with Robert Livingston.      [on ice skating] I came in second to Sonja Henie in the 1936 Winter Olympics in Berlin. Sonja was so elegant and graceful, I admired her so much. She was an excellent skater; I have great respect for her. People don\'t realize how hard and dangerous skating can be. I suffered several broken bones, ankles. There are long hours to it, practicing. It is a part of my life that is gone forever.      [on coming to America] My mother and I came over first, to escape the Nazis. My brother Rudy [Rudy Ralston] came later and went into the war. My father was the last to come. I was the champion skater of Czechoslovakia and later the world. I was part of the Ice Capades and we toured America. When we came to California, Republic saw the show and loved it. They put everyone under contract and made Ice-Capades (1941) which was so successful they made a follow-up, Ice-Capades Revue (1942), the following year. I always wanted to be an actress, ever since I was a little girl. It was my dream. I would see the American pictures, people like Jean Harlow, and always wanted to be one of them.      I like outside, I love animals and I love horses, but I am not too keen about being *on* a horse! I fell off once and never got over it. But I did ride horses - in fact, I often did the doubling for myself in pictures. That is, until one day, the insurance people came up to me and put a stop to it. When they have you on a horse, you are sitting on the horse. Then the director calls action, a bell rings, and the horse gets nervous. And that made *me* nervous - after I had fallen off!John Wayne was a very big star when we made Dakota (1945), and it was my third acting picture. He was so kind; he showed me, helped me...he helped any youngsters getting started. He was so patient with me.      Republic was a small studio and it was all like family. Everybody knew each other. There were very few outsiders in your pictures. It was usually the same people, all together. John Wayne was so fond of Herbert J. Yates - they were very good friends - that Wayne would keep returning to the studio, after he was a big, big star.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nWalter Brennan ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 39 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(28)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(4)\xa0|Salary\xa0(1)  Overview (4)Date of Birth25\xa0July1894,\xa0Lynn, Massachusetts, USA Date of Death21\xa0September1974,\xa0Oxnard, California, USA      \xa0(emphysema)    Birth NameWalter Andrew BrennanHeight6\'\xa0(1.83\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          In many ways the most successful and familiar character actor of American sound films and the only actor to date to win three Oscars for Best Supporting Actor, Walter Brennan attended college in Cambridge, Massachusetts, studying engineering. While in school he became interested in acting and performed in school plays. He worked some in vaudeville and also in various jobs such as clerking in a bank and as a lumberjack. He toured in small musical comedy companies before entering the military in 1917. After his war service he went to Guatemala and raised pineapples, then migrated to Los Angeles, where he speculated in real estate. A few jobs as a film extra came his way beginning in 1923, then some work as a stuntman. He eventually achieved speaking roles, going from bit parts to substantial supporting parts in scores of features and short subjects between 1927 and 1938. In 1936 his role in Come and Get It (1936) won him the very first Best Supporting Actor Academy Award. He would win it twice more in the decade, and be nominated for a fourth. His range was enormous. He could play sophisticated businessmen, con artists, local yokels, cowhands and military officers with apparent equal ease. An accident in 1932 cost him most of his teeth, and he most often was seen in eccentric rural parts, often playing characters much older than his actual age. His career never really declined, and in the 1950s he became an even more endearing and familiar figure in several television series, most famously The Real McCoys (1957). He died in 1974 of emphysema, a beloved figure in movies and TV, the target of countless comic impressionists, and one of the best and most prolific actors of his time.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Jim Beaver          Spouse (1) Ruth Wells Brennan (17 October\xa01920            - 21 September\xa01974)\xa0(his death)\xa0(3 children)          Trivia (28)      First actor to accumulate three Academy Awards and to date still the only actor to win three Oscars as Best Supporting Actor.      Father of Ruth Brennan with Ruth Wells Brennan.      Father of Arthur Wells \'Mike\' Brennan and Andy Brennan with Ruth Wells Brennan.      Interred at San Fernando Mission Cemetery, San Fernando, Los Angeles County, California, USA      Had four top 100 singles, including the Top 5 hit ""Old Rivers"" (Liberty Records) which first charted on April 7, 1962. The single spent 11 weeks on the Billboard charts and peaked at number 5.      He won the first ever Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Come and Get It (1936).      Inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 1970.      His relatives still live in and around Joseph, Oregon where the actor maintained a functioning ranch.      Owned a ranch and several businesses in Joseph, Oregon, including the Indian Lodge Motel which still displays several of his portraits in the office.      Hardly ever played the villain, usually being cast as the somewhat eccentric pal to the hero. An exception was his turn as the heartless Old Man Clanton in My Darling Clementine (1946), directed by the prickly John Ford. Ford and Brennan did not get along, and Ford was one of the few directors Brennan didn\'t collaborate with more than once throughout his career.      Always fiscally and ideologically conservative, he became politically active in later life when he saw many of the things he held dear being eroded by the counterculture movement. He supported George Wallace\'s presidential campaign in 1968 and in 1972 supported extreme right-wing Republican Representative John Schmitz (father of Mary Kay Letourneau), as the incumbent President Richard Nixon was viewed as too progressive by many Republicans.      After his military service during World War I, Brennan moved to Los Angeles, where he got involved in the real-estate market and made a fortune. Unfortunately the market took a sudden downturn and Brennan lost almost all of his money. Broke, he began taking bit parts in films in order to earn money, and his career progressed from there.      Brennan had already worked in vaudeville when he enlisted at age 22 to serve in World War I. He served in an artillery unit and although he got through the war without being wounded, his exposure to poison gas ruined his vocal cords, leaving him with the high-pitched voice texture that made him a natural for old man roles while still in his thirties.The Real McCoys (1957) was such a hit that John Wayne\'s production company, Batjac, was persuaded to release a previously shelved film, William A. Wellman\'s Good-bye, My Lady (1956), about a boy, an old man, and a dog, during the show\'s run.      Actively supported Ronald Reagan\'s campaign to become Governor of California in 1966.      Campaigned for Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election, after the senator had voted against the Civil Rights Act.      There was some controversy over the Academy Awards Brennan won because in that period of time the rules of the Academy permitted extras to cast votes for the nominees, and Brennan, who had been an extra for some time before his more substantial roles came along, was popular among his fellow extra workers and they felt they were voting for one of their own.      Director Howard Hawks had related the story that, after completing Red River (1948), he was approached by an actor but couldn\'t quite place the face. The actor removed his teeth and said, ""Do you recognize me now?"" Hawks immediately recognized him as Brennan.      In 1925 Gary Cooper befriended another young, struggling, would-be actor named Walter Brennan. At one point, they were even appearing as a team at casting offices, and although Cooper emerged in major and leading roles first, they would work together in the good years, too. Most memorably they starred in The Westerner (1940) together, where the general critical consensus was that Brennan\'s underplayed performance as Judge Roy Bean had stolen the film from Cooper.      Although he was known for playing ""old-coot"" Southerners complete with cackling laugh and thick Southern accent, in reality he actually had somewhat of a New England accent, being born and raised in Massachusets,.      He was offered the supporting role of Mr. Judson in Herbie Rides Again (1974), but was too ill with emphysema to take the job. It was then recast with John McIntire. Brennan died 90 days after the movie was released to theaters, on June 6, 1974.      He and Katharine Hepburn are the only actors to win 3 Oscars on 3 consecutive nominations.      Holds the record for winning the most acting Oscars in the shortest amount of time (3 in 4 years).      2 of his 3 Oscar-winning performances were directed by William Wyler. This makes him one of four actors to win two Oscars under the same person\'s direction. The other three are: Jack Nicholson for Terms of Endearment (1983) and As Good as It Gets (1997) (both directed by James L. Brooks), Dianne Wiest for Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) and Bullets Over Broadway (1994) (both directed by Woody Allen) and Christoph Waltz for Inglourious Basterds (2009) and Django Unchained (2012) (both directed by Quentin Tarantino).      In June 1928, filming a scene in San Diego, he accidentally drove a automobile into the harbor.      His third Oscar win led to the disenfranchisement of the Extras Union from voting.      During the 1960s he was convinced that the anti-Vietnam War and civil rights movements were being run by overseas Communists, and said as much in interviews. He told reporters that he believed the civil rights movement in particular, and the riots in places like Watts and Newark, and demonstrations in Birmingham, Alabama, were the result of perfectly content ""negroes"" being stirred up by a handful of trouble-makers with an anti-American agenda.      Members of the cast and crew on the set of his last series, The Guns of Will Sonnett (1967) - in which he played the surprisingly complex role of an ex-army scout trying to undo the damage caused by his being a mostly absentee father - said that he cackled with delight upon learning of Martin Luther King\'s assassination.Personal Quotes (4)      When I see a good western . . .

Born in 1903 in Benkelman, Nebraska (confirmed by Social Security records; sources stating 1905 or Denver, Colorado are in error.) Bond grew up in Denver, the son of a lumberyard worker. He attended the University of Southern California, where he got work as an extra through a football teammate who would become both his best friend and one of cinema\'s biggest stars: John Wayne. Director John Ford promoted Bond from extra to supporting player in the film Salute (1929), and became another fast friend. An arrogant man of little tact, yet fun-loving in the extreme, Bond was either loved or hated by all who knew him. His face and personality fit perfectly into almost any type of film, and he appeared in hundreds of pictures in his more than 30-year career, in both bit parts and major supporting roles. In the films of Wayne and Ford, particularly, he was nearly always present. Among his most memorable roles are John L. Sullivan in Gentleman Jim (1942), Det. Tom Polhaus in The Maltese Falcon (1941) and the Rev. Capt. Samuel Johnson Clayton The Searchers (1956). An ardent but anti-intellectual patriot, he was perhaps the most vehement proponent, among the Hollywood community, of blacklisting in the witch hunts of the 1950s, and he served as a most unforgiving president of the ultra-right-wing Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals. In the mid-\'50s he gained his greatest fame as the star of TV\'s Wagon Train (1957). During its production, Bond traveled to Dallas, Texas, to attend a football game and died there in his hotel room of a massive heart attack.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net>          Spouse (2)               Mary Louise May          (23 August\xa01954            - 5 November\xa01960)\xa0(his death)                         Doris Sellers Childs          (28 April\xa01936            - 7 July\xa01944)\xa0(divorced)          Trade Mark (2)        Often played policemen, soldiers, sailors and cowboys.        Gruff resonant voice.Trivia (27)      A popular urban myth holds that on the day he died, Bond was scheduled to meet singer Johnny Horton in Dallas to sign a contract to appear on Wagon Train (1957). Horton died in an auto accident, hit by a drunk driver, at 1:30 a.m. and Bond died in Dallas at noon the same day. However, Bond was only the star of the series and not a producer, so he had no say in casting.      Many sources incorrectly quote 1905, and/or Denver, Colorado, USA regarding his birth.      Entered films in 1928 while attending the University of Southern California.      Family rumor is that Bond was a roommate at USC with John Wayne, who convinced him to go into acting. They were apparently best friends; one of their favorite activities in their youth was to go to bars, get drunk, and start fights.      On a hunting trip, he was accidentally shot by John Wayne. Bond left Wayne the shotgun in his will.      In The Wings of Eagles (1957), Bond played his friend, director John Ford, under the character name John Dodge (the name itself was a play on American automobile names. Ford was a real-life friend of the film\'s subject character). The set dressing, wardrobe, and Oscars in the scene are all actually Ford\'s.      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6933 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on February 8, 1960.      The muppet ""Bert"" on Sesame Street (1969) was rumored to be named after Bond\'s character (Bert the cop) in It\'s a Wonderful Life (1946).      Bond appears in the most films (seven) of the American Film Institute\'s list of the 100 Greatest American Movies: It Happened One Night (1934), Bringing Up Baby (1938), Gone with the Wind (1939), The Grapes of Wrath (1940), The Maltese Falcon (1941), It\'s a Wonderful Life (1946) and The Searchers (1956).      Was an epileptic, a closely guarded secret not made public until many years after his death.      Inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 2001.      Although John Ford mocked many actors mercilessly (including John Wayne), Bond probably was on the receiving end of the worst verbal punishment from the director (who counted Bond among his favorite actors). At Bond\'s funeral, Ford walked up to Andy Devine and said, ""Now YOU\'RE the biggest asshole I know."".      Although his career was cut short by his premature death in 1960 at age 57, he was one of the most prolific of Hollywood\'s actors over a period of 30 years. He regularly appeared in 10 to 20 films per year, with the record year for him being 1935, when he acted in 30 movies.      Worked with director John Ford on 26 films. Few, if any, actors, have appeared in so many films for a single director.      On his way to John Wayne\'s wedding, he was hit by a car but performed his duty as best man on crutches.      Bond\'s deep involvement in ultra-right-wing politics--and especially his enthusiastic efforts to blacklist suspected Communists and anyone with ""progressive"" political views in Hollywood--earned him the enmity of many in the film business. For several years, he could not get any work in films other than those of his right-wing friends like John Wayne, and he believed that ""liberal"" producers and directors blacklisted him. Then in 1957, at age 54, he made an enormous comeback as Major Seth Adams in Wagon Train (1957), and was finally a star in his own right.      Bond has been officially remembered with a television star on Hollywood Boulevard, by being inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum, and by a Ward Bond Memorial Park in his birthplace of Benkelman, Nebraska. However, he is probably most fondly remembered for his enormous output of solid work, with great respect by the industry.      Died at the Town House Motor Hotel on 2914 Harry Hines Boulevard in Dallas, Texas.      Campaigned for Republican Richard Nixon in the 1960 presidential election.John Wayne gave the eulogy at his funeral.      According to Orson Welles, one night at Chasen\'s Restaurant in Hollywood, Bond cut off Welles\' tie.      Once while on location, John Ford had a photo taken of himself and John Wayne standing on either side of the rear end of a horse. He sent the photo to Bond with the caption, ""Thinking of you"".      He appeared in three Best Picture Academy Award winners: It Happened One Night (1934), You Can\'t Take It with You (1938) and Gone with the Wind (1939). Irving Bacon, Eddy Chandler and Wallis Clark also appeared in all three films.      He appeared in 11 films that were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, more than anyone other than Bess Flowers: Arrowsmith (1931), Lady for a Day (1933), It Happened One Night (1934), You Can\'t Take It with You (1938), Gone with the Wind (1939), The Grapes of Wrath (1940), The Maltese Falcon (1941), Sergeant York (1941), It\'s a Wonderful Life (1946), The Quiet Man (1952) and Mister Roberts (1955).      United States census records from 1940 show a son, Kenneth Bond, approximately 12 years old, living in his household.      He had been diagnosed with high blood pressure but refused to cut back his work schedule on Wagon Train (1957).

This is one of the worst John Wayne flicks of the 1940s. By this point
in his career, Wayne was now a star and deserved better material and a
better leading lady. If you compare this film with THEY WERE
EXPENDABLE, which came out the same year, the contrast is great. DAKOTA
is simply a B-western with lousy and very confusing writing. While it
has good supporting actors in Ward Bond and Mike Mazurki, Vera Ralston
as Wayne's wife is incredibly wooden and she sports a bizarre accent
that can't be accounted for in the script (her dad seemed like he had a
French accent and she was Czechoslovakian). Most of the time, she's
kind of pretty to look at, but becomes more of an annoyance than
anything else. It was hard to figure WHY Wayne would have married such
an idiot in the first place! The only reasons she got ANY roles is that
her lover was the head of Republic Pictures--otherwise, she was much
more of a liability than an asset. As I already mentioned, the plot is
completely convoluted--and I really had to struggle to figure out what
was going on. Part of this COULD have been because the movie just
wasn't engaging. This is a forgettable film and only of interest to big
fans of John Wayne. There are so many better Wayne films available--try
watching one of them first.

It's interesting to follow John Wayne's career progress, from the early
Lone Star Western days up through the leading roles he's most famous
for in the Sixties and Seventies. Here, in ""Dakota"", and in other films
of the era, he probably appeared at his best in terms of rugged good
looks and athletic skill. He cuts an impressive figure, particularly
with leading lady Vera Ralston by his side to smooth out the rougher
edges.<br><br>The film itself isn't particularly noteworthy for it's story line, a
theme that's been done time and again in the genre. Evil land grabbers
attempt to swindle hard working honest folks out of their wheat farms
just before the railroad comes through so they can cash in for the
quick kill. Ward Bond portrays the main bad guy with subtle malice as
he engineers the land swindle, while pro boxer/wrestler/strong man Mike
Mazurki is his top henchman. Bond's character Jim Bender in particular
is a much smoother characterization than one is used to seeing in these
types of oaters; more than one wheat farmer commented on how honest he
seemed to be with his calm demeanor and dialog.<br><br>The picture gets off to a wild start as John Devlin (Wayne) elopes with
Sandy Poli (Ralston), as they manage to outrun her father who
disapproves of the already completed marriage. In a well crafted scene,
Marko Poli (Hugo Haas) turns the tenor of the early story on a dime as
he comically attempts to send off a telegram to the daughter that got
away. The scene sets the stage for additional comic relief, primarily
supplied by Walter Brennan in a wonderful portrayal of the 'River Bird'
Captain Bounce. Most of the time Bounce can be heard talking to himself
in the colorful language he's known for, and it's a hoot to catch his
antics, particularly in the grounded riverboat scene.<br><br>Nick Stewart is the captain's sidekick, his gimmick is a constant
handkerchief wipe of face and brow that signals a nervous twitch. His
black character is somewhat stereotypical in presentation, but not as
racially charged as mentioned elsewhere in this forum. Probably the
worst that can be said about it is that it resembles a 'Step 'n
Fetchit' type of portrayal, though it comes in handy for Wayne's
character later in the story to signal the bad guys on the move.<br><br>There's a neat device near the finale when Devlin goes after Collins
(Mazurki). While pushing through the door of the cabin, Devlin pulls
Collins' hat down over his face prior to bashing him. That's a move I
hadn't seen before.<br><br>Probably the most unusual and in it's way most refreshing element of
the story is the way Ralston's character keeps one step ahead of her
new husband by pulling the strings on their future together. With his
eye set on California, Devlin never makes it as the Mrs. manages to
shanghai his plans every step along the way. It's also on that note
that the movie ends, with the Captain's refurbished riverboat horn
drowning out Devlin's protest against another one of her manufactured
schemes.

Vera Ralston was an actress that was cast into films because she was
married to the big boss of Republic. In Dakota she comes out
surprisingly well as Sandy Poli a determined woman, daughter of a
millionaire who marries John Wayne. He wants to go to California, but
she chooses Dakota and from then on she is the one who makes the most
important decisions for the couple. It is not usual to see John Wayne
in this situation but it makes the film more interesting. There are two
familiar actors also, Walter Brennan and Ward Bond. It is remarkable
that with a low budget they made quite a convincing scenery of what
Fargo,Dakota must have looked like. The movie is quite entertaining
except for the fact also mentioned in one of the comments, that they
make too much use of scenes taking place at night. No need for that, it
only makes it harder to understand what is going on.

DAKOTA is a surprisingly decent John Wayne western, well-shot in 1945
and featuring the famous actor playing a small-time gambler who elopes
with his love to the West, only to discover that his intended homestead
is controlled by a pair of criminals who are up to all kinds of no good
in order to keep an iron grip on the land. Conflict ensues.<br><br>Despite some indifferent reviews, I thought this film told its story
very effectively and with a maximum of intrigue and excitement. Wayne
gives a fine fine and assured performance as the smooth hero and Vera
Ralston matches him as a love interest you can get behind. Ward Bond
and Mike Mazurki make an imposing couple of villains and the rest of
the cast is full of familiar faces and/or larger than life characters.
There's not really a wealth of action here, but that which does occur
is great fun; the hold up on the river boat and the climactic shoot-out
are the highlights.

This is possibly the best of the one hour movies that John Wayne made for
Republic Pictures.  From the opening sequence the film moves at a brisk
pace.  Although the theme is one of helping people protect their lands and
their future, there are also lighter moments of comedy.

This was one of those B-movie Westerns John Wayne had to pay his dues,
and learn his craft in, on his way to superstardom and becoming a
household name. His acting chops, while coming along and becoming more
multidimensional, are still developing, and he gets by more or less on
his charisma and big smile. Joseph Kane provides decent, pedestrian
direction--all of the exciting scenes are directed by Wayne's longtime
associate, Yakima Canutt (the one who would later direct the
outstanding chariot race in 'Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ'), and Vera
Ralston is great as the loving wife who just seems to do the wrong
thing at the worst possible time.<br><br>Ward Bond and Mike Mazurki are excellent as the bad guys, and Walter
Brennan (as the most bipolar ship captain one will EVER find in cinema)
and Nick Stewart (as his harped-on assistant) steal every scene they're
in. Ona Munson even throws in an entertaining song-and-dance number,
and provides an interesting love possibility for Wayne, if he wasn't
such a one-woman guy.<br><br>This was released on Christmas Day in the States, and it's no lump of
coal in one's stocking, but a small, likable gift for fans of the
genre. Worth a watch if you like Westerns, and a purchase and rewatch
for Wayne enthusiasts.

of railroad magnate Hugo Haas. A whim of Ralston's finds them on the
way to Dakota Territory instead of the Duke's planned trip to
California. <br><br>Before long Wayne finds himself mixed up with the local farmers and
their running battle with town boss of Fargo, Ward Bond and his three
loathsome sidekicks Mike Mazurki, Paul Fix, and Grant Withers. Mike
Mazurki is a particularly nasty individual here, he probably has the
best performance in the film.<br><br>Dakota was directed by Joseph Kane who directed at Republic a whole lot
of Roy Rogers B westerns and he uses the same fast pace here. The
running time is only 82 minutes and a Wayne film from Republic was an A
product for that studio by 1945.<br><br>One big drawback in Dakota is the portrayal by Nick Stewart as Walter
Brennan's crew on his river steamboat. It's a pretty bad stereotype one
of the worst I've ever seen on film.<br><br>Dakota also shamelessly rips off the wheat burning scene from Samuel
Goldwyn's The Westerner. I wouldn't be surprised if Goldwyn let Yates
use some of the footage from The Westerner for a rental fee.<br><br>However fans of John Wayne and of westerns in general will like it.

John Wayne elopes with the daughter of a wealthy immigrant family.
Taking off for Fargo, he squares off against nasty Ward Bond, who had
his life-savings stolen and is in the process of taking land in
anticipation of the coming railroad.<br><br>One of the minor Republic vehicles the Duke cranked out in the
nineteen-forties, this starts out well, though it runs out of steam
mid-way, ending up being okay but unspectacular and unmemorable.<br><br>Production values and performances are good, but this seems bloated,
even at 83 minutes. Republic should have tightened it up and made it
one of their hour-long programmers.<br><br>The best thing about this is crusty, old riverboat captain Walter
Brennan. He and his sidekick almost steal the movie.

This is one of the worst John Wayne flicks of the 1940s. By this point
in his career, Wayne was now a star and deserved better material and a
better leading lady. If you compare this film with THEY WERE
EXPENDABLE, which came out the same year, the contrast is great. DAKOTA
is simply a B-western with lousy and very confusing writing. While it
has good supporting actors in Ward Bond and Mike Mazurki, Vera Ralston
as Wayne's wife is incredibly wooden and she sports a bizarre accent
that can't be accounted for in the script (her dad seemed like he had a
French accent and she was Czechoslovakian). Most of the time, she's
kind of pretty to look at, but becomes more of an annoyance than
anything else. It was hard to figure WHY Wayne would have married such
an idiot in the first place! The only reasons she got ANY roles is that
her lover was the head of Republic Pictures--otherwise, she was much
more of a liability than an asset. As I already mentioned, the plot is
completely convoluted--and I really had to struggle to figure out what
was going on. Part of this COULD have been because the movie just
wasn't engaging. This is a forgettable film and only of interest to big
fans of John Wayne. There are so many better Wayne films available--try
watching one of them first.

It's interesting to follow John Wayne's career progress, from the early
Lone Star Western days up through the leading roles he's most famous
for in the Sixties and Seventies. Here, in ""Dakota"", and in other films
of the era, he probably appeared at his best in terms of rugged good
looks and athletic skill. He cuts an impressive figure, particularly
with leading lady Vera Ralston by his side to smooth out the rougher
edges.<br><br>The film itself isn't particularly noteworthy for it's story line, a
theme that's been done time and again in the genre. Evil land grabbers
attempt to swindle hard working honest folks out of their wheat farms
just before the railroad comes through so they can cash in for the
quick kill. Ward Bond portrays the main bad guy with subtle malice as
he engineers the land swindle, while pro boxer/wrestler/strong man Mike
Mazurki is his top henchman. Bond's character Jim Bender in particular
is a much smoother characterization than one is used to seeing in these
types of oaters; more than one wheat farmer commented on how honest he
seemed to be with his calm demeanor and dialog.<br><br>The picture gets off to a wild start as John Devlin (Wayne) elopes with
Sandy Poli (Ralston), as they manage to outrun her father who
disapproves of the already completed marriage. In a well crafted scene,
Marko Poli (Hugo Haas) turns the tenor of the early story on a dime as
he comically attempts to send off a telegram to the daughter that got
away. The scene sets the stage for additional comic relief, primarily
supplied by Walter Brennan in a wonderful portrayal of the 'River Bird'
Captain Bounce. Most of the time Bounce can be heard talking to himself
in the colorful language he's known for, and it's a hoot to catch his
antics, particularly in the grounded riverboat scene.<br><br>Nick Stewart is the captain's sidekick, his gimmick is a constant
handkerchief wipe of face and brow that signals a nervous twitch. His
black character is somewhat stereotypical in presentation, but not as
racially charged as mentioned elsewhere in this forum. Probably the
worst that can be said about it is that it resembles a 'Step 'n
Fetchit' type of portrayal, though it comes in handy for Wayne's
character later in the story to signal the bad guys on the move.<br><br>There's a neat device near the finale when Devlin goes after Collins
(Mazurki). While pushing through the door of the cabin, Devlin pulls
Collins' hat down over his face prior to bashing him. That's a move I
hadn't seen before.<br><br>Probably the most unusual and in it's way most refreshing element of
the story is the way Ralston's character keeps one step ahead of her
new husband by pulling the strings on their future together. With his
eye set on California, Devlin never makes it as the Mrs. manages to
shanghai his plans every step along the way. It's also on that note
that the movie ends, with the Captain's refurbished riverboat horn
drowning out Devlin's protest against another one of her manufactured
schemes.

Vera Ralston was an actress that was cast into films because she was
married to the big boss of Republic. In Dakota she comes out
surprisingly well as Sandy Poli a determined woman, daughter of a
millionaire who marries John Wayne. He wants to go to California, but
she chooses Dakota and from then on she is the one who makes the most
important decisions for the couple. It is not usual to see John Wayne
in this situation but it makes the film more interesting. There are two
familiar actors also, Walter Brennan and Ward Bond. It is remarkable
that with a low budget they made quite a convincing scenery of what
Fargo,Dakota must have looked like. The movie is quite entertaining
except for the fact also mentioned in one of the comments, that they
make too much use of scenes taking place at night. No need for that, it
only makes it harder to understand what is going on.

DAKOTA is a surprisingly decent John Wayne western, well-shot in 1945
and featuring the famous actor playing a small-time gambler who elopes
with his love to the West, only to discover that his intended homestead
is controlled by a pair of criminals who are up to all kinds of no good
in order to keep an iron grip on the land. Conflict ensues.<br><br>Despite some indifferent reviews, I thought this film told its story
very effectively and with a maximum of intrigue and excitement. Wayne
gives a fine fine and assured performance as the smooth hero and Vera
Ralston matches him as a love interest you can get behind. Ward Bond
and Mike Mazurki make an imposing couple of villains and the rest of
the cast is full of familiar faces and/or larger than life characters.
There's not really a wealth of action here, but that which does occur
is great fun; the hold up on the river boat and the climactic shoot-out
are the highlights.

This is possibly the best of the one hour movies that John Wayne made for
Republic Pictures.  From the opening sequence the film moves at a brisk
pace.  Although the theme is one of helping people protect their lands and
their future, there are also lighter moments of comedy.

This was one of those B-movie Westerns John Wayne had to pay his dues,
and learn his craft in, on his way to superstardom and becoming a
household name. His acting chops, while coming along and becoming more
multidimensional, are still developing, and he gets by more or less on
his charisma and big smile. Joseph Kane provides decent, pedestrian
direction--all of the exciting scenes are directed by Wayne's longtime
associate, Yakima Canutt (the one who would later direct the
outstanding chariot race in 'Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ'), and Vera
Ralston is great as the loving wife who just seems to do the wrong
thing at the worst possible time.<br><br>Ward Bond and Mike Mazurki are excellent as the bad guys, and Walter
Brennan (as the most bipolar ship captain one will EVER find in cinema)
and Nick Stewart (as his harped-on assistant) steal every scene they're
in. Ona Munson even throws in an entertaining song-and-dance number,
and provides an interesting love possibility for Wayne, if he wasn't
such a one-woman guy.<br><br>This was released on Christmas Day in the States, and it's no lump of
coal in one's stocking, but a small, likable gift for fans of the
genre. Worth a watch if you like Westerns, and a purchase and rewatch
for Wayne enthusiasts.

His mother died while he was a toddler and his father abandoned the family, leaving him to be raised by his sister Cecilia and her husband Elfred. He received a scholarship to Oxford University to study acting and made his first stage appearance in 1944.His first film appearances were in routine British movies such as The Last Days of Dolwyn (1949), Waterfront (1950) and Green Grow the Rushes (1951). Then he started to appear in Hollywood movies such as My Cousin Rachel (1952), The Robe (1953) and Alexander the Great (1956), added to this he was also spending considerable time in stage productions, both in the UK and USA, often to splendid reviews.The late 1950s was an exciting and inventive time in UK cinema, often referred to as the ""British New Wave"", and Burton was right in the thick of things, and showcased a sensational performance in Look Back in Anger (1959). He also appeared with a cavalcade of international stars in the World War II magnum opus The Longest Day (1962), and then onto arguably his most ""notorious"" role as that of Marc Antony opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the hugely expensive Cleopatra (1963). This was, of course, the film that kick-started their fiery and passionate romance (plus two marriages), and the two of them appeared in several productions over the next few years including The V.I.P.s (1963), The Sandpiper (1965), the dynamic Who\'s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) and The Taming of the Shrew (1967), as well as box office flops like The Comedians (1967), _Dr. Faustus_, and the disastrous _Boom!_. However, Burton was often better when he was off on his own giving higher caliber performances, such as those in Becket (1964), the film adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play The Night of the Iguana (1964), the brilliant espionage thriller The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965) and alongside Clint Eastwood in the World War II action adventure film Where Eagles Dare (1968).His audience appeal began to decline somewhat by the end of the 1960s as fans turned to younger, more virile male stars, however Burton was superb in Anne of the Thousand Days (1969) as King Henry VIII, he put on a reasonable show in the boring Raid on Rommel (1971), was over the top in the awful Villain (1971), gave sleepwalking performances in Hammersmith Is Out (1972) and Bluebeard (1972), and was wildly miscast in the ludicrous The Assassination of Trotsky (1972).By the early 1970s, quality male lead roles were definitely going to other stars, and Burton found himself appearing in some movies of dubious quality, just to pay the bills and support family, including Divorce His - Divorce Hers (1973) (his last on-screen appearance with Taylor), Klansman (1974), Brief Encounter (1974), Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977), The Medusa Touch (1978), _Breakthrough_, and _Circle of Two_. However, he won another Oscar nomination for his excellent performance as a concerned psychiatrist in Equus (1977). He appeared with fellow acting icons Richard Harris and Roger Moore in The Wild Geese (1978) about mercenaries in South Africa, and whilst the film had a modest initial run, over the past thirty-five years it has picked up quite a cult following.His final performances were as the sinister ""O\'Brien"" in Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984), and in the TV mini series Ellis Island (1984). He passed away on August 5th, 1984 in Celigny, Switzerland from a cerebral hemorrhage.Burton was an avid fan of Shakespeare, poetry and reading, having once said ""home is where the books are"".- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       firehouse44@hotmail.com          Spouse (5) Sally Hay (3 July\xa01983            - 5 August\xa01984)\xa0(his death)           Susan Hunt (21 August\xa01976            - 1982)\xa0(divorced)           Elizabeth Taylor (10 October\xa01975            - 29 July\xa01976)\xa0(divorced)           Elizabeth Taylor (15 March\xa01964            - 26 June\xa01974)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)           Sybil Williams (5 February\xa01949            - 5 December\xa01963)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(2 children)          Trade Mark (2)        Frequently played self-loathing characters, particularly in his later career.

The two became so close, Burton attempted to adopt him as his son, but was prevented from doing so as he was too young, under the law. Nevertheless, Jenkins, who became known to the world as Richard Burton, considered Philip Burton his adopted father and honored him by taking on his surname. Years later, when Philip Burton met Elizabeth Taylor and she asked Philip Burton how he came to adopt her soon-to-be fifth (and later sixth) husband, Richard piped up, ""He didn\'t adopt me! I adopted him!"".      Father of Kate Burton.      Interred at Protestant Churchyard, Céligny, Switzerland.      He once shared the record with Peter O\'Toole for the most Oscar acting nominations (7) without a single win. In 2007, that record was broken, when O\'Toole was nominated and lost yet again for the film Venus (2006).      Spoke Cymraeg (Welsh-language) as mother tongue.      He died on Sunday, August 5, 1984, less than a week before he was due to begin shooting Wild Geese II (1985), a sequel to his successful mercenary thriller The Wild Geese (1978), made in 1978. He was the only actor returning for the film and, as Colonel Allen Faulkner, would have led a team of crack mercenaries to spring aged Nazi Rudolf Hess from Spandau Prison in Berlin. Burton\'s death caused huge problems for producer Euan Lloyd, the man behind the original The Wild Geese (1978) and its follow-up, Wild Geese II (1985). With the rest of the cast (Scott Glenn, Barbara Carrera and Laurence Olivier (playing Hess)) in place, Euan Lloyd had just a handful of days to find a replacement for Burton. He selected British actor Edward Fox, who joined the cast as Alex Faulkner, Burton\'s brother. Burton\'s no-show in the film was explained by one character telling Edward Fox that they\'d heard his famous warrior brother had died. The film was dedicated to Burton\'s memory.      He made his stage debut at Maesteg Town Hall in Wales.      Suffered from acute insomnia.      The twelfth of thirteen children, he insisted that his way out of an impoverished Welsh childhood was due not to acting, but to books.      Had two daughters by his first wife, Sybil Williams. Actress Kate Burton (born 1957) and Jessica (born 1961), who was diagnosed as profoundly autistic and would eventually be institutionalized.      He was awarded the CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 1970 Queen\'s Birthday Honours List for his services to drama. He collected this award on his 45th birthday with his older sister Cis, who raised him as a child, and his wife Elizabeth Taylor.      Grandfather of Morgan Ritchie.      Burton received the first retrospective of his work since his death during Bradford Film Festival 2002 - almost 18 years after his death on Sunday, August 5, 1984. Twelve films were screened, among them Look Back in Anger (1959), Becket (1964), Equus (1977) and Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984), his final picture. The festival, which christened its Burton season Lion of the Welsh, also featured a strand on legendary unfinished films that included a clip of Burton in Laughter in the Dark (1969), a movie from which he was allegedly fired by director Tony Richardson. The picture, based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov, was shut down and eventually made with Nicol Williamson in Burton\'s role.      Was a drinking partner of Richard Harris and Peter O\'Toole until O\'Toole was forced to give up drinking after surgery in 1976.      Died shortly after the filming of Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984) was completed. He was in terrible health during filming from years of alcoholism and heavy smoking, and had to wear a neck brace during rehearsals.      He taught William Shakespeare to future actress Catherine Oxenberg when she was 13 and 14 years old.      He once bought a complete set of ""The Everyman Library"" for Elizabeth Taylor as a present.      He was on a flight to California from Mexico, when he ran into a young man interested in acting. Burton encouraged him to pursue it full time during their conversation. That young man was Kevin Costner, who promptly left his marketing job to pursue an acting career.      During World War II, he was admitted to Exeter College, Oxford to take the ""University Short Course"" for six months as a Royal Air Force cadet. While at Oxford in 1943-1944, he was a member of the Oxford University Dramatic Society. Cadets were promised that they could return to Oxford to complete their education after the war, but he did not, instead becoming a professional actor after being demobilized in 1947. Almost thirty years later, he was invited back to Oxford to teach poetry to undergraduates for a semester.      His mother died when he was two-years old. He was taken in and raised by his older sister, Cis, and her husband in the same Port Talbot, Wales, neighborhood where fellow Welshman Anthony Hopkins later lived in as a child. ""I shone in the reflection of her green-eyed, black-haired gypsy beauty,"" Burton said of his sister/surrogate mother.      He, Ray Milland, Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones all were born within a 10-mile radius in south-western Wales.      His movie contracts contained a clause that he did not have to work on the 1st of March, St David\'s Day, the day honoring the patron saint of Wales.      Had to turn down the lead role of the British Consul in John Huston\'s adaptation of Malcolm Lowry\'s Under the Volcano (1984) as he was appearing in a touring production of Noël Coward\'s ""Private Lives"" co-starring with Elizabeth Taylor. The role was subsequently played by Albert Finney, who won an Oscar nomination as Best Actor.      Was the best man at Laurence Olivier\'s marriage to Joan Plowright in New York City on March 17, 1961. Both were appearing on Broadway at the time, he in ""Camelot"" and Laurence Olivier in ""Becket"".      Was famous for his high intelligence and for being incredibly well-read. Burton was widely admired for his command and understanding of English poetry, which he taught for a term at Oxford University in the early 1970s.      His friend Laurence Olivier tried to interest him in taking over the National Theatre after his imminent retirement from the post. He declined, feeling that the board of directors had treated the great Laurence Olivier shabbily.      He once got into a contest with Robert F. Kennedy, whom he greatly admired, in which they tried to out-do the other by quoting William Shakespeare\'s sonnets. Both were word-perfect, and Burton was forced to ""win"" the contest by quoting one of the sonnets backwards.      Was a great fan of baseball, which he followed avidly when he was in America. Burton thought Pulitzer Prize-winning baseball columnist Red Smith was a brilliant writer. Burton played softball with a team from the Broadway theatre in the 1980s, despite crippling bursitis in his shoulder.      Won Broadway\'s 1961 Tony Award as Best Actor (Musical) for ""Camelot"" as well as a Special Award in 1976. He was also twice nominated for Tony Awards as Best Actor (Dramatic): for ""Time Remembered"" (1954) and for ""Hamlet"" (1964).      He and his then wife Elizabeth Taylor were very close friends with the famous president of Yugoslavia (Serbia), Marshall Josip Broz Tito. They spent many vacations with him at his villa on the Yugoslavian Adriatic coast line as well as being a frequent guest at his mansion in Belgrade. He later played his close friend in the 1972 Yugoslavian film Sutjeska (1973) (The Fifth Offensive).      He was engaged to Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia (Serbia & Montenegro) between the time of his two marriages to Elizabeth Taylor. Princess Elizabeth is the mother of Catherine Oxenberg whom he later coached on acting.      In 1961 he won a Tony Award for playing King Arthur in the original production of Lerner & Loewe\'s (Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe) Broadway musical ""Camelot"". When the film was in pre-production in the mid-1960s Burton turned down an attractive offer to reprise the role and Richard Harris was cast as The Once & Future King. Burton subsequently appeared in the 1980 Broadway revival of the musical, which played a total of 56 performances on the Great White Way before the production went on the road. During the road tour, Burton was replaced by Richard Harris as he was debilitated by crippling bursitis of the shoulder which eventually prevented him from handling a sword. Pain-killers did not help so he dropped out of the show and he was once again ""replaced"" by Richard Harris in the role.      Was nominated for a 1958 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for ""Time Remembered"". Three years later he won a 1961 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for ""Camelot"", and three years after that, he was again nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his 1964 ""Hamlet"", which was directed by his mentor John Gielgud. Burton also received a Special Tony Award in 1976 after appearing as a replacement in ""Equus"". Like his friends Laurence Olivier and Peter O\'Toole, Burton was an unique and utterly electrifying stage actor whom commanded the rapt attention of his audience.      Won the 1951 Theatre World Award for ""The Lady\'s Not For Burning"".      Since Elizabeth Taylor had been sterilized in 1957 (at age 25, after giving birth to three children), she and Eddie Fisher adopted a German orphan, Maria (born 1961) in 1962. Fisher surrendered his parental rights before they divorced and Richard adopted the girl as his daughter, legally re-naming her Maria Burton.      He and Elizabeth Taylor starred together in 11 movies: Who\'s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966); The V.I.P.s (1963); Under Milk Wood (1972); The Taming of the Shrew (1967); The Sandpiper (1965); Hammersmith Is Out (1972); Doctor Faustus (1967); Divorce His - Divorce Hers (1973); The Comedians (1967); Cleopatra (1963) and Boom (1968).      He was forced to drop out of the Los Angeles run of ""Camelot"" in April 1981 due to crippling back pain, most likely caused by his chronic bursitis. Doctors at the hospital couldn\'t understand how he had managed to entertain live audiences night after night. His entire spinal column was found to be coated in crystallized alcohol. At first the doctors couldn\'t operate because Burton was three stone underweight, so he had to remain in bed to build up his strength. His backbone was rebuilt in a delicate operation that could easily have left him paralyzed for life if something had gone wrong. Burton called his friend Richard Harris to replace him as King Arthur, and then returned to his home in Switzerland to recover.      Circa 1970, Burton\'s fellow Celt (and cinema superstar) Sean Connery, who had received excellent reviews for his portrayal of the doomed king in a 1960 Canadian television version of ""Macbeth"", hoped to launch a big-screen version of the Scottish play. Sean Connery\'s plans were foiled when Roman Polanski\'s version went into production for Hugh M. Hefner\'s Playboy Productions. Burton, who had won a reputation as the best ""Hamlet"" of his generation, was also interested in launching a film version of ""Macbeth"" at the same time. He had just had a great cinema success in the period piece Anne of the Thousand Days (1969), for which he won his sixth and penultimate Oscar nomination, and he told his friend Sir Laurence Olivier that he wanted to make a movie of ""Macbeth"" with himself as the eponymous king and his wife Elizabeth Taylor as Lady Macbeth. Burton\'s plans came to naught for the same reason as Sean Connery\'s did. A decade earlier, Sir Laurence Olivier - the greatest ""Macbeth"" of the 20th Century - had also failed to bring the play to the big screen. The future Lord Laurence Olivier had hoped to film his own version of the play in the late 1950s, but the failure of his movie Richard III (1955) to make back its money frustrated his plans. Producer Michael Todd, Elizabeth Taylor\'s third husband, told Laurence Olivier in 1958 that he likely would produce the film with Laurence Olivier as ""Macbeth"" and Laurence Olivier\'s real-life wife, Vivien Leigh, as his Lady, but that hope died in the plane crash that claimed Michael Todd\'s life. Thus, the famous ""Macbeth"" curse adversely affected three of the greatest actors of the 20th Century.      Won a Grammy in the ""Best Recording for Children"" category for ""The Little Prince"" (featuring Jonathan Winters and Billy Simpson). [1975]      His 1964 performance of ""Hamlet"" is the longest run of the play in Broadway history with 137 performances. It broke the record held by John Gielgud, who played the part for 132 performances and who directed Burton\'s Broadway production.      The producers of the film Equus (1977), who envisioned either Marlon Brando or Jack Nicholson in the role of the psychiatrist ""Martin Dysart"" in the film version, would only consider Burton for the role if he agreed to undertake a screen-test of sorts by playing the role on Broadway. Though considered one of the most brilliant theatre actors of his generation, Burton had not been on the professional stage in a dozen years (though he had appeared in an Oxford Undergradate Dramatic Society production of Doctor Faustus (which subsequently was filmed as Doctor Faustus (1967)) in 1966. Having suffered a slew of failures since 1970 that had undermined his bankability as a movie star, Burton agreed to take on the grueling role for a 12-week run. Though he was scheduled for his Broadway debut on a Sunday, he took over a Saturday matinée for the departing Anthony Perkins (who had received excellent notices after taking over for Anthony Hopkins, Burton\'s fellow Welshman who had grown up in his neighborhood in Wales and who had won a 1975 Drama Desk Award Outstanding Actor in a Play for originating Dysart on Broadway). The film producers frankly were worried that Burton\'s alcoholism, which had nearly killed him during the production of Klansman (1974), had not only destroyed his powers as an actor but his stamina also. Their fears were borne out the first night when a nervous Burton stumbled during the matinée. However, by Sunday\'s show, with the vultures out to see a great actor brought low, Burton wowed the audience with a brilliant performance. Burton astounded theatre-goers and the critics, winning himself a Special Tony Award and the role in the film. (His run was extended another two weeks due to demand to see the legendary thespian and hell-raiser and easily could have gone on for many more weeks had Burton chosen to remain with the play.) Burton\'s career was recharged. The momentum of Burton\'s professional renaissance nearly brought him an Academy Award in 1978, but sadly, it was reckoned that the performance caught on film by director Sidney Lumet was only a pale shadow of the genius that had been on show on Broadway. (Ironically, this was the charge that had plagued Burton in his early career, that the talent, the genius, did not come through the lens to be caught on film. Burton himself said he did not learn to act on film until he co-starred with Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra (1963).) Reverting to his 1970s habit of poor film choices, such as Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977) and The Medusa Touch (1978) tarnished Burton\'s newly burnished lustre too and Richard Dreyfuss beat him for the Oscar in his seventh (and last) Oscar nomination. Although he worked steadily until his death, Burton\'s post-Equus (1977) career never gained any real traction and he never again was a bankable star.      In addition to being honored with a Special Tony Award in 1976 for his triumphant return to Broadway after 12 years in Equus (1977), he was nominated three times for a Tony, winning once, in 1961 for Best Actor in a Musical for ""Camelot"". His other nominations were in 1958 (for Best Actor in Play) for ""Time Remembered"" and in 1964 (for Best Actor in Play) for Hamlet (1964).      After his second wife Elizabeth Taylor\'s close friend Montgomery Clift died before shooting began on Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967), Burton briefly considered taking over the vacated role of the closeted homosexual Major Weldon Penderton that had been slated for Montgomery Clift. Though Burton would later play homosexual parts in Staircase (1969) and Villain (1971), it was thought that he would not be a good fit for the role of an American soldier. The part subsequently went to Marlon Brando, who gave what critics now believe was one of his greatest performances. Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor became friends, giving Burton a chance to socialize with America\'s greatest actor.      Was actively pursued for the role of ""The Pilot"" in the proposed film of The Little Prince (1974). Burton had had a huge success on Broadway with Lerner & Lowe\'s (Alan Jay Lerner & Frederick Loewe) Camelot (1967), but had turned down that film as he did The Little Prince (1974). The role of ""The Pilot"" subsequently was played by Richard Kiley.      According to Melvyn Bragg\'s biography (that was based on Burton\'s own diaries) in 1959, he turned down an offer of $350,000 (approximately $2.25 million in 2005 terms) to star as ""Christ"" in Nicholas Ray\'s remake of King of Kings (1961) due to superstition. A Welsh-Irish drunkard had read the palms of Burton and some friends, including Dylan Thomas, who were performing poetry on B.B.C. Radio\'s ""Third Programme"" and were waiting for show-time in a local pub. The drunk predicted the friends\' deaths, which in the case of Dylan Thomas, was accurate. After two other friends died within their prescribed time frames, Burton (who had been told he would die at the age of 33) decided to take the year 1959 off so as not to tempt fate. Although he thought Nicholas Ray might make a good film and was keen to shoot on location in Spain, Burton, who already was a millionaire and did not need the money, turned the offer down. For the same reason, he also turned down the role played by Audie Murphy in John Huston\'s The Unforgiven (1960), which was shot in Durango, Mexico.      Planned on going back to the stage to appear in William Shakespeare\'s ""Richard III"" and ""King Lear"". His staging of ""Richard III"" would have been based on the ideas of his step-father, Philip Burton, to bring together all of William Shakespeare\'s dramatization of Richard, Duke of Glouster (later Richard III) from the ""Henry VI"" trilogy. Burton had planned on visiting his step-father in Florida in early 1985 to work on the project.      Loved to do crossword puzzles and was dismayed that American newspapers\' crosswords were more geared towards encyclopedic information rather than puns and wordplay.      At the time of his death in 1984, he was slated to reprise his role as Colonel Allen Faulkner in Wild Geese II (1985) and had signed on to star as the English journalist Thomas Fowler in a remake of Graham Greene\'s The Quiet American (1958). Wild Geese II (1985) went ahead with Edward Fox taking over his part (the film is dedicated to Burton), but the production of ""The Quiet American"" was canceled.      According to his long-time friend Brook Williams, the son of the man who had given Burton his first professional break Emlyn Williams, Burton turned down a role in The Sea Wolves: The Last Charge of the Calcutta Light Horse in 1980, which reunited The Wild Geese (1978) director Andrew V. McLaglen, screenwriter Reginald Rose and co-star Roger Moore. The Wild Geese (1978) had been a big hit (Burton was always popular and a box office draw in military roles) and Andrew V. McLaglen had directed Burton\'s post-The Wild Geese (1978) film Steiner - Das Eiserne Kreuz, 2. Teil (1979), but Burton turned it down. Brook Williams believed that Burton\'s third wife, Susan Hunt, didn\'t want Burton away on a lark with his old friends (and drinking companions) as he was in frail health and battling alcoholism at the time.      His divorce from third wife Susan Hunt, whom he was married to from 1976 to 1982, entailed a settlement of $1 million (approximately $2 million in 2005 terms) and a house he owned in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico (his first house in Puerto Vallarta was lost to second wife Elizabeth Taylor during his first divorce from her).      Frankly told the press that he appeared in the movies Steiner - Das Eiserne Kreuz, 2. Teil (1979), Circle of Two (1981) and Lovespell (1981) (generally considered by critics to be three of his worse films, all of them critical and box office disasters that eroded the reputation he had recently fought back to reclaim with his appearance on stage and screen in Equus (1977)) for the money. Burton, who had effectively been cleaned out financially by his two divorces from second wife Elizabeth Taylor, was paid $750,000 for each picture (approximately $2.25 million in 2005 terms). Conversely, he was willing to appear in Absolution (1978) at the same time for one-sixth his fee as he believed in the project very strongly.      Burton and Warren Mitchell were Royal Air Force cadets together at Oxford in 1944. In the years 1944-1947, when both were demobilized, they were stationed together at times in Canada and back in England. Later, they appeared together in The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965).      In 1969, Richard Burton bought his second wife Elizabeth Taylor one of the world\'s largest diamonds from the jeweller Cartier after losing an auction for the 69-carat, pear-shaped stone to the jeweller, which was won with a $1 million bid. Aristotle Onassis also failed in his bid to win the diamond, which he intended to give his wife Jacqueline Kennedy. The rough diamond that would yield the prized stone weighed 244 carats and was found in 1966 at South Africa\'s Premier mine. Harry Winston cut and polished the diamond, which was put up for auction in 1969. Burton purchased the diamond from Cartier the next day for $1,069,000 (approximately $6 million in 2005 dollars) to give to Elizabeth Taylor. The small premium Cartier charged Burton was in recognition of the great publicity the jewellery garnered from selling the stone, which was dubbed the ""Burton-Cartier Diamond"", to the then-""world\'s most famous couple"". Ten years later, the twice-divorced-from-Burton Elizabeth Taylor herself auctioned off the ""Burton-Taylor Diamond"" to fund a hospital in Botswana. The last recorded sale of the ""Burton-Taylor Diamond"" was in 1979 for nearly $3,000,000 to an anonymous buyer in Saudi Arabia. The ring was the centre of the classic Here\'s Lucy (1968) episode ""Lucy Meets the Burtons"" in 1970, in which Lucy Carter, played by Lucille Ball, gets the famous ring stuck on her finger. The actual ring was used and the episode was the highest rated episode of the very popular series.Marlon Brando became quite friendly with Burton\'s wife Elizabeth Taylor while shooting Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967). Marlon Brando agreed to pick up her Best Actress Award for Who\'s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) from the New York Film Critics Circle. When Marlon Brando made his appearance at the NYFCC Award ceremony at Sardi\'s on January 29, 1967, he hectored the critics, querying them as to why they hadn\'t recognized Elizabeth Taylor before. He then flew to Dahomey, Africa where Elizabeth Taylor was shooting The Comedians (1967) with Burton to personally deliver the award, a development Burton thought odd. Later in the 1960s, Marlon Brando\' socialised with the Burtons, visiting them on their famous yacht the Kalizma, while they plied the Mediterreanean. Marlon Brando\'s ex-wife Anna Kashfi, in her book ""Brando for Breakfast"" (1979), claimed that Marlon Brando and Burton got into a fist-fight aboard the yacht, probably over Elizabeth Taylor, but nothing of the incident appears in Burton\'s voluminous diaries. In his diaries, Burton found Marlon Brando to be quite intelligent but believed he suffered, like Elizabeth Taylor did, from becoming too famous too early in his life and believed their affinity for one another was based on this. (Both Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando would later befriend Michael Jackson, another superstar-cum-legend who had become too famous too soon.) Burton recognized Marlon Brando as a great actor, but felt he would have been more suited to silent films due to the deficiency in his voice (the famous ""mumble""). As a silent film star, Burton believed Marlon Brando would have been the greatest motion picture actor ever.      According to Burton\'s diaries, when he and Elizabeth Taylor appeared on the Here\'s Lucy (1968) (episode: ""Lucy Meets the Burtons""), he was appalled by the tedium of shooting the show. He found Lucille Ball\'s meticulous professionalism to be ludicrous as he felt it was out of place on a TV show. Lucy was entirely focused on making the show work, and Burton -- who thought it would be a lark -- didn\'t have any fun on the set. He was quite impressed by Ball\'s co-star Gale Gordon, but was dismayed that Lucy, personally, directed him to play his ""part"" -- which was himself, after all -- very broad so that he was shouting. When he did shout, she told him that he was finally playing comedy as it should be played. The episode featured Lucy meeting Burton, who was fleeing the press and hid in her office, and then Liz, and putting on Liz\'s 69-carat, pear-shaped stone diamond, which became stuck to her her finger.      Recorded his sessions for the Jeff Wayne\'s musical version of ""The War of the Worlds"" in two afternoon sessions in New York between film making.      Following the release of The Robe (1953), his first Hollywood production, the critics would accuse Burton of being a wooden film actor, a charge that would stay with him throughout his career. It was not until The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965) that critics would be unanimous in their praise of his performance, yet after an excellent five years his mastery of film technique had seemingly deserted him and much of his later work, such as Villain (1971) and Equus (1977), would be dismissed by many as overacting.      In November 1974, Burton was asked to write an article about Sir Winston Churchill for ""The New York Times"". Since Burton had just played the wartime leader in The Gathering Storm (1974), the newspaper expected a laudatory piece. Instead they were presented with a rant about Churchill the right-wing politician, whom Burton wrote, ""to know him is to hate him"".      He was a close friend of fellow Welsh actor Sir Stanley Baker from childhood, and provided the narration for Baker\'s epic film Zulu (1964).      He had smoked since he was eight, reaching five packs of cigarettes a day in middle age.      An article Burton wrote in memory of his longtime friend, Sir Stanley Baker, following the actor\'s death in June 1976, caused so much offence that Baker\'s widow, Lady Ellen Martin, considered suing Burton. However, shortly afterwards, she recalled standing near the tree where Baker\'s ashes had been scattered and hearing his voice saying, ""You know what Rich is like when he\'s in his cups"".      While starring as King Arthur in the musical ""Camelot"" in 1961, Burton told his co-star Julie Andrews that she was his only leading lady he had not slept with.Who\'s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) ran over schedule, causing Burton to pull out of Robbery (1967), which instead went to Stanley Baker.      He refused to attend his father\'s funeral in 1957.      He was a close friend of Humphrey Bogart.      While filming Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984), he suffered from a terrible pain in his neck and had to wear a neck brace during rehearsals. He had to wear heavy make up in the film, since the director felt he looked twenty years older than his age. He minimized his famous voice for the part of O\'Brien, although he had great difficulty remembering the lines and would sometimes require nearly forty takes to get a scene right. The result was one of his most critically acclaimed performances, and well as his most underplayed.      While playing Dr. Dysart in ""Equus"" on Broadway in 1976, Burton was so impressed by co-star Peter Firth that he offered to play the Friar with Firth as Romeo. Firth did play Romeo on stage, but Burton was not cast.      Underwent treatment for alcoholism at a clinic in America after filming Klansman (1974).      Met with Josip Broz Tito, whom he greatly admired, before starring in Sutjeska (1973).      Producer Dino De Laurentiis wanted Burton to play Napoleon Bonaparte in Waterloo (1970), but the role went to Rod Steiger instead.      After being forced to drop out of the touring production of ""Camelot"" in April 1981 in order to undergo major spinal surgery - during which his entire spinal column was found to be coated in crystallized alcohol - Burton contemplated retiring completely from acting, but later agreed to star in Wagner (1981).      Was offered the role of Thomas More in A Man for All Seasons (1966), but he turned the part down. Paul Scofield, who went on to win a Best Actor Oscar for his performance, was cast instead.      In the last seven years of his life he constantly resisted offers to play Lear on stage, instead preferring to make films like Absolution (1978).      He would often tell interviewers that he had played Hamlet on the London stage when he was 23. He was in fact nearly 28 at the time.      In 1981 he accepted a contract reported to be worth nearly $1 million over three years to use his voice in a series of commercials for an American magazine, ""Geo"".      His younger brother Graham Jenkins worked for the BBC and was responsible for getting Burton the job of narrating the Royal Wedding of \'Prince Charles\' and Princess Diana for BBC Radio on 29 July 1981. There had been some concern that Burton would say something controversial, given his past attacks on Churchill. However, as it turned out he made only one mistake during the five hour broadcast.      Was named ""The Worst Actor of All Time"" in Harry Medved and Michael Medved\'s 1980 book ""The Golden Turkey Awards"", beating out Victor Mature, John Agar, and Tony Curtis. In so naming Burton, the Medveds cited the preponderance of big-budget film flops he starred in, and the overall squandering of his acting potential for much of his career. Burton\'s The Assassination of Trotsky (1972) had been listed among ""The Fifty Worst Films of All Time,"" and Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977) was named the second-worst film of all time (behind Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959)) in the 1978 book of the same name by Harry Medved and Randy Lowell.      Was at one point going to star in Follow Me! (1972) with Elizabeth Taylor.      Like many Welshmen, where the game is more a national religion than a sport, Burton played rugby. He continued to play well into his early career, mainly at wing-forward. He only hung up his boots when contractual obligations to film and theatre producers forced him to do so.      According to his biography ""And God Created Burton"", he was a notorious womanizer; during his marriage to Sybil Williams he had affairs with Claire Bloom, Jean Simmons, Maggie McNamara, Lee Remick, Lana Turner and Mary Ure, and during his marriage to Elizabeth Taylor he had affairs with Geneviève Bujold, Nathalie Delon and Raquel Welch.      His attack on Sir Winston Churchill in 1974 was widely thought to have been occasioned by the fact that he was, at the time, engaged to Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia - who was, of course, a princess in exile. She blamed Churchill and other western leaders for giving away her country to the Communists at the end of World War II. Burton\'s engagement to her was soon broken off.      He was well-known for his many acts of extraordinary generosity. For example, during the filming of crowd scenes for ""Wagner"", he noted that one of the extras would, during breaks in shooting, be in constant floods of tears. He discreetly inquired the reason for this and was told that she was newly-widowed and penniless and had taken the job as an extra in a desperate bid to raise money to pay her mortgage. That same week, she found that her mortgage had been paid off in full by Burton, to whom she had never even spoken.      Received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on March 1, 2013 at 6336 Hollywood Boulevard, next to Elizabeth Taylor\'s star.      Had a brother Ivor.      Guy Masterson was his great nephew.      He was passionate about books and was a voracious reader.      According to his listing in Quinlan\'s Film Stars published 2000, the film Lovespell (1981) aka Tristan and Isolte was made in 1979 and was unreleased.      Although his death was sudden, it was not much of a surprise to those who knew him. Burton\'s health had been declining for several years prior to his death, and he suffered from constant and severe neck pain. He had been warned that his liver was enlarged as early as March 1970, and had been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and kidney disease in April 1981 due to alcoholism. He had a brush with death during the shooting of Klansman (1974) when he nearly drank himself to death. Burton was dried out at Saint John\'s Health Center in Santa Monica, California.      Has appeared in six films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: The Robe (1953), The Longest Day (1962), Cleopatra (1963), Becket (1964), Who\'s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) and Anne of the Thousand Days (1969).      He has two roles in common with Sidney James: (1) Burton played Mark Antony in Cleopatra (1963) while James played him in Carry on Cleo (1964) and (2) Burton played King Henry VIII of England in Anne of the Thousand Days (1969) while James played him in Carry on Henry (1971). In both cases, James wore the costume which had originally been worn by Burton.      Is one of 13 actors who have received an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of a real-life king. The others in chronological order are Charles Laughton for The Private Life of Henry VIII. (1933), Robert Morley for Marie Antoinette (1938), Basil Rathbone for If I Were King (1938), Laurence Olivier for The Chronicle History of King Henry the Fifth with His Battell Fought at Agincourt in France (1944) and Richard III (1955), José Ferrer for Joan of Arc (1948), Yul Brynner for The King and I (1956), John Gielgud for Becket (1964), Peter O\'Toole for Becket (1964) and The Lion in Winter (1968), Robert Shaw for A Man for All Seasons (1966), Kenneth Branagh for Henry V (1989), Nigel Hawthorne for The Madness of King George (1994), and Colin Firth for The King\'s Speech (2010).      According to his younger brother Graham Jenkins, Burton smoked at least 100 cigarettes a day, although Penny Junor\'s biography said he habitually smoked around 60 cigarettes a day. He gave up smoking for a time in 1980 after encouragement from his third wife.      He was accused of racism over remarks he made during a visit to South Africa.      His last surviving sibling, younger brother Graham Jenkins, died in December 2015 aged 88.      In a 1977 interview with Vincent Kane, describing a five-year period which he barely remembers because of his heavy drinking, Burton recounts introducing himself to \'a very distinguished actor... an American\' at a party and the other actor replying, \'Kid, we did a film together! Lasted four months!\' The gravelly voice he puts on sounds very like that of Lee Marvin, with whom he made Klansman (1974) shortly before drying out.      He always wore built up shoes in films and in real life.Where Eagles Dare (1968) was his last major hit at the box office. The Wild Geese (1978) was successful in Europe but completely flopped in North America.      Mentioned in the song ""GMF"" by John Grant: ""Half of the time I think I\'m in some movie, I play the underdog of course / I wonder who they\'ll get to play me, maybe they could dig up Richard Burton\'s corpse"".      He had an excellent memory and had no difficulty remembering lines until he was fifty. However when he starred in ""Equus"" on Broadway in 1976 he had great difficulty learning the lines. Burton had not acted on stage for twelve years. He turned down offers to play ""King Lear"" on stage in Canada in 1978 and 1983 because he said he could no longer remember lines.      In Italy for the filming of Cleopatra (1963), he became so frustrated with the numerous delays during its production, he begged Darryl F. Zanuck for a part in the Longest Day just so he could do some work.and was given a cameo role of an RAF pilot. Roddy McDowall who was also filming Cleopatra did the same and ended up with a small role as an American soldier.      According to his listing in Quinlan\'s Film Stars published 2000 the film Lovespell aka Tristan and Isolte was made in 1979 and was unreleased.      His film performances were often criticized for lacking emotion.      By 1967 he had bursitis, arthritis and dermatitis.Personal Quotes (81)      When I played drunks I had to remain sober because I didn\'t know how to play them when I was drunk.      [replying to a cable from Laurence Olivier at the height of the Cleopatra (1963) scandal: ""Make up your mind, dear heart. Do you want to be a great actor or a household word?""] Both.      I\'ve done the most awful rubbish in order to have somewhere to go in the morning.      My father considered that anyone who went to chapel and didn\'t drink alcohol was not to be tolerated. I grew up in that belief.      [in 1963, about adultery] The minute you start fiddling around outside the idea of monogamy, nothing satisfies anymore.      I\'ve played the lot: a homosexual, a sadistic gangster, kings, princes, a saint, the lot. All that\'s left is a Carry On film. My last ambition.      I have to think hard to name an interesting man who does not drink.      My father said all actors were homosexuals. That is nonsense, of course. But perhaps most actors are latent homosexuals and we cover it with drink. I was a homosexual once, but not for long. But I tried it. It didn\'t work so I gave it up. (1975)      I rather like my reputation, actually, that of a spoiled genius from the Welsh gutter, a drunk, a womanizer; it\'s rather an attractive image.      You may be as vicious about me as you please. You will only do me justice.      [asked why he refused to see his performance in Cleopatra (1963)] Well, I don\'t want to kill myself.      The only thing in life is language. Not love. Not anything else.      All I wanted to do was to live, pick up a new Jag, and act at the Old Vic.      All great art comes from people who are either ugly or have a terrible inferiority complex. I know no one who is beautiful and produces art.      [about Elizabeth Taylor] Elizabeth has great worries about becoming a cripple because her feet sometimes have no feeling in them. She asked if I would stop loving her if she had to spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair. I told her that I didn\'t care if her legs, bum and bosoms fell off and her teeth turned yellow. And she went bald. I love that woman so much sometimes that I cannot believe my luck. She has given me so much.      [about his love of reading] Home is where the books are.      [about being hired to play Marc Antony opposite Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra (1963)] Well, I suppose I must don a breastplate once more to play opposite Miss Tits.      [on Elizabeth Taylor] I might run from her for a thousand years and she is still my baby child. Our love is so furious that we burn each other out.      [on Elizabeth Taylor] At thirty-four she is an extremely beautiful woman, lavishly endowed by nature with a few flaws in the masterpiece: She has an insipid double chin, her legs are too short and she has a slight potbelly. She has a wonderful bosom, though.      A man that hoards up riches and enjoys them not, is like an ass that carries gold and eats thistles.      Richard Burton is now my epitaph, my cross, my title, my image. I have achieved a kind of diabolical fame. It has nothing to do with my talents as an actor. That counts for little now. I am the diabolically famous Richard Burton.      An actor is something less than a man, while an actress is something more than a woman.      Certainly most movie executives were making love to the starlets. But then, so were most of us actors.      [in 1974] I was up to, I\'m told, because, of course, you don\'t remember if you drink that much, about two-and-a-half to three bottles of hard liquor a day. Fascinating idea, of course, drink on that scale. It\'s rather nice to have gone through it and to have survived.      [on Elizabeth Taylor] The most astonishingly self-contained, pulchritudinous, remote, removed, inaccessible woman I had ever seen.      [on Frankie Howerd] If I had his talent, I\'d drop Shakespeare tomorrow.      [on Staircase (1969)] I believe in this film absolutely. It is a kick against the system.      [in 1962] And I\'m too old. I\'m now thirty-six. And I look about 5\'2"". I\'m 5\'10"" but I look smaller. It\'s because I\'m so wide or my head\'s too big or something.      [on Elizabeth Taylor] I love her, not for her breasts, her buttocks or her knees but for her mind. It is inscrutable. She is like a poem.      [on Sophia Loren] She is as beautiful as an erotic dream. Tall and extremely large-bosomed. Tremendously long legs. They go up to her shoulders, practically. Beautiful brown eyes, set in a marvelously vulpine, almost satanic, face.      [in 1984] I still smoke too much. I think it gives my voice an edge.      (on Julie Andrews, his co-star in ""Camelot""] Every man I know who knows her is a little bit in love with her.      I almost replaced Sean Connery as James Bond in Thunderball (1965). This was before Sean played Bond. My friend, the Irish producer Kevin McClory, wanted me. Kevin worked for Michael Todd on Around the World in Eighty Days (1956) and I was impressed with his Irish rebelliousness. We Welsh have that, too, but not quite like the Irish, who transfuse it into their blood on the same day they are born. McClory promised [Alfred Hitchcock] would direct and I had great hopes for the project. It fell through, of course - and later Kevin made a bloody fortune, when Sean was Bond. I wonder sometimes how it might all have turned out. [Ian Fleming] was big on me for the role. Stewart Granger was next in line.      I\'m a reader, you know. I was corrupted by Faust. And [William Shakespeare]. And Marcel Proust]. And ]Ernest Hemingway]. But mostly I was corrupted by Dylan Thomas. Most people see me as a rake, womanizer, boozer and purchaser of large baubles. I\'m all those things depending on the prism and the light. But mostly I\'m a reader. Give me Agatha Christie for an hour and I\'m happy as a clam. The house in Celigny some day will cave in under its own weight from the books. I hope I\'m there when it does. One hundred six years old. Investigating the newest thriller from [John le Carré] or a new play from Tennessee Williams.      I played a sex-drenched doctor in The Bramble Bush (1960). It was the worst picture I ever made, if you don\'t count Ice Palace (1960). That one was based upon a very weak novel by Edna Ferber. Both pictures for Warner Brothers. Jack L. Warner told the press I had no sex appeal. Then Elizabeth came along. All changed after that. Suddenly, Eddie Fisher didn\'t have sex appeal. And I did. It\'s a crazy world for a Welsh coal miner\'s son born in November 1925.Albert Finney is the greatest actor in the world. Then Peter O\'Toole. [Marlon Brando]. [Laurence Olivier] and [John Gielgud] belong to another time and place. They\'re immortal, but remote from the rest of us. Sean Connery is vastly underrated. I would like to do a play with Michael Caine, whom I respect. I like Alan Bates. Frank Finlay is a hard man to follow in the second act. Unbeatable self-discipline.      [on Alexander the Great (1956)] I knew all epics are crap but I felt this one could be different. How could I have been so wrong?      God put me on this earth to raise sheer hell.      Once you have a drink problem, you always have one. Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic. But, er, I\'m not quite sure whether I am one or not. I think I\'m within striking distance of being one. (1977)      The unfortunate thing is that everyone wants me to play a prince or a king ... I\'m always wearing a nightdress or a short skirt or something odd. I don\'t want to do them, I don\'t like them, I hate getting made up for them, I hate my hair being curled in the mornings, I hate tights, I hate boots, I hate everything. I\'d like to be in a lounge suit, I\'d like to be a sort of Welsh Rex Harrison and do nothing except lounge against a bar with a gin and tonic in my hand. (1963)      I am the son of a Welsh miner and one would expect me to be at my happiest playing peasants, people of the earth. But in actual fact I\'m much happier playing princes and kings. Now whether this is a kind of sublimation of what I would like to be, or something like that, I don\'t know, but certainly I\'m never really very comfortable playing people from the working class. (1967)      If you\'re going to make rubbish, be the best rubbish in it. I keep telling Larry Olivier that. I chided Olivier for playing a minor role in an epic like Spartacus (1960), which he\'s just done. Larry had a dressing room half the size of Tony Curtis\' in that film. And he got about half Curtis\' money. Well, that\'s ridiculous. You\'ve got to swank in Hollywood. When I go there I demand two Cadillacs - one for my family - and the best dressing room in the studio. Of course I\'m not worth it, but it impresses them.      Rubbish ... tastelessly sentimental and badly acted by me. - On The Robe (1953)      As the seventh son of a Welsh miner I knew hardship first hand. I come from the lower depths of the working class. It\'s true that I now earn one and a quarter of a million dollars per picture, and it sounds strange to say that at heart I am a Communist, but there is no contradiction because I don\'t exploit others.      It seems fairly ridiculous for someone of forty-five or fifty to be learning words written by other people, most of which are bad, to make a few dollars.      I\'m not dedicated, I never was. In a sense I\'m totally alienated from the craft that I employ so superficially and successfully. (1970)      I get increasingly disenchanted with acting ... as the years totter past I find it ludicrous, learning some idiot\'s lines in the small hours of the night so I can stay a millionaire. (1972)      One big picture is worth ten small ones. The actor who is fortunate enough to get two or possibly three big subjects a year benefits from their long runs. He\'s never absent long from public view.      My real interest in life is the theatre, and I think I\'ve shot my bolt in London as far as the classical roles are concerned. I\'ve played all the parts I think I can play, and one or two that I should have given a miss. But there is nothing left until I\'m older and can play parts like Lear. (1957)      Actors go through cycles - remarkable, weird cycles. There was one period from 1956 to 1961 or so when I couldn\'t do anything right. My voice went foul, my luck was bad, I chose badly. I thought I had lost what I had, and I nearly retired right then and there.      I\'ve been in trouble all my life, I\'ve done the most unutterable rubbish, all because of money. I didn\'t need it - I\'ve never needed money, even as a child, though I came from a very poor family. But there have been times when the lure of the zeros was simply too great.      As Lee Marvin says, who gives a shit? We\'re born, we come staggering out the womb, we come searching for death. My father was a Welsh miner, a remarkable man. Tough, powerful. Obese. Short. I come from an enormous family - thirteen children. My eldest sister was having a baby. I didn\'t understand it. I said, \'Will she be all right? Will she live?\' My father - he was massively drunk - was worried too. \'Never mind,\' he said, \'we\'re all dying.\' He talked like an angel. \'Even your growing pains are reaching into oblivion.\'      Last Tango in Paris [Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972)] so absolutely revolted and embarrassed me that I didn\'t know where to look ... I said, \'I\'m sorry, I can\'t stand it, I have to go. It did not turn me on, it turned me off. For a month I was asexual.      My friends are not actors, they are scientists, they are writers. My real gift is writing.      You can\'t be at the mercy of fate, you\'ve got to invest so you don\'t ever need to work again.The Robe (1953) was lousy, but an almighty hit. I was dull as ditchwater and an almighty flop. My next film, Prince of Players (1955), was Hollywood\'s first turkey in CinemaScope - when CinemaScope was new and hotter than a pistol. If I\'d been able to buttonhole a couple of relatives and persuade a few of the deluded girls I\'d done favours for, I\'d still have struggled to rustle up nine lost souls to form a fan club.      I have a fair choice of women myself if I wish. But I don\'t wish it. Since Elizabeth, I have seen two. I\'ve a fundamental and basic loyalty. Next year I\'ll be fifty and I\'ve only been married twice. Yes, I betrayed them both a couple of times, but not mentally, only physically. You see, I may fall in love and it may last six months, but then the affair breaks up. (1974)      None of my films has done me any good. I know all epics are awful, but I thought Alexander the Great (1956) might be the first good one. I was wrong. They cut it about - played down to the audience. I say if the audience doesn\'t understand, let \'em stay ignorant.      Although I like to be thought of as a tough rugby-playing Welsh miner\'s son, able to take on the world, the reality is that this image is just superficial. I am the reverse of what people think.      I drank too much, smoked too much and made love too much.      I have always felt that the camera hasn\'t liked me. I\'m a stage animal. I have to be big and loud, and the camera needs you to be small and naturalistic and subtle; much more naturalistic. I\'m as subtle as a buffalo stampede.Marlon Brando has yet to learn to speak. He should have been born two generations before and acted in silent films.      I got away from the valley and proceeded to drink myself to death elsewhere.      You haven\'t heard the real beauty of the Bible until you have heard it in Welsh.      Marc Antony is one of the great roles because it combines some of the best dialogue Shakespeare ever wrote and action; Antony was a man of action.      Shakespeare [is] the best way to learn English.      Generally if you mention the word Shakespeare in Hollywood, everybody leaves the room.      Everywhere you go, there\'s somewhere shoving a chair under your bum, and if you take out a cigarette there are eighty-four people jumping up to light it and tell you how wonderful you are. And you know it\'s not true.      [on Marlon Brando, November, 1966]: He is a genuinely good man, I suspect, and he is intelligent. He has depth. It\'s no accident that he is such a compelling actor. He puts on acts, of course, and pretends to be vaguer than he is. Very little misses him, as I\'ve noticed.      [on Marlon Brando, July, 1970]: He really is a smugly pompous little bastard and is cavalier about everybody except Black Panthers and Indians.      [on Geneviève Bujold]: I\'d hate to be her next director or leading man. I think she firmly believes herself to be the legitimate heir to Rachelle or Bernhardt or Duse. She has all the power of a gnat. A dying one. I could whisper louder than her screams.      If I had a chance for another life, I would certainly choose a better complexion.      You reach the top of the heap, but it\'s a circle, and you slip on the down side; maybe for years. You get scared. (1982)      The learned doctors told me if I continued to booze I should be prepared to welcome the end.      I\'m more aware than I used to be of the tedium of acting. (1984)      Actors are poor, abject, disagreeable, perverse, ill-minded, slightly malicious creatures. And of that august company of idiots, I\'m afraid I\'m a member.      Having discovered sex, I began looting and plundering it with great delight.      Stripped, I am monstrous.      I have achieved a sort of diabolical fame.      In the course of preparing myself ... I realized afresh that I hate Churchill and all of his kind. I hate them virulently. They have stalked down the corridors of endless power all through history ... What man of sanity would say on hearing of the atrocities committed by the Japanese against British and Anzac prisoners of war, \'We shall wipe them out, every one of them, men, women, and children. There shall not be a Japanese left on the face of the earth.\'? Such simple-minded cravings for revenge leave me with a horrified but reluctant awe for such single-minded and merciless ferocity.      I gave it a try once ... Intimacy with a man. How can you know you don\'t like caviar if you never tried it?Salary (27)My Cousin Rachel\xa0(1952)      $50,000       Alexander the Great\xa0(1956)      $100,000       Look Back in Anger\xa0(1959)      $100,000       Ice Palace\xa0(1960)      $125,000       The Bramble Bush\xa0(1960)      $125,000       The Longest Day\xa0(1962)      $30,000       The V.I.P.s\xa0(1963)      $500,000       Cleopatra\xa0(1963)      $250,000       The Night of the Iguana\xa0(1964)      $500,000       The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\xa0(1965)      $750,000       The Sandpiper\xa0(1965)      $500,000 + % of gross      Who\'s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\xa0(1966)      $750,000 + % of gross      The Comedians\xa0(1967)      $750,000       Boom\xa0(1968)      $1,000,000 + % of gross      Candy\xa0(1968)      $50 .000 plus points      Where Eagles Dare\xa0(1968)      $1,000,000 plus percentage of gross      Staircase\xa0(1969)      $1,250,000 + % of gross      Anne of the Thousand Days\xa0(1969)      $1 m plus percentage of gross      Raid on Rommel\xa0(1971)      $1,000,000       Brief Encounter\xa0(1974)      $600,000       Exorcist II: The Heretic\xa0(1977)      $1,000,000       Equus\xa0(1977)      $500,000       The Medusa Touch\xa0(1978)      $500,000       Absolution\xa0(1978)      $125,000       Circle of Two\xa0(1981)      $750,000       Lovespell\xa0(1981)      $750,000       Wagner\xa0(1981)      $1,000,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nJames Mason ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 82 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(2)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(2)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(44)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(29)  Overview (4)Date of Birth15\xa0May1909,\xa0Huddersfield, Yorkshire [now in Kirklees, West Yorkshire], England, UK Date of Death27\xa0July1984,\xa0Lausanne, Vaud, Switzerland      \xa0(heart attack)    Birth NameJames Neville MasonHeight5\'\xa011""\xa0(1.8\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          James Mason was a great English actor of British and American films. He was born in Yorkshire, and attended Marlborough and Cambridge, where he discovered acting on a lark, and abandoned a planned career as an architect. Following work in stock companies, he joined the Old Vic under the guidance of Sir Tyrone Guthrie and of Alexander Korda, who gave Mason at least one small film role in 1933, but fired him a few days into shooting. Mason remained in the theatre becoming a prominent stage actor, meanwhile getting first small, then rapidly larger roles in ""quota quickies"", minor films made to accommodate laws mandating a certain percentage of films shown in Britain to be British-made. Mason\'s talent for playing protagonists of a decidedly hard-bitten or melancholy stripe brought him from these minor films to a position as one of Britain\'s major film stars of the 1940s. When, late in that decade, he came to America, he played somewhat more glamorous or heroic roles than he had been accustomed to in Britain, but he remained a dynamic and intelligent force on the screen. His tendency to take any job offered led him to have many unworthy credits on his resume but, throughout his career, he remained a respected and powerful figure in the industry. His mellifluous voice and an uncanny ability to suggest rampant emotion beneath a face of absolute calm made him a fascinating performer to watch. He died of a heart attack in 1984 at his home in Switzerland.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net>          Spouse (2) Clarissa Kaye-Mason (13 August\xa01971            - 27 July\xa01984)\xa0(his death)           Pamela Mason (22 February\xa01941            - 31 August\xa01964)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(2 children)          Trade Mark (2)        Sophisticated upper-class demeanor        Deep mellifluous voiceTrivia (44)      He should not be confused with the American actor Jim Mason (1889-1959), aka James Mason, who appeared in silent films, particularly Westerns in the 1920s and 1930s.      Had been considered for the role of Harry Lime on the television series The Third Man (1959), but Michael Rennie ended up in the role.      An avowed pacifist, he refused to perform military service during World War II, a stance that caused his family to break with him for many years.      Father of Morgan Mason and actress/scriptwriter Portland Mason.      Was responsible for getting an unknown actor from New Zealand his first major film role. That actor was Sam Neill.      Was scheduled to play James Bond 007 in a 1958 television adaptation of ""From Russia with Love"", which was ultimately never produced. Later, despite being in his 50s, Mason was a contender to play Bond in Dr. No (1962) before Sean Connery was cast.      Turned down the role of Hugo Drax in the James Bond film Moonraker (1979), which went to Michael Lonsdale.      In 1952 while remodeling his home, he discovered several reels of Buster Keaton\'s ""lost"" films (Mason had purchased Keaton\'s Hollywood mansion) and immediately recognized their historical significance and was responsible for their preservation.      Has starred with his wife Clarissa Kaye-Mason in the original Salem\'s Lot (1979). They appeared together in the film Age of Consent (1969).      He was offered the role of Lawyer Crosby in the horror film The Cat and the Canary (1978). However, the gender of the role was changed to female and was played by Wendy Hiller.      Told Playboy magazine in the late 1970s that he hated rock \'n\' roll but loved country music.      Can be seen visiting the set of Stanley Kubrick\'s The Shining (1980) in Vivian Kubrick\'s TV documentary Making \'The Shining\' (1980). Stanley Kubrick did not usually allow visitors to his set, but made an exception for Mason, who had memorably played Humbert Humbert for him in Lolita (1962).      Was the original choice to play Professor Kingsfield in The Paper Chase (1973), but had to turn down the role due to poor health. John Houseman, who had acted in only one other movie in a small role, was cast and won an Oscar.      Was rejected by fellow student Alistair Cooke for an acting role whilst at Cambridge. Cooke asked Mason what course he was studying. ""Architecture"", replied Mason. ""Then I think you should finish your degree and forget about acting."" advised Cooke, in one of his rare lapses of judgment.Eddie Izzard often uses an impression of James Mason in his stand-up comedy routines as the voice of a confused, dithering God.      Was offered the role of Viktor Komarovsky in Doctor Zhivago (1965) by double-Oscar winning director David Lean after Marlon Brando failed to respond to director Lean\'s written inquiry into whether he wanted to play the role. Mason initially accepted the role. Lean decided on Mason, who was a generation older than Brando, as he did not want an actor who would overpower the character of Yuri Zhivago (specifically, to show Zhivago up as a lover of Lara, who would be played by the young Julie Christie, which the charismatic Brando might have done, shifting the sympathy of the audience). Mason eventually dropped out and Rod Steiger, who had just won the Silver Bear as Best Actor for his role as the eponymous The Pawnbroker (1964), accepted the role.      11 years after being mentioned in Rope (1948) as making an excellent villain, he was finally cast by Alfred Hitchcock as such in North by Northwest (1959).      He refused to wear make-up.      He suffered a severe heart attack in 1959.      Grandfather of actor James Duke Mason.      Reportedly, he once saved the life of Max Bygraves\' son Anthony. Max Bygraves and his son Anthony were at a party at Judy Garland\'s house. Anthony fell into the pool and Max did not notice. James Mason did notice and, fully clothed, he jumped into the water and pulled Anthony out.      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6821 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on February 8, 1960.      Mason lived with future wife Pamela Kellino and husband Roy, and even after Mason married her, Kellino continued to live with them.      At Liza Minnelli\'s request, Mason read the eulogy at Judy Garland\'s funeral.      Mason was set to make his screen debut in The Private Life of Don Juan (1934), Douglas Fairbanks\' final film, but was replaced after four days supposedly because of unsuitable casting.      Was among the various actors in the running for the role of Hans Fallanda in the science fiction horror film Lifeforce (1985); Frank Finlay won the role.      Following his death, he was interred at Corvey-Sur-Vevey Cemetery in Corvey-Sur-Vevey, Switzerland.      Mason insisted that all biographical information in Clive Hirschhorn\'s book, ""The Films of James Mason,"" even the introductory notes. He wouldn\'t even allow his birth date to be used.      Mason\'s first screen appearance in ""The Private Life of Don Juan,"" was the last for its star, Douglas Fairbanks although the fledgling actor was replaced after several days work because he was unsuitably cast.      James and Pamela Mason arrived in the U.S. in November, 1946, but he became embroiled in a legal battle with David E, Rose, who claimed the actor had agreed to form a production company with him. After eighteen months Mason eventually won the case.      Mason had committed to recreating his role for the TV pilot of ""The Verdict,"" but his death caused the project to be abandoned.      In a January 6, 1947 ""Life"" magazine article Mason claimed he preferred jazz and Duke Ellington to classical music and his favorite stars were Spencer Tracy, Jean Gabin, Lena Horne, Carmen Miranda, and Veronica Lake.      The actor thought the 1937 Janet Gaynor/Fredric March version of ""A Star Is Born"" was superior to his and Garland\'s because the musical numbers detracted from the story.      Although Mason\'s son Morgan is a film producer, he did work in the Reagan White House.      Stated that the reason he could not find a publisher for his autobiography, ""Before I Forget"" was because his memoir was ""... too polite."".      Mason and wife Pamela were cat lovers and collaborated on a book on their cats.      Was able to do uncanny impressions of John Gielgud and Gabriel Pascal.      Although somehow he was never given a much-deserved knighthood, he was awarded the Golden Seal, England\'s most prestigious film honor.      Mason\'s daughter Portland was named for comedian Fred Allen\'s wife.      Critic Vincent Canby said about Mason: ""He is, in fact, one of the very few film actors worth taking the trouble to see even when the film that encase him is so much cement"".      Mason admitted to journalists that he had only taken a part in Mandingo (1975) because he was behind with alimony payments, leading critic Roger Ebert to reply, \'surely jail would have been better\'.      Reportedly, he once saved the life of Max Bygraves\' son Patrick. Max Bygraves and his son were at a party at Judy Garland\'s house. Patrick fell into the pool and Max didn\'t notice. James Mason did and, fully clothed, he jumped into the water and pulled Patrick out.      Performed the role of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in two films. First in 1951 with ""The Desert Fox"" and followed in 1953 with ""The Desert Rats"".      He appeared in four films directed by Sidney Lumet: The Deadly Affair (1966), The Sea Gull (1968), Child\'s Play (1972) and The Verdict (1982).Personal Quotes (29)      [From Bill Fairchild] In a noisy world, he spoke quietly and, yet, his voice will be remembered by millions who never knew him.      How do I wish to be remembered, if at all? I think perhaps just as a fairly desirable sort of character actor.      I\'m a character actor: the public never knows what it\'s getting by way of a Mason performance from one film to the next. I therefore represent a thoroughly insecure investment.      [on not showing up at the 27th Academy Awards, even though he had been nominated as Best Actor for A Star Is Born (1954) and had agreed to go] The Oscar show is always a little better when things go wrong, so I had no need to feel guilty about letting them down.      [1970 comment on Jean Renoir] He\'s my style. Renoir\'s good for actors. Renoir obviously loves actors and understands actors, and La Grande Illusion (1937), which I saw recently, is so modern that it could have been made this year - the acting and the staging of it are absolutely modern and true.      [on Sir Carol Reed] He was always a director who got as much out of actors as could possibly be gotten. And he could stage individual scenes as well as they could possibly be staged. If he had a weakness, which I admit he has, it was that he didn\'t have a sufficiently keen story sense.      I purposely would not go and see the old version of Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941). They told me my part was played by Claude Rains, for whom I have an infinite admiration, and I knew I would never be as good as him.      [on Joseph L. Mankiewicz] A Letter to Three Wives (1949) and All About Eve (1950) were marvelous films. I thought that the last good film he made was 5 Fingers (1952), because personally I have not seen a Mankiewicz film that appeared to be well-directed since then. For instance, Cleopatra (1963) was a hideous film but nevertheless you could see that it had some good, well-written scenes and the director had not served the writer well.      Having been fascinated by the Alan Ladd phenomenon, I now had the opportunity to study it at close quarters. It turned out that he had the exquisite coordination and rhythm of an athlete, which made it a pleasure to watch him when he was being at all physical.      [on Alfred Hitchcock] You can see from the way he uses actors that he sees them as animated props. He casts his films very, very carefully and he knows perfectly well in advance that all the actors that he chooses are perfectly capable of playing the parts he gives them, without any special directorial effort on his part. He gets some sort of a charge out of directing the leading ladies, I think, but that\'s something else.      [on Judy Garland] In some of her films she showed talent which was very comic and touching. Touching because she played with a bright smile and a great spirit, while the situation was rather dramatic, even tragic perhaps. She had in fact a quality which can only be compared to Charles Chaplin\'s heartbreaking quality: always optimistic, always gay, always inventive, against poverty, against desperate situations - and that\'s when Judy is at her best.      [on Bette Davis] The greatest actress of all time.      [on Max Ophüls] I think I know the reason why producers tend to make him cry. Inevitably, they demand some stationary set-ups, and a shot that does not call for tracks is agony for dear poor Max, who, separated from his dolly, is wrapped in deepest melancholy. Once, when they took away his crane, I thought he\'d never smile again...      I loved Max Ophüls because he had a very unsuccessful career as far as America was concerned, but he had an irrepressible spirit. He was a brave, resilient man and a great man of theatre and he loved his work, he had an undying enthusiasm. He was a lovely man.      [on Raquel Welch] I have never met someone so badly behaved.Walter Wanger was a man who always wanted to be European. He didn\'t know how to be European but he wanted to be European, so The Reckless Moment (1949) was rather the kind of film - I suppose, like Brief Encounter (1945) - that he was trying to make, but it wasn\'t very good.      [on Rudolph Valentino] That Valentino was certainly a very splendid fellow. And his unique glamor was not entirely due to the fact that he was unhampered by banal dialogue. Modern dialogue is not always banal, and the screen hero who could match Valentino\'s posturing technique with an equally polished vocal technique has a perfectly fair chance of becoming his romantic peer. It was his magnetism and dignity that assured him a peak of magnificent isolation.      [on Louella Parsons] Not a bad old slob.      The trouble with Hollywood is that the producers and agents are the aristocrats... which made actors who make their living in Hollywood usually feel they are some sort of scum. They looked for other means of showing off and were great on rallies for political candidates.      [from his eulogy for Judy Garland] I traveled in her orbit only for a little while but it was an exciting while, and one during which it seemed that the joys in her life outbalanced the miseries. The little girl whom I knew, who had a little curl in the middle of her forehead, when she was good she was not only very, very good, she was the most sympathetic, the funniest, the sharpest and the most stimulating woman I ever knew. She was a lady who gave so much and richly, both to her vast audience who she entertained and to the friends around her whom she loved, that there was no currency in which to repay her. And she needed to be repaid, she needed devotion and love beyond the resources of any of us.      To be a successful film star, as opposed to a successful film actor, you should settle for an image and polish it forever. I somehow could never quite bring myself to do that.      Though it is hard for anyone familiar with the current television scene to imagine, the early days of television in the United States were really exciting.      [on his only meeting with Ronald Reagan] I only met Reagan once, at a time when I was just fading from Hollywood. I bumped into him at a jewelry store and took the liberty of introducing myself - under the guise of congratulating him on becoming Governor of California. He was very charming.      It has always seemed to me the height of audacity to write an autobiography unless, of course the author has made a contribution to history.      [on his independent production of ""Charade""] I had hoped that this curiosity would be lost without trace.      [on Candlelight in Algeria (1944) in 1974] This film topped the popularity polls in Bulgaria one or more of the immediately post-war years. I, who saw the film, find this interesting.      [on The Seventh Veil (1945) in 1974] This was Sydney Box\'s and Ann Todd\'s film. But director Compton Bennett and I also profited from its success. \'Welcome\' mats were spread out for us in Hollywood.      [on The Man in Grey (1943) in 1974] The great theatre critic James Agate, who was then writing in films, sensibly headed his review ""Bosh and Tosh.""      [on The Man Between (1953)] This film became very big on television in the U.S. In the cinema one demands of a thriller that the narrative thread be ever taut. The American televiewer makes no such demands since continuity is destined to be shattered by commercial interruption. Thus it often happens that what has been hitherto regarded as a failure in the cinemas will be a hit on the Late Late Show and vice versa.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nRobert Newton ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 27 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(4)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(17)\xa0|Salary\xa0(1)  Overview (4)Date of Birth1\xa0June1905,\xa0Shaftesbury, Dorset, England, UK Date of Death25\xa0March1956,\xa0Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California, USA      \xa0(heart attack)    Birth NameRobert Guy NewtonHeight6\'\xa0(1.83\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Robert Newton was one of the great character actors -- and great characters -- of the British cinema, best remembered today for playing Long John Silver in Treasure Island (1950) and its sequel for Walt Disney in the 1950s. His portrayal of Long John Silver and of Blackbeard, the Pirate (1952) created a persona that was so indelible that his vocal intonations created the paradigm for scores of people who want to ""Talk Like a Pirate."" The performance overshadows Newton\'s legacy, which is based on many first-rate performances in such movies as This Happy Breed (1944), Odd Man Out (1947) and Oliver Twist (1948), where his Bill Sykes is truly chilling. Oliver Reed, who played Sykes in the Oscar-winning movie musical Oliver! (1968) was influenced by Newton.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Jon C.

He often found himself unemployable due to his unreliability. He died at age 50 of alcohol-related causes although the official report was a heart attack.      Was voted one of the top ten British money-making stars in the Motion Picture Herald-Fame Poll from 1947 to 1951.      Married four times and had three children: Sally, an actress, Nicholas and Kim.      Was assistant stage manager and painting scenery at the Birmingham Repertory Company as a teenager. He made his debut there in a production of ""Captain Brassbound\'s Conversion"" (1920). Became a stage star when Noel Coward cast him in the popular musical revue ""Bitter Sweet"" which ran for over a year at Her Majesty\'s Theatre. Later Coward had Newton take over from Laurence Olivier in his classic play ""Private Lives"" in New York.      From an artistic family. His mother was a writer and father a painter and member of the Royal Academy. His brother and sister were also painters.      The voice of Captain McAllister in The Simpsons (1989) is based on his portrayal of Long John Silver.      Often credited with originating the style of speech generally equated with pirates. After his spectacular turn as Long John Silver in the Disney version of Treasure Island (1950), actors playing pirates in film, radio, television, and theatre, all tended to use (and still use) the same pseudo-Cornish accent Newton came up with.      Was declared bankrupt in his absence on September 24th 1954 at the London Bankruptcy Buildings. He owed a total of £46,300 to the Inland Revenue in unpaid taxes and approximately £700 to other creditors. He was at the time filming in Australia. (The Times, September 25th 1954).      Is interred with his last wife, Vera, at Westwood Memorial Park, Los Angeles, USA.      Some sources give his cause of death as a stroke.      Was paid 9,000 pounds sterling to appear in This Happy Breed (1944), the equivalent of $466,000 in 2012 dollars.      Alfred Hitchcock thought Louis Jourdan was all wrong as the lower class groom/lover in ""The Paradine Case,"" but he was overruled by producer David O. Selznick. Hitchcock wanted Newton for the part.      Newton\'s father was an artist and his mother a writer. The family had founded an art supply company, Winsor and Newton, in 1832 with J.M.W. Turner and Queen Vicyoria regular customers. Today the company is international in scope with 65% of its business is overseas.      Newton\'s only cinematic appearance in filmed Shakespeare was in Olivier\'s ""Henry V."".      At age 15 in 1920 Newton had his first brush with the theater at the Birmingham Reoertory Co. as a stagehand and scenery painter. Later that year he made his first onstage appearance in """"Henry IV, Part 1.      After being signed for the color remake of ""Svengali"" with a contract clause about his drinking, Newton behaved very irresponsibly on the film and fled to Australia, where he filmed the ""Long John Silver"" movie and TV shows. When he returned he was sued for $375,000 by the producers of ""Svengali,"" who had had to replace him with Donald Wolfit.

The males of the family had followed the military for several generations - his father and grandfather were commanders of the West Sussex regiment - but he decided on another road for his career. He was interested in acting and showed enough talent and potential to debut on stage at 16 and enter theater training for two years at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London the next year. Using his given middle name as a professional surname, in 1930 he moved up to a feature role with an all-star cast in the London revival of ""A Bill of Divorcement"". Other choice roles followed quickly: ""Kind Lady"" with Sybil Thorndike and the ""Last Enemy"" with Laurence Olivier. Even then Douglas was destined for a trans-Atlantic career. At the end of that same year of 1930 he came to Broadway to do the American version of ""Last Enemy"" with Jessica Tandy. Still he was back in London in 1931 to open yet another page in his acting career with the potential to be found in film work. With a rather rugged, squared-off good looks and purposeful acting voice, he found further work in the movies - comedies at first. But he had less than a dozen roles through 1939, for he was pursuing yet another interest - and that on the other side of the stage with producing and directing plays in the West End beginning in 1932 at age 23.The few film roles nevertheless kept ramping up in significance. By 1937 his first lead dramatic role in Our Fighting Navy (1937) tapped him for a real adventure. Bergfilms or mountain films, being a heroic if emotional epitomizing of Teutonic spirit against stark but beautiful nature, had been popular in Germany through the later silent era largely through the significant talents of German geologist-turned-director Arnold Fanck. His influenced on others included one of his leading men, a young Austrian World War I veteran officer of mountain troops named Luis Trenker. Trenker had already starred in two Fanck mountain films and was the first leading man (1926) of the controversial Leni Riefenstahl, Fanck\'s muse - of sorts. Fanck did the screenplay of a dramatic interpretation of the 1865 race between England, Switzerland, and Italy to first climb the Matterhorn in Switzerland for a 1928 film directed by Italian actor-director Mario Bonnard with Trenker as the historical Italian competitor \'Jean-Antoine Carrel\'. Trencker, a gifted sort of Renaissance man of many talents, turned to being director, writer, and producer as well in 1930. After several of his own Bergfilms and other efforts he decided to once again visit the Matterhorn subject in concert with British also actor-turned-director Milton Rosmer and then expatriate Hungarian writer Emeric Pressburger to do a British version of his German rendition of the drama which he called The Mountain Calls (1938). Trenker directed and co-starred as Carrel-once again-in his version, while he co-directed as alpine action supervisor and again played Carrel in the British version The Challenge (1938). Historically, the race was won by a little known young British mountaineer, \'Edward Whymper\', and Douglas with a striking theatrical resemblance to Whymper got the part. Due to Trenker\'s expertise as a mountaineer, the climbing sequences are very realistic and even the somewhat over dramatic dialog is stirring. Of the two films fortunately Douglas was perhaps the best remembered performer, although the German version on a whole was the more even, largely due to Trenker\'s considerable abilities as the go-to guy for just about anything needed to put a film in the can.For Douglas it was a busy 1939 with film work capped by his being one of the first British actors to enlist as World War II loomed. He became a Royal Navy pilot and would serve until 1946. He did one more British film and also produced, directed, and starred in ""Lighten Our Darkness"" on stage in London before heading over the Atlantic for good in 1947. He had been back to Broadway in 1931-32 and 1935 for two plays, the second, ""Most of the Game"", with his second wife, British actress Dorothy Hyson. And he had returned in 1942 for the musical ""The Time, the Place, and the Girl"". But now he had a Warner Bros. contract in hand and was on his way to a future in Hollywood. What followed was a few years of WB contract work that found Douglas the noble villain - and with his iron lipped scowl and a contrived harsh voice he could look any such part with a steady verve. He was first cast opposite a fast dissipating Errol Flynn, walking through the rather lackluster Adventures of Don Juan (1948). But he and Flynn got along fine and became friends and teamed again for Kim (1950), a much better film. A much more substantial role came to Douglas in the next year\'s The Fountainhead (1949), part of individualist Ayn Rand\'s corpus of heavy-handed hedonistic philosophy which amid the cast included vivacious-wholesome but downright sexy-newcomer Patricia Neal. With its dense and challenging dialog, Douglas considered it one of his favorite efforts. And there were other substantial amid many good efforts as Douglas moved into the 1950s and toward some freelance studio hopping. But certainly he was much in demand if not something of a fixture as the less than noble noble in such well known literary yarns as Ivanhoe (1952) and The Prisoner of Zenda (1952), and the concocted At Sword\'s Point (1952) all in one year.By the mid 1950s he was spending half his time exploring acting on the small screen and like his now more modest movie parts as a more senior character actor. But Douglas was not one to waste time. He was noticeably absent from acting in 1956 for the very reason that he had returned to Broadway - not as an actor but as a director (and producer for one) of four original comedy plays through that year. Though he had occasional roles into the late 1970s, Douglas launched into an unusually prolific life as a TV director starting in 1960. As such he supervised the shooting of nearly 40 episodic series - a full spectrum of popular shows from his start with ""Maverick"" and the list of heartthrob private eye series, to TV playhouse productions, many other westerns, law and order fare, and varied dramas. In many cases he returned to do multiple episodes, and in fact he became a directorial regular (16 episodes) on the World War II drama ""Twelve O\'Clock High"", during its sagging second and third seasons, no doubt his own air combat experience being a telling factor in his longevity. Douglas\'s one directorship on the big screen was for the British well regarded if economic spy thriller Night Train to Paris (1964).Still active as a TV director in 1982, Douglas thereafter retired but continued to appear on TV, providing historical perspective of the movie past, one in particular being his remembrances of an old friend in the 1983 documentary ""Errol Flynn: Portrait of a Swashbuckler"". At nearly 90 years old Robert Douglas passed away after as thoroughly an engaging film life as could ever be imagined.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       William McPeak          Spouse (2)               Suzanne Weldon          (23 August\xa01946            - 31 January\xa01995)\xa0(her death)\xa0(2 children)           Dorothy Hyson (21 May\xa01935            - 1945)\xa0(divorced)          Trivia (2)      His two children by his second wife Suzanne are son Robert Giles Finlayson of Encinitas, California, and daughter Lucinda Gail Gabri of Scotch Plains, New Jersey.

He first came to fame in May of 1940, when he led his armored division at the Battle of Sedan, where his troops broke through the French defenses and helped lead to the rout of the Allied troops in France. After France fell, Rommel was sent to Libya to assist the Italians when their ill-fated atack on the British in Egypt almost led to disaster. He formed the Afrika Korps (""Africa Corps"") and led the Axis troops to victory over the British in crucial battles like Tobruk. His dash and daring led to him being given the nickname ""The Desert Fox"" and his promotion to Field Marshall. Supply problems and personal illness led to defeat at El Alamein in 1942; afterwards, Rommel led the longest retreat in history, falling back all the way from Egypt through Libya and to Tunisia. In February of 1943, he broke through American defenses at Kasserine Pass, but was eventually defeated by combined American and British forces; Rommel was recalled to Germany by Hitler before the Afrika Korps surrendered in 1943. After North Africa, Rommel was sent to France in late 1943 to help prepare the French coastline from the expected Allied invasion. He was under the command of Field Marshall Gerd von Rundstedt; while the two disagreed on tactics (Rommel believed that the invading forces must be fought on the beaches while von Rundstedt believed that the Germans could fall back and entrap the attackers in the interior), both were united in their determination to defeat the Allies and a growing distaste for Adolph Hitler. Rommel was in Germany on June 6, 1944 (it was his wife\'s birthday) when word of the Normandy landings came. Rommel rushed back to France, but neither he nor von Rundstedt were unable to persuade Hitler to release the fifteen panzer divisons of the German Fifteenth Army from Calais to counterattack the Allies. (Hitler was convinced that the Normandy attack was a diversion and that the real assault would come at Pais de Calais.) Rommel was wounded when his staff car came under attack by Allied aircraft in July of 1994; days, later, a group of German officers and others almost assassinated Htiler by bomb at the Eastern Front headquarters on July 20, 1944. Hitler suspected Rommel of involvement in the plot and on October 14, 1944, sent two officers with an ultimatum - commit suicide and have your honor intact or stand trial and possibly have your family suffer. Rommel took the vial of poison and died that day; he was buried with full military honors.There is still some controversy whether Rommel was an active participant in the plot. Movies like The Desert Fox indicate he was a direct participant while others have his involvement more limited. Nevertheless, Rommel is remembered both for his honor and integrity as well as his drive and daring on the battlefield.""']","['Tom Bartlett', '""""']","['General', '""""']","[[<bound method Tag.get_text of <p>
Before Australia and New Zealand were threatened with attack on the
home front, they sent as they did in the First World War, an
expeditionary force to help Great Britain protect the Suez Canal, the
lifeline of the British Empire. Aussies and Kiwis made a great deal of
the army that General Wavell was commanding from Cairo. <br><br>They have always had a reputation as an informal people and it's with a
bit of surprise that spit and polish Scots officer Richard Burton is
put in charge of a batallion in a forward area of the defense perimeter
surrounding Tobruk. The men and Burton don't take to each other too
readily, but gradually the troops grow to respect Burton as a
courageous fighting man.<br><br>Burton as it happens gets a bit of assistance from an unexpected
quarter. His old schoolmaster Robert Newton had immigrated to Australia
and enlisted in their army at the start of World War II. When not
focusing on the battle sequences, The Desert Rats is about the
relationship between Burton and Newton. All the rules about army
discipline and separation of officers and enlisted men go by the boards
here. Burton who's been under a strain like everyone else under siege
at Tobruk gets a safety valve in Newton. An old friend from the past, a
father figure if you will, gives Burton someone he can confide his
innermost thoughts and fears to. <br><br>Sad to say the alcoholic Mr. Newton gives a refrained and dignified
performance as a middle aged alcoholic schoolmaster. A role he could
understand all too well from real life. He complements Burton's
performance every step of the way in this film. <br><br>Look for some good performances from Australian actors Charles Tingwell
and Chips Rafferty. Though this is a film about the Allied forces at
Tobruk in 1941 and no Americans were officially fighting, this is an
American production. So these two guys made their American cinema
debuts. Tingwell never made another American film, but Rafferty came
back a few times and his presence makes every film he's in just a bit
better.<br><br>You might recognize Michael Rennie's voice doing the offscreen

classic about the strain of command at every level of the Armed

Interesting re-enactment of the desert campaign during WWII as seen through
the experiences of one small company in the British army. They are a
disparate group of soldiers. A motley band of commonwealth troops of mixed
personalities led by  Captain MacRoberts played by Richard Burton. Through
the fire and hell of battling the Desert Fox and his war-hardened troops
MacRoberts by lifting their spirits and their morale eventually melds his
men into a fighting fit group of warriors. Enough said.<br><br>Although the story has neither the forced authenticity of 'The Longest Day'
or the Hollywood panache of 'Where Eagles Dare' I believe it still manages
to stand out in a special place on its own. Prior to a host of many other
war movies it was the first to concentrate exclusively on the common soldier
in the trenches, his anxieties for the present and hopes for the future. I
also liked the side story of the young captain who is surprised to have
under his command a favourite old school master, Bartlett played by Robert
Newton. It causes some quizzical looks amongst the men, especially when he
insists on continuing to address the old private as sir. Here the Desert Fox
is played with dignity and respect by James Mason. The other german
characters are also portrayed benignly, perhaps in view of the fact that
very few atrocities were committed by Rommel's troops unlike their
counterparts in Eastern Europe. History records accurately what eventually
happened to Rommel in the aftermath of the plot to assassinate Hitler but
here that is all in the near future. I recommend this b &amp; w film to all war
movie buffs of this English made genre but if you're looking for 'Saving
Private Ryan' perhaps you should give it a miss.

1941 Lybian desert, North Africa. German forces are pushing through to
Suez, the key to the Middle East , only Tobruk is still holding out,
there's a considerable unit there. With the British in full retreat,
nothing stood in Rommel's way but the tiny garrison of Empire troops
cut off in the fortress won of Tobruk.Meantime, Germans dropping
leaflets captioning : Surrender! German forces have surrounded Tobruk,
it is useless to try to escape. Single soldiers waving handkerchiefs
will not be fired upon. Aussies..do not sacrifice yourselves
needlessly. Lay down your arms. Surrender! . The picture is the story
of Tobruk and the men who made up its garrison, of the fight they made
against the pick of Hitler's troops and of the nickname they won with
blood and bore with pride: ¨The Deser Rats¨. British headquarter
Cairo's ordered to take up defensive positions for two months ,reunited
the officers(Robert Douglas, Torin Thatcher, among others) deal the
Tobruk 's defense : the positions are the following, the first line of
defense ,using the old Italian perimeter, the second line by Colonel
White's supporting artillery and the inner fortification. The British
plan of defense is based chiefly on the belief of a Bilzkrieg by
Rommel(a splendid James Mason reprise his role from ¨The Desert fox¨).
The general proposes to let Rommel's tanks come through here unopposed,
leaving the tanks to proceed up this avenue alone. Colonel White will
have moved artillery to line both sides of the avenue.Meanwhile the
soldiers are already digging positions for the captured Italian
field-pieces. So, the longer we hold our fire, the deeper Rommel's
tanks will advance into this box and the easier they will be to
destroy. The General assigns to McRoberts, an infantry captain with
battle experience, twice decorated, he must put into the line.The
crusty captain( a stiff but sensitive acting by Richard Burton) takes a
charge of an Australian division formed by valiant soldiers and a
kind-hearted schoolmaster alcoholic(sensible performance by Robert
Newton steal the show as drunk turned reluctant soldier) fighting a
desperate rearguard action against overwhelming German forces.<br><br>This reconstruction of a phase in the battle of Tobruk(deeds also
filmed by Arthur Hiller in ¨Tobruk¨ with Rock Hudson) is correctly
based on true events, though excessive importance for the Aussies. The
actual deeds are based on series of engagements between British and
Axis forces over Libyan port. Occupied by Italy 1911, Tobruk was taken
by Britain in Operation Battleaxe 1941.It was captured by Field Marshal
Erwin Rommel June 1942 after the retreat of the main British force to
Egypt, and this precipitated General Sir Claude Auchinleck's
replacement by General Bernard Montgomery as British commander.
Montgomery recovered it after the second of Battle of El Alamein and it
remained in British hands for the rest of the war.

In 1941, during the World War II, Field Marshal Erwin von Rommel (James
Mason) tries to conquer the city of Tobruk in Libya and the British
battalion defends this location to avoid Rommel to reach the Suez
Canal. The young, but experienced British Capt. 'Tammy' MacRoberts
(Richard Burton) leads a limited number of inexperienced Australian
troops in the defense of Tobruk, and uses raids during the night
against Rommel forces to keep the balance between the strong German
army and the reduced British-Australian forces, and MacRoberts' troops
are called ""The Desert Rats"". ""The Desert Rats"" is a very realistic war
movie, presenting strategies, battles, action scenes and a great duel
between James Mason and Richard Burton. I am not sure whether Robert
Wise used footage of some real battle scenes along the film, since the
realism in the black and white photography is amazing and sometimes it
looks like a documentary. There are also excellent lines between
Richard Burton and James Mason, and Richard Burton and Robert Newton,
in the role of the former teacher of MacRoberts. ""The Desert Rats"" is a
highly recommended movie. My vote is eight.<br><br>Title (Brazil): ""Ratos do Deserto"" (""Desert Rats"")

This was the first movies I was ever allowed to stay up and watch on
the old Saturday Night At The Movies show on NBC so it has always had a
fond place in my heart. Although some might dismiss it as clichéd, it
is a tight, well told story that some of today's films might do well to
emulate. The realism, ambivalence, and irony of today's war films is
definitely missing but one should remember that this was the ""good""
war. While the other reviewers may criticize its historical accuracy,
as someone who grew up hearing war stories from American and Canadian
WWI and WWII veterans, it does capture the feeling of a period without
going overboard on heroics or far-fetched plot twists.

I haven't seen this gem in almost 20 years and AMC presented it today.
An excellent look at the British war effort against the Germans and
Italians in North Africa. Except for the minor mistakes of weaponry
(American made Thompsons in the hands of Germans, Colt M1917
water-cooled MGs for German MGs, etc) this was a realistic and rousing
tale of the North African campaign. Of course Hollywood liberties were
taken, it is a movie, not a documentary. The interplay between Richard
Burton and Robert Newton was excellent, with Newton's performance the
proper balance for Burton's sometimes hysterical scene-chewing. That is
is based loosely on real events and in many cases ANZAC and British
troops did hold back Rommel's attacks many times only enhances the
story. Kudos to the makers and an excellent addition to any war movie
collection.

This is a really enjoyable movie. Burton and Newton do a fine job, as
do a cast of familiar British character actors. James Mason in his
first outing as Rommel is especially fun. He reprised the role in a
later Rommel bio-pic (titled ""The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel"").<br><br>Despite it's age, most of the attempts at special effects (artillery in
the distance, explosions done via matte) come off well. As for the
scenes where they really shoot off some pyrotechnics, they spared no
expense! The overall portrait of the desert and army life looks very
real and has the ring of truth. The plot is exciting and never drags.<br><br>The only problems are the over-patriotic script (I guess we should cut
them some slack here, this movie was made much closer to the war than
we are today!) and as noted elsewhere, the inappropriate German
weapons. It's amazing that they used Thompson machine guns instead of
MP40's, when for the next 30 years everybody from ""The Man from
U.N.C.L.E."" to James Bond would use the MP40 all over the place. In
summary I think this movie was a bit better than I expected and holds
up well to repeated viewings.

The Desert Rats is a very enjoyable WWII film dealing with a portion of
the war that may seem alien to those in America. Americans are accused,
and sometimes rightly so, of thinking WWII began and ended with
America's involvement. But it didn't. The Desert Rats is the story of
the Allies last stand in Northern Africa at Tobruk. Rommel and the
Nazis would have clear sailing to the important Suez if Tobruk fell.
It's up to Capt. MacRoberts (Richard Burton) and his band of green
Aussie replacements to stop the advance of Hitler's army.<br><br>When you read comments about war movies, you always read complaints
about historical accuracy. Is The Desert Rats true to history? I'm not
a student of history, so I wouldn't know. Furthermore, I don't really
care. To me, it's about the entertainment I get from a film and I've
always found The Desert Rats entertaining. The authentic looking sets,
the tremendous ground shaking explosions, the plot that focuses on a
small band of men, and the action sequences are all highlights of the
movie for me. Robert Wise's direction and Lucien Ballard's
cinematography put the viewer in the middle of the action. You can all
but feel the rocks pounding down as each Nazi shell hits. It's very
well done.<br><br>My only complaint about The Desert Rats is in the overall construction.
I realize that it's a result of attempting to be historically accurate,

The film opens with its best moments. The battle scene between the
dug-in Aussie's and Rommel's tanks is as exciting and well filmed as
I've seen in a war movie. Unfortunately, the movie (as dictated by
history) cannot keep up this pace. The ending, as the now
battle-hardened Aussie hold a hill waiting for replacements, is

clearly.  He is the kind, timorous, brilliant failure who, in one burst of

Before Australia and New Zealand were threatened with attack on the
home front, they sent as they did in the First World War, an
expeditionary force to help Great Britain protect the Suez Canal, the
lifeline of the British Empire. Aussies and Kiwis made a great deal of
the army that General Wavell was commanding from Cairo. <br><br>They have always had a reputation as an informal people and it's with a
bit of surprise that spit and polish Scots officer Richard Burton is
put in charge of a batallion in a forward area of the defense perimeter
surrounding Tobruk. The men and Burton don't take to each other too
readily, but gradually the troops grow to respect Burton as a
courageous fighting man.<br><br>Burton as it happens gets a bit of assistance from an unexpected
quarter. His old schoolmaster Robert Newton had immigrated to Australia
and enlisted in their army at the start of World War II. When not
focusing on the battle sequences, The Desert Rats is about the
relationship between Burton and Newton. All the rules about army
discipline and separation of officers and enlisted men go by the boards
here. Burton who's been under a strain like everyone else under siege
at Tobruk gets a safety valve in Newton. An old friend from the past, a
father figure if you will, gives Burton someone he can confide his
innermost thoughts and fears to. <br><br>Sad to say the alcoholic Mr. Newton gives a refrained and dignified
performance as a middle aged alcoholic schoolmaster. A role he could
understand all too well from real life. He complements Burton's
performance every step of the way in this film. <br><br>Look for some good performances from Australian actors Charles Tingwell
and Chips Rafferty. Though this is a film about the Allied forces at
Tobruk in 1941 and no Americans were officially fighting, this is an
American production. So these two guys made their American cinema
debuts. Tingwell never made another American film, but Rafferty came
back a few times and his presence makes every film he's in just a bit
better.<br><br>You might recognize Michael Rennie's voice doing the offscreen
narration for The Desert Rats. The Desert Rats is a timeless wartime
classic about the strain of command at every level of the Armed
Services.

Interesting re-enactment of the desert campaign during WWII as seen through
the experiences of one small company in the British army. They are a
disparate group of soldiers. A motley band of commonwealth troops of mixed
personalities led by  Captain MacRoberts played by Richard Burton. Through
the fire and hell of battling the Desert Fox and his war-hardened troops
MacRoberts by lifting their spirits and their morale eventually melds his
men into a fighting fit group of warriors. Enough said.<br><br>Although the story has neither the forced authenticity of 'The Longest Day'
or the Hollywood panache of 'Where Eagles Dare' I believe it still manages
to stand out in a special place on its own. Prior to a host of many other
war movies it was the first to concentrate exclusively on the common soldier
in the trenches, his anxieties for the present and hopes for the future. I
also liked the side story of the young captain who is surprised to have
under his command a favourite old school master, Bartlett played by Robert
Newton. It causes some quizzical looks amongst the men, especially when he
insists on continuing to address the old private as sir. Here the Desert Fox
is played with dignity and respect by James Mason. The other german
characters are also portrayed benignly, perhaps in view of the fact that
very few atrocities were committed by Rommel's troops unlike their
counterparts in Eastern Europe. History records accurately what eventually
happened to Rommel in the aftermath of the plot to assassinate Hitler but
here that is all in the near future. I recommend this b &amp; w film to all war
movie buffs of this English made genre but if you're looking for 'Saving
Private Ryan' perhaps you should give it a miss.

1941 Lybian desert, North Africa. German forces are pushing through to
Suez, the key to the Middle East , only Tobruk is still holding out,
there's a considerable unit there. With the British in full retreat,
nothing stood in Rommel's way but the tiny garrison of Empire troops
cut off in the fortress won of Tobruk.Meantime, Germans dropping
leaflets captioning : Surrender! German forces have surrounded Tobruk,
it is useless to try to escape. Single soldiers waving handkerchiefs
will not be fired upon. Aussies..do not sacrifice yourselves
needlessly. Lay down your arms. Surrender! . The picture is the story
of Tobruk and the men who made up its garrison, of the fight they made
against the pick of Hitler's troops and of the nickname they won with
blood and bore with pride: ¨The Deser Rats¨. British headquarter
Cairo's ordered to take up defensive positions for two months ,reunited
the officers(Robert Douglas, Torin Thatcher, among others) deal the
Tobruk 's defense : the positions are the following, the first line of
defense ,using the old Italian perimeter, the second line by Colonel
White's supporting artillery and the inner fortification. The British
plan of defense is based chiefly on the belief of a Bilzkrieg by
Rommel(a splendid James Mason reprise his role from ¨The Desert fox¨).
The general proposes to let Rommel's tanks come through here unopposed,
leaving the tanks to proceed up this avenue alone. Colonel White will
have moved artillery to line both sides of the avenue.Meanwhile the
soldiers are already digging positions for the captured Italian
field-pieces. So, the longer we hold our fire, the deeper Rommel's
tanks will advance into this box and the easier they will be to
destroy. The General assigns to McRoberts, an infantry captain with
battle experience, twice decorated, he must put into the line.The
crusty captain( a stiff but sensitive acting by Richard Burton) takes a
charge of an Australian division formed by valiant soldiers and a
kind-hearted schoolmaster alcoholic(sensible performance by Robert
Newton steal the show as drunk turned reluctant soldier) fighting a
desperate rearguard action against overwhelming German forces.<br><br>This reconstruction of a phase in the battle of Tobruk(deeds also
filmed by Arthur Hiller in ¨Tobruk¨ with Rock Hudson) is correctly
based on true events, though excessive importance for the Aussies. The
actual deeds are based on series of engagements between British and
Axis forces over Libyan port. Occupied by Italy 1911, Tobruk was taken
by Britain in Operation Battleaxe 1941.It was captured by Field Marshal
Erwin Rommel June 1942 after the retreat of the main British force to
Egypt, and this precipitated General Sir Claude Auchinleck's
replacement by General Bernard Montgomery as British commander.
Montgomery recovered it after the second of Battle of El Alamein and it
remained in British hands for the rest of the war.

In 1941, during the World War II, Field Marshal Erwin von Rommel (James
Mason) tries to conquer the city of Tobruk in Libya and the British
battalion defends this location to avoid Rommel to reach the Suez
Canal. The young, but experienced British Capt. 'Tammy' MacRoberts
(Richard Burton) leads a limited number of inexperienced Australian
troops in the defense of Tobruk, and uses raids during the night
against Rommel forces to keep the balance between the strong German
army and the reduced British-Australian forces, and MacRoberts' troops
are called ""The Desert Rats"". ""The Desert Rats"" is a very realistic war
movie, presenting strategies, battles, action scenes and a great duel
between James Mason and Richard Burton. I am not sure whether Robert
Wise used footage of some real battle scenes along the film, since the
realism in the black and white photography is amazing and sometimes it
looks like a documentary. There are also excellent lines between
Richard Burton and James Mason, and Richard Burton and Robert Newton,
in the role of the former teacher of MacRoberts. ""The Desert Rats"" is a
highly recommended movie. My vote is eight.<br><br>Title (Brazil): ""Ratos do Deserto"" (""Desert Rats"")

This was the first movies I was ever allowed to stay up and watch on
the old Saturday Night At The Movies show on NBC so it has always had a
fond place in my heart. Although some might dismiss it as clichéd, it
is a tight, well told story that some of today's films might do well to
emulate. The realism, ambivalence, and irony of today's war films is
definitely missing but one should remember that this was the ""good""
war. While the other reviewers may criticize its historical accuracy,
as someone who grew up hearing war stories from American and Canadian
WWI and WWII veterans, it does capture the feeling of a period without
going overboard on heroics or far-fetched plot twists.

I haven't seen this gem in almost 20 years and AMC presented it today.
An excellent look at the British war effort against the Germans and
Italians in North Africa. Except for the minor mistakes of weaponry
(American made Thompsons in the hands of Germans, Colt M1917
water-cooled MGs for German MGs, etc) this was a realistic and rousing
tale of the North African campaign. Of course Hollywood liberties were
taken, it is a movie, not a documentary. The interplay between Richard
Burton and Robert Newton was excellent, with Newton's performance the
proper balance for Burton's sometimes hysterical scene-chewing. That is
is based loosely on real events and in many cases ANZAC and British
troops did hold back Rommel's attacks many times only enhances the
story. Kudos to the makers and an excellent addition to any war movie
collection.

This is a really enjoyable movie. Burton and Newton do a fine job, as
do a cast of familiar British character actors. James Mason in his
first outing as Rommel is especially fun. He reprised the role in a
later Rommel bio-pic (titled ""The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel"").<br><br>Despite it's age, most of the attempts at special effects (artillery in
the distance, explosions done via matte) come off well. As for the
scenes where they really shoot off some pyrotechnics, they spared no
expense! The overall portrait of the desert and army life looks very
real and has the ring of truth. The plot is exciting and never drags.<br><br>The only problems are the over-patriotic script (I guess we should cut
them some slack here, this movie was made much closer to the war than
we are today!) and as noted elsewhere, the inappropriate German
weapons. It's amazing that they used Thompson machine guns instead of
MP40's, when for the next 30 years everybody from ""The Man from
U.N.C.L.E."" to James Bond would use the MP40 all over the place. In
summary I think this movie was a bit better than I expected and holds
up well to repeated viewings.

The Desert Rats is a very enjoyable WWII film dealing with a portion of
the war that may seem alien to those in America. Americans are accused,
and sometimes rightly so, of thinking WWII began and ended with
America's involvement. But it didn't. The Desert Rats is the story of
the Allies last stand in Northern Africa at Tobruk. Rommel and the
Nazis would have clear sailing to the important Suez if Tobruk fell.
It's up to Capt. MacRoberts (Richard Burton) and his band of green
Aussie replacements to stop the advance of Hitler's army.<br><br>When you read comments about war movies, you always read complaints
about historical accuracy. Is The Desert Rats true to history? I'm not
a student of history, so I wouldn't know. Furthermore, I don't really
care. To me, it's about the entertainment I get from a film and I've
always found The Desert Rats entertaining. The authentic looking sets,
the tremendous ground shaking explosions, the plot that focuses on a
small band of men, and the action sequences are all highlights of the
movie for me. Robert Wise's direction and Lucien Ballard's
cinematography put the viewer in the middle of the action. You can all
but feel the rocks pounding down as each Nazi shell hits. It's very
well done.<br><br>My only complaint about The Desert Rats is in the overall construction.
I realize that it's a result of attempting to be historically accurate,
but history doesn't always put events in the most exciting sequences.
The film opens with its best moments. The battle scene between the
dug-in Aussie's and Rommel's tanks is as exciting and well filmed as
I've seen in a war movie. Unfortunately, the movie (as dictated by
history) cannot keep up this pace. The ending, as the now
battle-hardened Aussie hold a hill waiting for replacements, is
anticlimactic.

Christmas, family, and infidelity. Yvette's husband has died, and her grown daughters join her at the grave: Sonia, wealthy, bourgeois, and generous; Louba, living with their dad Stanislas, singing at a Russian restaurant, penniless, the mistress for the past 12 years of a man who will never leave his wife; Milla, the youngest, acerbic, lonesome. Christmas was when they learned their parents were divorcing 25 years ago. Over the next few days, yuletide depression, Louba's pregnancy, Sonia's crumbling marriage, Stanislas's overtures to Yvette, and Milla's attraction to the man who's her father's rent-free lodger lead each one to re-examine self, family, and hopes. Is renewal possible?                Written by

She lived with her mother, brothers, and sister on a farm not far from Saint-Tropez in Provence (southern France), because her father, singer and poet Guy Béart, did not want his children to be affected by the glamour world of Paris. When Emmanuelle was thirteen, she saw Romy Schneider in the movie Mado (1976). From that time on, she wanted to be an actress. In Emmanuelle\'s teens, her parents sent her to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, for four years, so she could learn English. There, she was engaged for a Robert Altman movie that was never made. After returning to France, she took drama classes and got her first TV role, in Raison perdue (1984). David Hamilton, the photographer/director, was impressed by her beauty and gave her a role in Premiers désirs (1983). She met her spouse-to-be, Daniel Auteuil, while making L\'amour en douce (1985). The film that made her famous in France was Manon des sources (1986), in which she played the role of a blonde shepherd dancing nude in the fields. Director Tom McLoughlin chose her out of 5,000 candidates for her first Hollywood picture, Date with an Angel (1987). Emmanuelle is a very sensitive and a perfectionist. For the part of Camille in the film Un coeur en hiver (1992), she took violin lessons for a whole year. Her biggest success was as a nude model in the art film La belle noiseuse (1991), which starred Michel Piccoli and was directed by Jacques Rivette.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Wladimir van Heemst < clar@kabelfoon.nl>          Spouse (2) Michaël Cohen (13 August\xa02008            - 2011)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)           Daniel Auteuil (10 September\xa01993            - 21 September\xa01995)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)          Trivia (24)      Chosen by Empire magazine as one of the 100 Sexiest Stars in film history (#32).

We\'ve all had that fear, that despair of losing someone, or this fierce desire because it\'s not reciprocated. The less reciprocation there is, the more desire we have.      I am a voyager - and the voyage cannot mean that I stay at home.      Beauty is not something you can count on. Usually, when people say you are beautiful, it is when there is a harmony between the inside and the outside.      I stay in France. Better to be the queen of a village than a servant in a kingdom.      There is a phrase in French, which means \'to miss.\' To pass by. To not be able to stop. You love someone and someone loves you, but it just can\'t work for different reasons.      For me, I don\'t feel it is a success in the career to be the pretty woman; career success comes from being characters who tell us something about the truth.      I have no TV, thank God. I haven\'t heard anything about Tom Cruise, except that he had a baby, I think.      I\'m trying my best to keep my private life guarded. It\'s not easy at all. Non, non, non.      My parents sent me to Montreal because I kept getting kicked out of school in France.      I was a very bad student. I didn\'t know what I wanted to do, but I knew I didn\'t want to go farther in school. I hated school and was always the bad one; I was always insulting the teachers.      My looks haven\'t prevented me from playing prostitutes or people broken by life. But when they need a token blonde with big breasts, that\'s OK, too. It\'s part of the game.      Often, when you see yourself on the screen, you feel like a sweater that\'s been put through the washing machine. You have the impression of having done something full and luminous, and suddenly, when you see it on the screen, it\'s turned back into a tiny little thing.      If I have one thing perfect, it\'s my eyebrows. And my feet. I love my feet. They\'re like Japanese feet. The rest I would like to hide. Especially my freckles. I feel ridiculous.      In Hollywood there\'s no real material. They would send me stuff, but I hadn\'t even seen the director. If I don\'t see the director\'s eyes, I\'m not going. I\'m not even going to pack my bags.      I am an actress, I earn money, I am well-known. I don\'t think it is altruism to become engaged in humanitarian work. It\'s the least one can do.      When you are happy and in love and when you have children, then maybe you are beautiful.      I played football when I was little. I didn\'t want to be an actress at all, I wanted to be a majorette in an Australian circus. That was my ambition.      You may think of me as an object of desire and I\'m going to tell you that I can be in front of you naked and not be erotic.      There are a lot of films where I play characters that are about the windows to the interior person rather than the exterior.      Sometimes you feel more naked when you\'re totally dressed than the other way around.      I keep reading that I\'m cold. But I\'m not, I\'m shy. And I play a lot of women of fire and sexuality like an animal - so I\'m cold on one side and fiery on the other.      The body is an actor\'s tool, like the face, malleable. I never thought that being naked was immoral or outrageous.      I think my best work has been in France with great men. It\'s been my great fortune to work with really great men - with Olivier Assayas, Raoul Ruiz, Jacques Rivette. I am tutored by them.      Today I would say, \'I am against plastic surgery.\' It\'s a grave act. An act that touches our soul. It was frightening.      When I\'m playing a part, I can feel all my body playing it; it\'s like really making love.      Once I opened my eyes to the realities of life, I couldn\'t close them.      The press follow me. I sue them. That\'s the deal.      If a man or woman has something redone it is because he or she can no longer live with that part of their body, it is no longer bearable. Either they get help and find the strength to fight or they proceed with the act.      The body, in \'La Belle Noiseuse,\' was the source of the artist\'s creativity.      It is not easy to age in harmony with one\'s roles.      My looks mean nothing to me. If anything, they are a hindrance.      It is not easy to grow old in this business, when you are a woman above all, in the cinema.      My body is an instrument for me to use.      I wouldn\'t say I was a rebel as such, but I certainly wasn\'t right at school.      I have never had so much fun as in Montreal. I taught the kids French, I baby-sat, I went to school, I was a receptionist at a hairdresser\'s, I danced and drank all night. I found that the more you do, the more you have time to do... it\'s weird, non?      I don\'t see my old films, but I think of the characters I played as friends, like the women I meet in my life who made strong impressions on me. I remember them and they are part of me.      I just decided that I would not put my professional life on hold to raise children. I know that sounds selfish to a lot of people and I don\'t know if what I\'m doing is the right thing. But that\'s the way I\'m doing it.      I\'ve just done a film in the United States. It\'s a thriller called \'A Crime\', with Harvey Keitel, we play against each other, and it\'s so great to play in another language. But I\'m definitely not American.      Of course I am political. You \'ave to be don\'t you? Every day it is about your future, your right to that future. \'Ow can people ignore this? We \'ave to leave a good world for our children, n\'est-ce pas?      I dream about singing. I would love to sing and write.      I give everything I have to give on the screen. I feel I don\'t owe the public anything else.      I started acting without any vocation. I continued out of love.      I had my mouth done when I was 27. It was a botched job. Obviously, if I had liked my mouth I wouldn\'t have had it re-done.      I feel better in my body now than when I was 20. Why not?      I don\'t give a damn about Hollywood.      After 10 years of French torture - psychological torture - it\'s great to do an American movie.      I can\'t just react on the strength of an email and three pages of synopsis, and say I\'m going to take off for three months of my life.      I\'m less desperate now to express what\'s inside me, that\'s true - I act these days because it keeps me awake and interested, an eternal student.      I don\'t always see my movies right away. And there are some I haven\'t seen at all. Sometimes that bothers the directors, so I\'m obliged to see them.      Very often with an American movie, the end is very happy and you just feel good when you go out. When you go to a French movie, it\'s kind of like, oh!, and you can\'t go out; you\'re stuck in your chair. It goes so deeply inside of the heart.      We were raised without movies, theater or music. We had only nature, the hills, the trees. When I got on the set of \'Manon,\' I wasn\'t star-struck because I didn\'t know what a star was.Salary (1)8 femmes\xa0(2002)       398,698 Euros          if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nCharlotte Gainsbourg ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 65 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(27)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(29)\xa0|Salary\xa0(4)  Overview (3)Date of Birth21\xa0July1971,\xa0London, England, UK Birth NameCharlotte Lucy GainsbourgHeight5\'\xa08""\xa0(1.73\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Charlotte Gainsbourg was born in London, England in 1971.

Girls can wear jeans, cut their hair short, wear shirts and boots, \'cause it\'s okay to be a boy, but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading.      At the beginning it wasn\'t to do with the work, it was more the experience.      Everyone gets the feeling that they know you and they know your life, and I felt really embarrassed by that.      I still find it hard to push my own limits. I know where my limits are and that I always have to push myself.      I hope I\'ll consider my next part, having learnt from this one.      Wanting to do it was much more powerful than the fright.      You think that being a girl is degrading, but secretly, you\'d love to know what it\'s like, wouldn\'t you?      Letting go of things and not being afraid of being ridiculous or over the top - I think that\'s the main thing for me to work on.      I found it very difficult to explain to someone why you did a film. It\'s not like having a conversation.      It\'s more than a job. It\'s very personal, so when you\'re hurt, you\'re really hurt inside.      I used to hate being recognised.      I was putting all those pressures on myself.      I couldn\'t do anything else, I enjoy it so much. But I find it tough.      I hated seeing myself on screen. I was full of complexes. I hated my face for a very, very long time.      When you love someone, you don\'t want them to suffer at all.      I wasn\'t getting the responses I hoped for. You can\'t protect yourself from other judgments.      I went on television and I wouldn\'t say a word; I feel so stupid when I watch them again.      I\'m desperate to work again. I\'ve often had those periods, but two years was the longest.      I\'m a very shy person towards my intimacy and private life.      In France, you\'re with the crew, and you have lunch with them. It\'s more like a family.      The character is close to me, except that I haven\'t lived through those situations, so it\'s not completely me.      It\'s nice that we have all these different films.      The English was really my mother, it was never me. Being the daughter of my father, I always felt very French.      The more you turn down things, the more difficult it becomes to feel that the next one will be right.      The more sincere I could be, the better it would be for the film.      There were always questions about my parents; I got so fed up with that.      You don\'t even need the director\'s judgement. It\'s too much.      I thought people would ask me really personal questions because I\'ve shown more of myself, but it\'s a comedy, and people understand that it\'s a game we play.Salary (4)L\'un reste, l\'autre part\xa0(2005)      €325,000       Lemming\xa0(2005)      €325,000       Prête-moi ta main\xa0(2006)      €450,000       Antichrist\xa0(2009)      €75,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nClaude Rich ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 6 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(2)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(2)  Overview (2)Date of Birth8\xa0February1929,\xa0Strasbourg, Bas-Rhin, France Height5\'\xa010½""\xa0(1.79\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Claude Rich was born on February 8, 1929 in Strasbourg, Bas-Rhin, France.

I was just reading other comments made about this movie, and
they were so negative that made me want to try and say a couple of
words to say that the movie is great, entertaining, interesting,
funny, original. A perfect plot, mastered with capacity and played at
perfection. If you want to see a movie that shows how the magic of
life beats the magic of christmas, go to see the movie, and be
ready to face entangled plots of lives humoristically
interwined.

Every year, American TV serves up so-called holiday fare, meaning
made-for-TV
movies about Brady Bunch-like families getting together for Christmas.
Most
are so forgettable that they get thrown out faster than used Christmas
wrapping.<br><br>The French are in general much better at dealing on film with human
relationships and the complexities of modern families and so I guess it
should come as no surprise that they put together a far more engrossing
story of a Christmas gathering.<br><br>Daniele Thompson's ""La Buche"" delves into the complex relationships in one
family which is just days away form Christmas when the stepfather dies.
The
film opens humorously at his funeral, which for some is a time of mourning
and for others,just a great, big inconvenience.<br><br>There are three intriguing daughters in this family and all of them lead
complex lives, propelled along by the same thing that propels most French
films -- love.  The oldest daughter, played by Sabine Azema, is a 42-year
old singer in a Russian cabaret who has been having an affair for 12 years
with a married man.  The middle sister, Emmanuelle Beart, is the woman who
appears to have everything: beauty, wealth, husband, kids and the kind of
controlling personality that keeps them all dancing to her tune. The
youngest sister, Charlotte Gainsberg, is a vaguely rebellious young,
motorcycle riding loner who has no man of her own, but would like one.
Then
there's their real father, Claude Riche, a guy who apparently during his
active years bedded more women than Magic Johnson.<br><br>American holiday movies usually include some family members in crisis and
a
lot of family members sharing recriminations about past transgressions.
""La
Buche"" serves up its share of both, but with a French twist. Everyone in
this family has their share of sins to confess and forgiveness to seek and
in some cases, even monumental decisions to face.  But they all seem to do
it not only with style and grace, but with a lot of humor thrown in for
good
measure. If this holiday film has a message, it seems to be that you can
make the best of any situation if you try hard enough.<br><br>The acting and directing here are first rate and the characters,
especially
the three daughters, are so intriguing you almost don't want the film to
end.  You want to find out how all three daughters handle the changes
coming
to their lives.<br><br>That's probably the best thing you can say about any film and hats off to
director Thompson for making it so with ""La Buche.""<br><br>

Danielle Thompson has written a lot for the cinema. Some of her best
efforts have been ""La Reine Margot"", ""Le cerveau"", and ""Cousin,
cousine"", among others. Ms. Thompson, whose first directorial job this
is, wanted, perhaps, to give her public a good dramatic comedy when she
undertook this project. The results are somewhat pleasing.<br><br>The story centers about three sisters that are as different from one
another as they are from their mother. Louba, Sonia and Milla have gone
to have their own lives, but when they are reunited on December 20th,
just before Christmas, they show they care for one another in more ways
than we realize.<br><br>Sabina Azema, Emmanuelle Beart and Charlotte Gainsbourg play the three
siblings with style. The lovely Francoise Fabian is seen as their
mother. Also in the cast, Claude Rich and the director's son,
Christopher Thompson.<br><br>Ms. Thompson gives us a different take on Christmas, something we don't
often see on the screen.

My favorite holiday movie for modern times!, February 1, 2005 <br><br>Reviewer:   Glutton for books - See all my reviews <br><br>The first time I watched ""La Buche,"" was a few days before Christmas in
2000, when I was not able to visit the family for Christmas. I saw it
with a French friend who was not able to go home either. It is an
absolutely delightful French movie about the pressures associated with
the holiday season, with thought -provoking characters. Much of it will
make you laugh, but I hesitate to define it as a comedy, because the
term implies a simplicity which the film exceeds by including many
dramatic aspects of life; chief of these are questions of identity,
what makes us happy in life, and who are family and what are they for. <br><br>The core of the plot is members of a family spending the Christmas
together, who have not shared a Christams celebration in many years. La
Buche refers to a type of Christmas cake often eaten in France during
Christmas. For the uninitiated, the French please excuse my
description, it resembles a large Liitle Debbie Swiss roll. The
characters of the film, like family life, are full of unexpected
surprises. <br><br>Yvette, mother of the family is grieving from the loss of her second
husband, and the film opens at a funeral. Her deceased husband was a
musician, as was her first husband. The person may have died but it
seems that the jealousy lives on. The father of the family, Stanislas,
is the mother's first husband. He usually spends the Christmas alone
with his favorite daughter, Milla, believing that it should not be an
stressful time for him because he is Jewish, trying unsuccessfully each
year to avoid the pressure associated with the holiday and its memories
of its painful past, such as when he left his life in Russia behind as
an child immigrant with no possessions. This year he takes a different
approach to Christmas, due to a near death experience, the recent
widowhood of Yvette, and determination to make amends for mistakes from
his past. <br><br>Neither parent was a perfect spouse, but the children (who are grown
adults) have varying perceptions of who is the better person. There are
three daughters: Milla views her mother with contempt, Sonia faults the
father, and Louba seems equally devoted to both. <br><br>Sonia and Milla seem the epitome of success; one with an apparently
ideal marriage and family, one with a thriving career. The other
daughter, Louba, appears to be the least ambitious and successful in
life. But what really constitutes ideas like ambition, success, and
happiness? How should these values to be qualified? What guarantees do
we have for stability in life in our pursuit or implementation of such
qualities? Apparently, one of Stanislas' most cherished Christmas
memories was when as a poor child he received one simple toy, and the
gift of a safe place to spend the night. <br><br>In addition to the traditional family, there is Joseph a boarder to
whom Stanislas rents his former music studio, and who has a young child
from a previous marriage and desperately wants to spend Christmas with
her. Joseph rushes Stanislas to the hospital and saves his life; a
service which makes the daughters curious to learn more about him and
his life. <br><br>To delve too much into explaining the characters of the film, gives
away much of the film's surprises that make it so enjoyable. In true
form to good characterization, no one is exactly whom they first appear
to be, and learning who they really are is the best part of the viewing
experience. <br><br>There is much stress during the holiday season to pretend that life is
working out according to plans and that you are happy, because it is a
time for celebration. Even those who are not formally religious
experience this pressure during the holiday season. <br><br>This movie examines that phenomena and makes you feel that you are not
an anomaly for feeling tension associated with encountering family
during that time of the year. By the end of the film, you feel it is
okay to admit the problems that pretension of perfection exerts on your
life, even if it is Christmas. In fact, the film teaches that the
ability to share your imperfections and sorrows, as well as your hidden
aspirations is part of what constitutes a family, and exercising this
ability cements your familial relations for the better. Despite the
gravity of the characters' problems and conflicts, this is ultimately a
great feel-good film, that can be enjoyed at any time of the year.

Three sisters, the Parisians with the sweet Russian names, Sonya, Lyuba
and Milla and their parents who have been divorced for 25 years but
still have a lot to say to each other are in the center of this
charming, clever, funny, touching and poignant dramedy that takes place
one year in Paris from December 20 till Christmas Eve. It will start
with the funeral and it will end with the Christmas party in which all
members of this dysfunctional family participate but many events will
happen before the party, important decisions will be taken,
life-changing revelations will occur and all of it with the background
of incredible Paris decorated for Christmas and the sound of beloved
Christmas songs and some unforgettable Russian and Jewish songs.
Danièle Thompson directed a marvelous movie for which she and her son
Christian (who also stars) wrote a script. Three beautiful and talented
actresses play the sisters. Sabine Azéma is Lyuba, the older of the
three (the songs that she performers in a Russian cabaret almost reduce
me to tears), Emmanuelle Béart is Sonya, the only one of the sisters
who seems to have found happiness in her picture perfect family life
but there is more than meets the eye. Charlotte Gainsbourg (the
daughter of Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, a very talented young
actress whom I like in everything I've seen her) is Milla, the youngest
sister, a brilliant computer programmer, the rebel and the loner who
spends all her time at work.

How charming to walk from Christmas-decorated 5th Avenue into the Paris
Theater on 58th St. to see Christmas-decorated Paris in ""La Bûche"" with
its soundtrack of American Christmas standards. <br><br>I've been told the title refers to the Yule Log, as in ""La Bûche de
Noel,"" but evidently everyone but me just knows this and it's never
mentioned, let alone translated in the movie. It's a very French, very
laugh-out loud funny ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" or a French Christmas
take on the Thanksgiving in ""What's Cooking."" <br><br>Characters speak to the camera to explain the back story on the
intertwined family of ex's and affairs and siblings and step-parents,
adult children, aging parents (with lives! how very not Hollywood!) and
babies. Characters learn about each other, some change their minds and
attitudes based on that information, some don't, and family dysfunction
continues with not Hollywood endings, but rather endings that make
sense for each character's sanity, so are more like real life than
Hollywood. Any re-make will take away all the messy charm and focus on
the Christmas Eve dinner which unpredictably here turns into an
anti-climax. <br><br>This is a delight, as the blurbs would say, but with a warning that it
is a chick flick --the men are secondary, though quite rounded and not
unsympathetic characters. <br><br>Stay for the long cute joke in the credits, but I had to infer it
because it wasn't translated, so I couldn't tell how satirical it was.<br><br>(originally written 12/3/2000)

The English title is a good one, as despite the great opening scenes in
Paris, it really is a film about how people deal with the extra stress
Christmas seems to bring, or as the characters describe it, a ""hostile
depression"". I could enjoy seeing this as a Christmas tradition! My
rating is actually a 7.5, if that was an option. The film is a little
understated, in that typically French way.<br><br>I like the way the actors do a reminiscence directly to the camera and
the audience, especially Francoise Fabian and Claude Rich, who play the
couple who have been split up for 25 years but who have not seen each

Three sisters of Russian parentage; one married but not too happily,
one having an affair with a married man who'll never leave his wife and
one without a man at all and unhappy; all three longing for something
... I like to think that Daniele Thompson wrote this charmer with her
tongue in her cheekhov but who knows. What I do know is that together
with son Christopher Thompson, who also has a featured role, she has
hit one out of the park in her first at bat. We shouldn't be too
surprised, she wrote her first screenplay at the age of 24 and Le
Grande Vadrouille, directed by her father and ex-actor Gerard Oury was
one of the biggest hits in France and is still aired regularly. Along
the way she has written such comedies as La Folie de grandeurs, Le
Cerveau, Les Adventures de Rabbi Jacob plus the more mainstream Cousin,
Cousine, La Boum, Les Marmottes, La Reine Margot, Belle Maman, Ceux qui
m'aiment prendront le train (Those Who Love Me Can Take The Train) and
Decalage Horaire, solid credits whichever way you slice it. La Buche
begins on December 20, with a funeral. The widow, Yvette (Francoise
Fabian) is joined initially by two of her daughters, Louba (Sabine
Azema) the eldest and Sonia (Emmanuelle Beart), the middle one. With
the ceremony all but over the youngest, Milla (Charlotte Gainsbourg)
arrives wearing a miniskirt, as Sonia bitches to Louba later. The
deceased is, in fact, the stepfather of the three girls, their parents
having been divorced some 25 years previously. The respective
characters are limmned economically and expertly. Sonia, the successful
one who buys groceries wholesale to save FF300, Louba the hopeless
romantic who sings Russian songs in a Russian restaurant and has been
involved with a married man, Gilbert (Jean-Pierre Larroussin) for 12
years and Milla, the youngest and most rebellious who is also
successful but chooses to live, according to Sonia, in a rat hole. The
film chronicles the family during the build-up to Christmas and
naturally everyone has their own problems; Louba, at 42, has become
pregnant but feels unable to tell her lover - Gilbert is an up-market
estate agent and their trysts take place in well-appointed apartments
in between sales and Thompson extracts a little gently mileage out of
Azema bringing her own bed linen and packing it the next morning -
Sonia's marriage is on the rocks, Milla is so lonely she canvasses
casual work colleagues as to their availability for Christmas whilst
Stanislaus, the girl's natural father, who during his marriage was a
serial adulterer, remains bitter even after 25 years and subjects
Louba, who lives with him, to an ongoing barrage of bile. Even the
tenant, Joseph (Christopher Thompson), who has become an unofficial
carer for Stanislaus, has problems in the shape of ex-wife Annabelle
(Isabelle Carre) who has custody except at Christmas when she is
reluctant to surrender it. Thompson weaves these separate strands
expertly into a huge, warm blanket and contrives to deal with most if
not all of the problems. A stunning debut with acting honors divided
equally with all hands well worth five stars. 8/10

I was just reading other comments made about this movie, and
they were so negative that made me want to try and say a couple of
words to say that the movie is great, entertaining, interesting,
funny, original. A perfect plot, mastered with capacity and played at
perfection. If you want to see a movie that shows how the magic of
life beats the magic of christmas, go to see the movie, and be
ready to face entangled plots of lives humoristically
interwined.

Every year, American TV serves up so-called holiday fare, meaning
made-for-TV
movies about Brady Bunch-like families getting together for Christmas.
Most
are so forgettable that they get thrown out faster than used Christmas
wrapping.<br><br>The French are in general much better at dealing on film with human
relationships and the complexities of modern families and so I guess it
should come as no surprise that they put together a far more engrossing
story of a Christmas gathering.<br><br>Daniele Thompson's ""La Buche"" delves into the complex relationships in one
family which is just days away form Christmas when the stepfather dies.
The
film opens humorously at his funeral, which for some is a time of mourning
and for others,just a great, big inconvenience.<br><br>There are three intriguing daughters in this family and all of them lead
complex lives, propelled along by the same thing that propels most French
films -- love.  The oldest daughter, played by Sabine Azema, is a 42-year
old singer in a Russian cabaret who has been having an affair for 12 years
with a married man.  The middle sister, Emmanuelle Beart, is the woman who
appears to have everything: beauty, wealth, husband, kids and the kind of
controlling personality that keeps them all dancing to her tune. The
youngest sister, Charlotte Gainsberg, is a vaguely rebellious young,
motorcycle riding loner who has no man of her own, but would like one.
Then
there's their real father, Claude Riche, a guy who apparently during his
active years bedded more women than Magic Johnson.<br><br>American holiday movies usually include some family members in crisis and
a
lot of family members sharing recriminations about past transgressions.
""La
Buche"" serves up its share of both, but with a French twist. Everyone in
this family has their share of sins to confess and forgiveness to seek and
in some cases, even monumental decisions to face.  But they all seem to do
it not only with style and grace, but with a lot of humor thrown in for
good
measure. If this holiday film has a message, it seems to be that you can
make the best of any situation if you try hard enough.<br><br>The acting and directing here are first rate and the characters,
especially
the three daughters, are so intriguing you almost don't want the film to
end.  You want to find out how all three daughters handle the changes
coming
to their lives.<br><br>That's probably the best thing you can say about any film and hats off to
director Thompson for making it so with ""La Buche.""<br><br>

Danielle Thompson has written a lot for the cinema. Some of her best
efforts have been ""La Reine Margot"", ""Le cerveau"", and ""Cousin,
cousine"", among others. Ms. Thompson, whose first directorial job this
is, wanted, perhaps, to give her public a good dramatic comedy when she
undertook this project. The results are somewhat pleasing.<br><br>The story centers about three sisters that are as different from one
another as they are from their mother. Louba, Sonia and Milla have gone
to have their own lives, but when they are reunited on December 20th,
just before Christmas, they show they care for one another in more ways
than we realize.<br><br>Sabina Azema, Emmanuelle Beart and Charlotte Gainsbourg play the three
siblings with style. The lovely Francoise Fabian is seen as their
mother. Also in the cast, Claude Rich and the director's son,
Christopher Thompson.<br><br>Ms. Thompson gives us a different take on Christmas, something we don't
often see on the screen.

My favorite holiday movie for modern times!, February 1, 2005 <br><br>Reviewer:   Glutton for books - See all my reviews <br><br>The first time I watched ""La Buche,"" was a few days before Christmas in
2000, when I was not able to visit the family for Christmas. I saw it
with a French friend who was not able to go home either. It is an
absolutely delightful French movie about the pressures associated with
the holiday season, with thought -provoking characters. Much of it will
make you laugh, but I hesitate to define it as a comedy, because the
term implies a simplicity which the film exceeds by including many
dramatic aspects of life; chief of these are questions of identity,
what makes us happy in life, and who are family and what are they for. <br><br>The core of the plot is members of a family spending the Christmas
together, who have not shared a Christams celebration in many years. La
Buche refers to a type of Christmas cake often eaten in France during
Christmas. For the uninitiated, the French please excuse my
description, it resembles a large Liitle Debbie Swiss roll. The
characters of the film, like family life, are full of unexpected
surprises. <br><br>Yvette, mother of the family is grieving from the loss of her second
husband, and the film opens at a funeral. Her deceased husband was a
musician, as was her first husband. The person may have died but it
seems that the jealousy lives on. The father of the family, Stanislas,
is the mother's first husband. He usually spends the Christmas alone
with his favorite daughter, Milla, believing that it should not be an
stressful time for him because he is Jewish, trying unsuccessfully each
year to avoid the pressure associated with the holiday and its memories
of its painful past, such as when he left his life in Russia behind as
an child immigrant with no possessions. This year he takes a different
approach to Christmas, due to a near death experience, the recent
widowhood of Yvette, and determination to make amends for mistakes from
his past. <br><br>Neither parent was a perfect spouse, but the children (who are grown
adults) have varying perceptions of who is the better person. There are
three daughters: Milla views her mother with contempt, Sonia faults the
father, and Louba seems equally devoted to both. <br><br>Sonia and Milla seem the epitome of success; one with an apparently
ideal marriage and family, one with a thriving career. The other
daughter, Louba, appears to be the least ambitious and successful in
life. But what really constitutes ideas like ambition, success, and
happiness? How should these values to be qualified? What guarantees do
we have for stability in life in our pursuit or implementation of such
qualities? Apparently, one of Stanislas' most cherished Christmas
memories was when as a poor child he received one simple toy, and the
gift of a safe place to spend the night. <br><br>In addition to the traditional family, there is Joseph a boarder to
whom Stanislas rents his former music studio, and who has a young child
from a previous marriage and desperately wants to spend Christmas with
her. Joseph rushes Stanislas to the hospital and saves his life; a
service which makes the daughters curious to learn more about him and
his life. <br><br>To delve too much into explaining the characters of the film, gives
away much of the film's surprises that make it so enjoyable. In true
form to good characterization, no one is exactly whom they first appear
to be, and learning who they really are is the best part of the viewing
experience. <br><br>There is much stress during the holiday season to pretend that life is
working out according to plans and that you are happy, because it is a
time for celebration. Even those who are not formally religious
experience this pressure during the holiday season. <br><br>This movie examines that phenomena and makes you feel that you are not
an anomaly for feeling tension associated with encountering family
during that time of the year. By the end of the film, you feel it is
okay to admit the problems that pretension of perfection exerts on your
life, even if it is Christmas. In fact, the film teaches that the
ability to share your imperfections and sorrows, as well as your hidden
aspirations is part of what constitutes a family, and exercising this
ability cements your familial relations for the better. Despite the
gravity of the characters' problems and conflicts, this is ultimately a
great feel-good film, that can be enjoyed at any time of the year.

Three sisters, the Parisians with the sweet Russian names, Sonya, Lyuba
and Milla and their parents who have been divorced for 25 years but
still have a lot to say to each other are in the center of this
charming, clever, funny, touching and poignant dramedy that takes place
one year in Paris from December 20 till Christmas Eve. It will start
with the funeral and it will end with the Christmas party in which all
members of this dysfunctional family participate but many events will
happen before the party, important decisions will be taken,
life-changing revelations will occur and all of it with the background
of incredible Paris decorated for Christmas and the sound of beloved
Christmas songs and some unforgettable Russian and Jewish songs.
Danièle Thompson directed a marvelous movie for which she and her son
Christian (who also stars) wrote a script. Three beautiful and talented
actresses play the sisters. Sabine Azéma is Lyuba, the older of the
three (the songs that she performers in a Russian cabaret almost reduce
me to tears), Emmanuelle Béart is Sonya, the only one of the sisters
who seems to have found happiness in her picture perfect family life
but there is more than meets the eye. Charlotte Gainsbourg (the
daughter of Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, a very talented young
actress whom I like in everything I've seen her) is Milla, the youngest
sister, a brilliant computer programmer, the rebel and the loner who
spends all her time at work.

How charming to walk from Christmas-decorated 5th Avenue into the Paris
Theater on 58th St. to see Christmas-decorated Paris in ""La Bûche"" with
its soundtrack of American Christmas standards. <br><br>I've been told the title refers to the Yule Log, as in ""La Bûche de
Noel,"" but evidently everyone but me just knows this and it's never
mentioned, let alone translated in the movie. It's a very French, very
laugh-out loud funny ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" or a French Christmas
take on the Thanksgiving in ""What's Cooking."" <br><br>Characters speak to the camera to explain the back story on the
intertwined family of ex's and affairs and siblings and step-parents,
adult children, aging parents (with lives! how very not Hollywood!) and
babies. Characters learn about each other, some change their minds and
attitudes based on that information, some don't, and family dysfunction
continues with not Hollywood endings, but rather endings that make
sense for each character's sanity, so are more like real life than
Hollywood. Any re-make will take away all the messy charm and focus on
the Christmas Eve dinner which unpredictably here turns into an
anti-climax. <br><br>This is a delight, as the blurbs would say, but with a warning that it
is a chick flick --the men are secondary, though quite rounded and not
unsympathetic characters. <br><br>Stay for the long cute joke in the credits, but I had to infer it
because it wasn't translated, so I couldn't tell how satirical it was.<br><br>(originally written 12/3/2000)

The English title is a good one, as despite the great opening scenes in
Paris, it really is a film about how people deal with the extra stress
Christmas seems to bring, or as the characters describe it, a ""hostile
depression"". I could enjoy seeing this as a Christmas tradition! My
rating is actually a 7.5, if that was an option. The film is a little
understated, in that typically French way.<br><br>I like the way the actors do a reminiscence directly to the camera and
the audience, especially Francoise Fabian and Claude Rich, who play the
couple who have been split up for 25 years but who have not seen each
other since, even though they have 3 daughters.<br><br>I also liked Sabine Azema, who I just realized I had seen very recently

In 1904, in Dublin, James Joyce chats up Nora Barnacle, a hotel maid recently come from Galway. She enchants him with her frank, direct and uninhibited manner, and before long, he's convinced her to come with him to Trieste, where he has a job with Berlitz. Over time, Nora pulls him through phobias, tolerates his drinking, takes in his brother Stan, and bests Joyce at 'the writin' game' to bring him back to Italy from Dublin where he's gone to open a cinema. But his sexual jealousy threatens the relationship and sends her back to Galway with the children. Is there any way to tame Jim's green-eyed monster? And, will the lad ever get his stories published?                Written by

It was another Nureyev defection of sorts!Scott is low-key on the subject of his sexuality. ""Mercifully, these days people don\'t see being gay as a character flaw. But nor is it a virtue, like kindness. Or a talent, like playing the banjo. It\'s just a fact. Of course, it\'s part of my make-up, but I don\'t want to trade on it. I am a private person; I think that\'s important if you\'re an actor. But there\'s a difference between privacy and secrecy, and I\'m not a secretive person. Really I just want to get on with my job, which is to pretend to be lots of different people. Simple as that.""      He has lived in London for the past decade with his partner, who is ""sort of"" in the business. ""And that\'s all you\'re getting."" He clams up. ""It sounds maybe a little old fashioned, but the parts I want to play and I do play, you don\'t want to inject too much of your own personality. What you sacrifice then is a slight mystery.""      People get distracted by box-office figures and take jobs because they think it will advance their careers. Of course, it\'s nice to get a big cheque and be able to buy a massive house, but my view is that we\'re not here long, so why not do something of value?      I\'m an enthusiast for people, and I don\'t want them to become the enemy. I\'ve seen that happen to colleagues who are disturbed the whole time, but there\'s a certain degree of control you can have if you keep yourself to yourself. The kind of actors I admire move through different characters and genres. That\'s the kind of actor I try to be. If you want that, you have to be circumspect about your private life.      [when asked about fans] You get the occasional odd person.      [From an interview with the Sunday Mirror (London, England) from Oct. 8, 2000] I had a girlfriend in Dublin but I\'ve been on my own for three years now.      I do sometimes play characters that are a bit ambiguous. You\'ve got to be brave about that sort of stuff. I like the sense of people not feeling too secure, not immediately knowing what they have in front of them.      I\'m not a big guy for research. You\'ve got to take a risk.      It\'s a thrilling world, and people really like stories about secrets, which is the essence of a spy drama.      The goal is always just trying to stretch yourself as an actor.      I\'ve played all these extreme guys, but playing an every man type has its own challenges.      Life\'s too short.      Never, ever wear three-quarter length trousers. Even in the summer.      I find any sort of acting that doesn\'t have any humor in it is mind numbingly boring.      People get distracted by box-office figures and take jobs because they think it will advance their careers.      I want to keep everything balanced. That\'s why it\'s important not to have too much fanfare.      The kind of actors I admire move through different characters and genres.      I don\'t like it when people ask actors to work for free - on the fringe - as if it\'s some kind of virtue. That annoys me - actors should be paid well.      \'Serious acting\' is the kind of acting that I don\'t ever respond to.      I like clothes.      It\'s very difficult to make comedy work; I think it\'s a very underrated genre.      If one story becomes too hot, then you can\'t forget it. As an actor, you want to remain fluid.      One of my favorite parts of acting is the clothes that you get to wear, because it\'s very important.      I can totally understand why people say: \'I\'m going to do this T.V. series so that I can buy a flat\'. But you\'ve got to see what\'s of value to you as an actor.      Audiences like to be challenged and to be actively involved and try to guess an outcome.

Joyce is best known for Ulysses (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of Homer\'s Odyssey are paralleled in an array of contrasting literary styles, perhaps most prominent among these the stream of consciousness technique he perfected. Other major works are the short-story collection Dubliners (1914), and the novels A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and Finnegans Wake (1939). His complete oeuvre also includes three books of poetry, a play, occasional journalism, and his published letters.Joyce was born into a middle class family in Dublin, where he excelled as a student at the Jesuit schools Clongowes and Belvedere, then at University College Dublin. In his early twenties he emigrated permanently to continental Europe, living in Trieste, Paris and Zurich. Though most of his adult life was spent abroad, Joyce\'s fictional universe does not extend far beyond Dublin, and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there; Ulysses in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city. Shortly after the publication of Ulysses he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat, saying, ""For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal.""""']","[[<bound method Tag.get_text of <p>
I've read some of the comments pro and con already made on this movie
and am glad some viewers liked it. I thought it very fine indeed, but
agree that some prior knowledge of James Joyce, his life and work, is
helpful. Joyce's writing is not a bore, as some of the comments
suggest. The story ""The Dead,"" from Joyce's collection ""Dubliners,"" is
one of the great short stories in English literature. It is referrd to
several times in this film. (Incidentally, ""The Dead"" has been made
into a film also.) The time of the film ""Nora"", when Joyce was trying
to find a publisher for ""Dubliners"", was well before the writing of his
great work, ""Ulysses"". It was a time when Joyce and Nora Barnacle had a
stormy relationship, but nevertheless were deeply in love and had a
lusty relationship with each other. This is well depicted in the movie,
beginning with their first date, when Nora surprises and delights Joyce
with her bold advances. Ewan McGregor and Susan Lynch play these scenes
with high professional skill, helping us to really understand the
delight these two people had in a physical relationship. Their love is
an up and down affair but endures. McGregor is a fine actor who always
give 100% in whatever his role may be and in ""Nora"" he does not
disappoint. I was struck by the way he squinted occasionally, just as
Joyce must have done with his terrible eyesight, which even in these
early years had begun to deteriorate badly. Susan Lynch is new to me
and very convincing as the servant girl from the Irish countryside who
kept up to the challenges of life with a great intellectual. One
objection: I viewed this film on DVD and was unhappy that there are no
captions for the hard of hearing--or for those who have trouble with
Irish brogues!! There were a couple of the Trieste scenes where Italian
conversation did have English language captions. A great relief! But is
it really too great an expense for DVD producers to routinely include
the caption option?

This is a beautiful film. Beautiful in the way it was directed, played
and photographed.<br><br>Some of the photography, by cinematographer Jean-Francois Robin, could
remind the viewer of the most famous of impressionist paintings of the
time with couples strolling in the late afternoon fading sun in that
magic hour of light when day is slowly but surely turning into night.<br><br>The story is essentially about Nora and we are introduced early on to
the inspiration of the Michael Furey character from The Dead. This is
shown in flashback, just as it is in the original story, as the
physically bruised Nora Barnacle leaves Galway for Dublin after a
beating from her father.<br><br>We are not sure just how far Nora's sexual experiences with the young
man went but when she eventually meets James Joyce on that famous
original Bloomsday of June 16th 1904, when the Ascot Gold Cup was being
won by Throwaway, when Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus were wandering
elsewhere around Dublin she does something so memorable and orgasmic to
the genius Jim that it plants the seeds of jealousy in his mind that
will haunt and taunt their relationship even to the point of James
questioning whether their eldest child, Giorgio, is in fact his. If she
did that to me she would do it to anybody is his reasoning.<br><br>There are some fine multi layered performances by the two leading
characters, Ewan McGregor and Susan Lynch, who are ably supported by
Peter McDonald as Jim's long suffering but supportive brother Stanny
(Stanislaus). With one turn of the head and a slight look in the eye
McGregor shows the character's insecurity with the relationship and the
return look from Lynch lets him know, and the audience, that he is
being unreasonable. Nora believes that James invents the situations to
give him fuel for his stories but there is a growing torment of the
young artist there with his displays of paranoia about Dublin, his fear
of 'things with horns' and his child like panic when he is caught in a
thunder storm. These three things and maybe his writing with its stream
of consciousness tell us that this, indeed, is not a reasonable man.<br><br>There was hardly any mention, however, of the eye problems that James
Joyce suffered from throughout his life. His fear of blindness, that he
eventually almost reached, might have shown his urgency to get things
down on paper. But this is such a small complaint in a wonderful movie
so lovingly written and directed by Pat Murphy without one word of
James Joyce being used in the script. There are a few little hints,
which copyright cannot affect, when we see the few lines: 'Europe, The
World, The Universe' which comes from 'A Portrait Of The Artist as a
Young Man' and we see Nora save a manuscript from the fire. A
manuscript that would be the first draft of 'Portrait' and which
eventually saw the light of day as 'Stephen Hero.'

Writer's lives are always a difficult subject for the screen, and even with
the wealth of biographical and autobiographical material about James Joyce,
he remains no exception. This movie, concentrating on the early part of his
relationship with the humorously-monikered Nora barnacle makes a reasonable
enough attempt to bring cinematic life to this complex and enigmatic figure.<br><br>Ewan McGregor, in the role of Joyce is sometimes a bit too young and sexy to
convey his subjects brooding, promethean intensity, but he's certainly more
convincing than Bosco Hogan in Joseph Strick's Portrait of an artist. The
real star of the film is Susan Lynch, whose earthy sexuality convinces us
that she could develop into the Molly Bloom of Ulysses. There's
also good support from the actor playing Joyce's more level-headed brother
and soi-disant ""keeper"", Stanislaus.<br><br>The movie is often affected by the exaggerated Irishness that seems to
blight every movie set in the island, but it doesn't get in the way of the
film's
verisimilitude too much, with one exception. When Joyce's brother takes his
book to an Irish publisher, he is told that ""there's something dirty going
on"" in ""The Dead"" and this is presented as a uniquely Irish reaction, though
in reality Joyce had the same reaction everywhere.<br><br>The film is also punctuated by subtle allusions to Joyces work that literati
will enjoy picking up, but won't alienate those poor hordes of non-Joyceans
too much. At the risk of sounding like a swotty pedant, there's a lot of
profane language in the movie, which Joyce maintained he never used in
speech, though it serves, if anything to increase the characters'
believability.

At a superficial level the film is richly evocative of the physical and
cultural settings of Dublin, Ireland and Trieste, Italy; and of the
strong contrasts between the two places. Dublin's streets are gritty,
dark and damp, its people dress in shades of black and grey. Trieste is
bright and airy, and people find it natural that rooms should connect
via exterior balconies. But unfortunately when James Joyce tried to
escape Dublin he carried his Irish neuroses with him in his cases.<br><br>Nora Barnacle is hearty, strong, sensuous and highly adaptable. As a
biography of her, this film concentrates on the generous support and
protection that she gives, and promises to give, to a fearful,
complicated man given to outrageous sexual jealousy--James Joyce.<br><br>Nora and James might seem poorly matched and perhaps it is the
combination of her own jealousy for his letters--and their intense
physical relationship--that binds them. <br><br>None of us could expect to predict a stable outcome, could we? Yet they
lived together for their entire adult lives.

How one views this film will depend in part on how much of a Joyce devotee
the viewer is.  As is the case with any film based on the life of a
larger-than-life figure, the film will be largely viewed by those who have
an avid interest in James Joyce.  These viewers will judge the film with a
much more discerning eye.  The fact that Joyce's work does not have mass
appeal and is devoured by a small but fervent group of literary
intellectuals makes the scrutiny that much more intense.  For this audience,
the film will have numerous unbearable flaws and inaccuracies.<br><br>However, for the audience of non aficionados, this film has a great deal to
recommend itself, providing that the viewer loves good drama and has the
patience to endure its methodical pacing.  The story is a powerful love
story with shearing forces that bring emotional torrent to the relationship.
 In it we find the high minded writer, James Joyce, obsessed with Nora, the
coarse and illiterate chamber maid whose practical wisdom and unfettered
sexuality provide the ideal compliment and the perfect wedge.  These two are
helpless moths being consumed by a bonfire of ardor built on differences
that are as irreconcilable as they are essential to each of their souls. 
Given this premise, we have the underpinnings of great
theater.<br><br>Despite the disappointment of many Joyce fans regarding this treatment, the
film is really not about James Joyce, it is about the relationship. 
Thankfully, director Pat Murphy didn't lose sight of that fact and succumb
to the temptation to mollify Joyce fans by making this a Joyce-centric film.
 Murphy patiently peels away the layers of each character and casts each
revelation on the relationship like kerosene on a house fire.  The deeper we
get into the characters, the more complex and hopeless the relationship
becomes, and paradoxically, the more inextricably entwined its participants.
 <br><br>Murphy's direction is excellent on all fronts.  The cinematography is
incredible with awe inspiring locations and a wonderfully rich sepia quality
that enhances the period renderings.  The look and feel the period is well
done.  The early 20th century costumes, furniture, sets and props are
precise and breathe life and realism into each scene.<br><br>The acting is superb.  Ewan McGregor practically rips himself to shreds
playing the mercurial Joyce, jovial and charming one minute, paranoid,
brooding and insanely jealous the next.  However, poor Ewan once again has a
terrific performance upstaged by his co-star Susan Lynch (See Nicole Kidman
and ""Moulin Rouge!"").<br><br>Despite lacking the classic features of a leading lady, Lynch's physiognomy
is a perfect match for the earthy Nora.  Lynch can flat out act.  This lady
has a five octave emotional range with the force of Caribbean hurricane.  If
there weren't a single other reason to see this film, her performance would
be enough.<br><br>I am glad that I happened on to this film buried in the stacks at the video
store.  I rated it a 9/10.  It isn't for everyone, but for those who can
appreciate a fatalistic love story with steamy sexual content, constant
emotional tension, great acting and insightful directing; this will be a
disturbing, but worthwhile experience.

I was also most fortunate to attend the screening on Aug. 23 in Sydney.
Ewan's words at the end of the film really illuminated the motives and the
intense belief shown by the director Pat Murphy and the lead actors for
this
lovingly crafted film.<br><br>At first, the tale seems simple enough. Two people are in love. Love,
however, has a habit of not coming into people's lives in a logical
fashion.
Hence, the literary genius whose muse is a country girl turned chambermaid.
This situation prompts  questions/doubts at many levels -  for the
audience,
the friends and family of Joyce and Nora, and the lovers
themselves.<br><br>This is why I feel it is necessary to view the film more than once. The
understanding of this love requires thought. It is an hypnotic story, at
times confronting as the different modes of realisation, elation, torment
and rejection of love are lived through by the duo as they flow in and out
of synch. with one another.<br><br>It should be pointed out that the film's title, 'Nora' should
be
accepted as a signpost that this film does NOT focus on Joyce. It is the
significance to Nora of this union and the effect of her existence upon
Joyce which is the true focus.<br><br>I highly recommend this film as a most satisfying and very beautifully told
study of an all encompassing real life love affair.

I have to say I was greatly surprised by the extremely low rating average
on
this film's IMDB listing page--I looked at the demographic breakdown and
over half the votes are 5 and above, so how can it possibly be 2.8
average?
I had the opportunity to view Nora overseas a couple of weeks ago and I
must
say I found it compelling, even though its focus confused me a little.<br><br>The storyline kind of went into full gear before we got to know the
characters, but the performances of Ewan McGregor and Susan Lynch were
both
top notch.   The relationship of James and Nora riveted me to my seat.
They
fought like dogs, but they were vibrant and passionate souls whose
relationship endured all sorts of demons.  Nora's soul was bared for the
viewer and Susan Lynch made her one of the strongest female characters I
can
remember by giving Nora vulnerability as well as uncommon emotional
strength.  McGregor did a great job of helping me sympathize with Joyce,
even when he was neurotic and treated his long time love terribly.   I
wish
the beginning of their relationship had been presented more concretely,
but
McGregor and Lynch hooked me anyway.  As it presented the events of their
lives, Nora was top notch.  Not for anyone who is an afficionado of
actions
films, that's for sure.

I was lucky enough to see this at a small time premiere in Sydney and Ewan
turned up as he is out here making some big time sci-fi movie.  Anyway my
first reaction to this movie was that I thought that it moved with a pace
that was too disjointed and that we were confronted with too much intimate
detail before we had a chance to understand anything about the characters.
Afterwards we heard from Ewan and from his expressions of how it was a
glimpse at a life not a tale and how that we are supposed to just capture
moments in what was a very complex and unique relationship that Joyce had
with nora that on further thought I have come to see more into what the
film
was trying to do so on second viewing I was able to understand I suppose
more of the workings of the mind that was Joyce I highly recommend this
film
to anyone with a passion not only for Joyce's work but anyone who has an
interest in the personal life of a creative mind.  Watch it twice for even
more.

Living in the midwestern US, it's not as if I expected to ever get a chance
to see ""Nora"" in the theaters.   To be honest I wasn't that interested in
seeing the film, which I'd heard little about, but during a recent visit
with film fanatic relatives in DC a viewing of ""Nora"" at the Ireland
Festival was on the schedule.<br><br>Gag me, I thought, an ""art film,"" but I have to admit I was  surprised.
I've read a lot of Joyce's work (which I've always liked) so I was
disappointed at first that the film didn't focus more on the creative
process, but the story of Joyce and Nora Barnacle was pretty intriguing in
and of itself.<br><br>I went surfing for info about this nice little film when I got back home;
Susan Lynch is every bit as wonderful as the meager number of net reviews I
could find say she is.   She gives a striking and memorable performance as
the woman who inspired Molly Bloom.   Nora's tenacity in the face of
Joyce's
neuroses and abusive behavior was both awe inspiring and frustrating to
behold; Lynch's brilliant performance alone made the film worth seeing.
Not to say that McGregor wasn't good in the role of Joyce, but if I were
forced to choose one performance over the other in this film to honor it
would be hers. Give McGregor credit for having enough savvy to play his
role
understated enough to allow his co-star to shine.  His ability to imbue the
neurotic and manipulative Joyce with some humanity without going over the
top and stealing Lynch's thunder is noteworthy.    Not many actors could
have pulled this off.  He's one of the few that could.<br><br>""Nora"" has some problems.  It meanders in places and tends to overanalyze
the ""problems in their relationship"" but it is a gorgeous looking film
featuring a volatile partnership that is vibrant and alive if nothing
else--overwrought without being boring,  disarmingly sexy without being too
crass (I did blush in a few places!)   Not a perfect screenplay, but a good
one.   The performances make the film.  I was pleasantly surprised.

it is here.<br><br>But, no narrative adventure here, not the slightest hint of Joyce's world.
This is a staged book, nothing else. No styled sexual tone here -- it is all
left to Ms. Lynch; no help from the director, production designer or

nothing like the commitment of `Vincent and Theo.' There's a push by Joyce
of Nora into a potential sexual adventure. But after Emily Watson in
`Breaking the Waves,' this level of angst seems pretty
highschoolish.<br><br>We are told that Ireland sucks the life out of writers after spawning them
in great numbers, that society is extremely class structured, that Catholic

her, because he knows how her musky strength anchors his brother's abstract

exposed. Completely oblivious to her sex. Stanny is pleased at first: his
reconciliation achieved. Then watch his face as he looks at her briefly but
closely, and realizes her abandon. He sees more pain coming. And to him as
well, `Raging Bull' -wise. (Another friend is drafted for that.) It's a

intellectuals makes the scrutiny that much more intense.  For this audience,
the film will have numerous unbearable flaws and inaccuracies.<br><br>However, for the audience of non aficionados, this film has a great deal to
recommend itself, providing that the viewer loves good drama and has the
patience to endure its methodical pacing.  The story is a powerful love
story with shearing forces that bring emotional torrent to the relationship.
 In it we find the high minded writer, James Joyce, obsessed with Nora, the
coarse and illiterate chamber maid whose practical wisdom and unfettered
sexuality provide the ideal compliment and the perfect wedge.  These two are
helpless moths being consumed by a bonfire of ardor built on differences
that are as irreconcilable as they are essential to each of their souls. 
Given this premise, we have the underpinnings of great
theater.<br><br>Despite the disappointment of many Joyce fans regarding this treatment, the
film is really not about James Joyce, it is about the relationship. 
Thankfully, director Pat Murphy didn't lose sight of that fact and succumb
to the temptation to mollify Joyce fans by making this a Joyce-centric film.
 Murphy patiently peels away the layers of each character and casts each
revelation on the relationship like kerosene on a house fire.  The deeper we
get into the characters, the more complex and hopeless the relationship
becomes, and paradoxically, the more inextricably entwined its participants.
 <br><br>Murphy's direction is excellent on all fronts.  The cinematography is
incredible with awe inspiring locations and a wonderfully rich sepia quality
that enhances the period renderings.  The look and feel the period is well
done.  The early 20th century costumes, furniture, sets and props are
precise and breathe life and realism into each scene.<br><br>The acting is superb.  Ewan McGregor practically rips himself to shreds
playing the mercurial Joyce, jovial and charming one minute, paranoid,
brooding and insanely jealous the next.  However, poor Ewan once again has a
terrific performance upstaged by his co-star Susan Lynch (See Nicole Kidman
and ""Moulin Rouge!"").<br><br>Despite lacking the classic features of a leading lady, Lynch's physiognomy
is a perfect match for the earthy Nora.  Lynch can flat out act.  This lady
has a five octave emotional range with the force of Caribbean hurricane.  If
there weren't a single other reason to see this film, her performance would
be enough.<br><br>I am glad that I happened on to this film buried in the stacks at the video
store.  I rated it a 9/10.  It isn't for everyone, but for those who can
appreciate a fatalistic love story with steamy sexual content, constant
emotional tension, great acting and insightful directing; this will be a
disturbing, but worthwhile experience.

I was also most fortunate to attend the screening on Aug. 23 in Sydney.
Ewan's words at the end of the film really illuminated the motives and the
intense belief shown by the director Pat Murphy and the lead actors for
this
lovingly crafted film.<br><br>At first, the tale seems simple enough. Two people are in love. Love,
however, has a habit of not coming into people's lives in a logical
fashion.
Hence, the literary genius whose muse is a country girl turned chambermaid.
This situation prompts  questions/doubts at many levels -  for the
audience,
the friends and family of Joyce and Nora, and the lovers
themselves.<br><br>This is why I feel it is necessary to view the film more than once. The
understanding of this love requires thought. It is an hypnotic story, at
times confronting as the different modes of realisation, elation, torment
and rejection of love are lived through by the duo as they flow in and out
of synch. with one another.<br><br>It should be pointed out that the film's title, 'Nora' should
be
accepted as a signpost that this film does NOT focus on Joyce. It is the
significance to Nora of this union and the effect of her existence upon
Joyce which is the true focus.<br><br>I highly recommend this film as a most satisfying and very beautifully told
study of an all encompassing real life love affair.

I have to say I was greatly surprised by the extremely low rating average
on
this film's IMDB listing page--I looked at the demographic breakdown and
over half the votes are 5 and above, so how can it possibly be 2.8
average?
I had the opportunity to view Nora overseas a couple of weeks ago and I
must
say I found it compelling, even though its focus confused me a little.<br><br>The storyline kind of went into full gear before we got to know the
characters, but the performances of Ewan McGregor and Susan Lynch were
both
top notch.   The relationship of James and Nora riveted me to my seat.
They
fought like dogs, but they were vibrant and passionate souls whose
relationship endured all sorts of demons.  Nora's soul was bared for the
viewer and Susan Lynch made her one of the strongest female characters I
can
remember by giving Nora vulnerability as well as uncommon emotional
strength.  McGregor did a great job of helping me sympathize with Joyce,
even when he was neurotic and treated his long time love terribly.   I
wish
the beginning of their relationship had been presented more concretely,
but
McGregor and Lynch hooked me anyway.  As it presented the events of their
lives, Nora was top notch.  Not for anyone who is an afficionado of
actions
films, that's for sure.

I was lucky enough to see this at a small time premiere in Sydney and Ewan
turned up as he is out here making some big time sci-fi movie.  Anyway my
first reaction to this movie was that I thought that it moved with a pace
that was too disjointed and that we were confronted with too much intimate
detail before we had a chance to understand anything about the characters.
Afterwards we heard from Ewan and from his expressions of how it was a
glimpse at a life not a tale and how that we are supposed to just capture
moments in what was a very complex and unique relationship that Joyce had
with nora that on further thought I have come to see more into what the
film
was trying to do so on second viewing I was able to understand I suppose
more of the workings of the mind that was Joyce I highly recommend this
film
to anyone with a passion not only for Joyce's work but anyone who has an
interest in the personal life of a creative mind.  Watch it twice for even
more.

Living in the midwestern US, it's not as if I expected to ever get a chance
to see ""Nora"" in the theaters.   To be honest I wasn't that interested in
seeing the film, which I'd heard little about, but during a recent visit
with film fanatic relatives in DC a viewing of ""Nora"" at the Ireland
Festival was on the schedule.<br><br>Gag me, I thought, an ""art film,"" but I have to admit I was  surprised.
I've read a lot of Joyce's work (which I've always liked) so I was
disappointed at first that the film didn't focus more on the creative
process, but the story of Joyce and Nora Barnacle was pretty intriguing in
and of itself.<br><br>I went surfing for info about this nice little film when I got back home;
Susan Lynch is every bit as wonderful as the meager number of net reviews I
could find say she is.   She gives a striking and memorable performance as
the woman who inspired Molly Bloom.   Nora's tenacity in the face of
Joyce's
neuroses and abusive behavior was both awe inspiring and frustrating to
behold; Lynch's brilliant performance alone made the film worth seeing.
Not to say that McGregor wasn't good in the role of Joyce, but if I were
forced to choose one performance over the other in this film to honor it
would be hers. Give McGregor credit for having enough savvy to play his
role
understated enough to allow his co-star to shine.  His ability to imbue the
neurotic and manipulative Joyce with some humanity without going over the
top and stealing Lynch's thunder is noteworthy.    Not many actors could
have pulled this off.  He's one of the few that could.<br><br>""Nora"" has some problems.  It meanders in places and tends to overanalyze
the ""problems in their relationship"" but it is a gorgeous looking film
featuring a volatile partnership that is vibrant and alive if nothing
else--overwrought without being boring,  disarmingly sexy without being too
crass (I did blush in a few places!)   Not a perfect screenplay, but a good
one.   The performances make the film.  I was pleasantly surprised.

Spoilers herein.<br><br>Such promise!<br><br>Here is Ewan Mcgregor and the project he made for himself. He has been in
two of the finest films of the last decade (`Pillow Book' and `Moulin
Rouge'), has some skill and shows commitment to classy projects. Says a lot
positive that he became engaged in this, helped create
it.<br><br>But the project has too many government commissions involved, so a rampant
conservatism governs. If anywhere were a place to use adventuresome
narrative devices, it is here. If anywhere were a place to engender a tone
of sexual hypnotism (and the maturing of the relationship into something
tenable between a damaged mind and a relatively illiterate emotional being)
it is here.<br><br>But, no narrative adventure here, not the slightest hint of Joyce's world.
This is a staged book, nothing else. No styled sexual tone here -- it is all
left to Ms. Lynch; no help from the director, production designer or
cinematographer. <br><br>Oh there's some scant hint of expressionism, which is wholly inapt and
nothing like the commitment of `Vincent and Theo.' There's a push by Joyce
of Nora into a potential sexual adventure. But after Emily Watson in
`Breaking the Waves,' this level of angst seems pretty
highschoolish.<br><br>We are told that Ireland sucks the life out of writers after spawning them
in great numbers, that society is extremely class structured, that Catholic
mores create guilty, silent promiscuity. That Dublin and these forces will
drive the world that Joyce creates and we will consume. That out of this
world comes `new words,' in fact a whole new manner of reading.<br><br>But we SEE none of it. Why make a film?<br><br>Lynch did her best, since she had no help. Wish Kate Blancett was there.
McDonald (Stanny) had the best moments, which he usually didn't have the
depth to mine, like Sean Penn would have. Ironically, he played the `Nora'
role in `Felicia's Journey' just before this project.<br><br>One scene is special.<br><br>Stanny has discovered Nora depressed and Lucia abandoned. He has consoled
her, because he knows how her musky strength anchors his brother's abstract
world. He is talking Lucia into eating just a scoch of spaghetti, when Nora
bursts in with a positive letter from James. She is in her underfrock, pubis
exposed. Completely oblivious to her sex. Stanny is pleased at first: his
reconciliation achieved. Then watch his face as he looks at her briefly but
closely, and realizes her abandon. He sees more pain coming. And to him as
well, `Raging Bull' -wise. (Another friend is drafted for that.) It's a
great scene. Wish we had more of it.

Brother to Shannon Lee. In 1970-71, they moved to Hong Kong where Brandon became fluent in Cantonese by the age of 8. He attended Boston\'s Art-Oriented Emerson College in Massachusetts. He studied Martial Arts and drama, like his father. In 1983, he was expelled from school because of misbehavior, but received his diploma at Miraleste High School. He was in Rapid Fire (1992), Showdown in Little Tokyo (1991) and a few more films, including The Crow (1994). He turned down offers to be in Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story (1993). Bruce died (while filming) at the age of 32, of what is to be believed, a brain hemorrhage. Brandon died at the age of 28 on the set of The Crow (1994). The film crew shot a scene in which it was decided to use a gun without consent from the weapons coordinator, who had been sent home early that night. They handed Michael Massee the gun loaded with full power blanks and shot the scene, unaware that a bullet had become dislodged from a previous shot and had lodged itself in the barrel. Upon shooting of the scene the blank round forced the bullet out the barrel striking Brandon Lee. The crew only noticed when Lee was slow getting up. The doctors worked desperately for five hours, but it was no use. The bullet had lodged itself in Mr Lee\'s lower spine. He was pronounced dead at 1:04 P.M. the next day. He was supposed to marry Eliza Hutton on April 17, 1993. His body was flown to Seattle to be buried beside his father in Lake View Cemetery.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Caryn Liles <kml@io.org>                    Born in Oakland, California, USA, Brandon Lee spent the first eight years of his life in Hong Kong. By the time he was able to walk, he was already involved in learning about martial arts from his father, martial arts expert and famed actor Bruce Lee. After Bruce Lee\'s untimely death, Brandon, his mother Linda Lee Cadwell (an American of Swedish heritage), and his sister Shannon Lee moved to Los Angeles. He attended high school in Los Angeles, where he realized that he had also inherited acting ability along with his martial arts skills. He continued his education and interest in acting at Emerson College in Massachusetts, where he majored in theatre. Having chosen an acting career, Lee took his work seriously. He studied at the Strasberg Academy, with Eric Morris in New York and in Los Angeles, and in Lynette Katselas\' class in Los Angeles. His first professional job as an actor came at age twenty, when casting director Lynn Stalmaster asked him to read for a CBS television film, Kung Fu: The Movie (1986). Lee\'s first role in a feature film was Long zai jiang hu (1986) (aka ""Legacy of Rage"" (1986)) for D.M. Films of Hong Kong, followed by a co-starring role in Showdown in Little Tokyo (1991).- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Anonymous          Trade Mark (2)        Usually played a character on the wrong side of the law        Many remember his death occurred while acting, a real bullet hit his spinal cord.Trivia (23)      Son of Bruce Lee and Linda Lee Cadwell.      Killed while filming the movie The Crow (1994) by a projectile shot from a gun firing blanks.      Lived in Hong Kong for a couple of years as a little boy.      Spoke Cantonese.      At the time of his death, was engaged to Eliza Hutton.      Older brother of Shannon Lee.      Interred at Lake View Cemetery, Seattle, Washington, USA.      His Chinese star sign is the Dragon. He was born on Chinese New Year\'s eve, last day of the dragon.      Was first asked to play the role of Bruce Lee in his father\'s biopic. The role was later given to Jason Scott Lee.      Was in talks with filmmakers about making Rapid Fire 2.      Was to be married to Eliza Hutton in Mexico on April 17, 1993.      Dedication at the end of Lee\'s last film, The Crow (1994), reads ""For Brandon and Eliza (Hutton)"".      Brandon\'s father was of Chinese, and some European (usually described as German), descent. Brandon\'s mother, who is caucasian, has English, Irish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Dutch ancestry. Brandon was born with blond hair. As he aged, his hair color changed to brown.      The apple never falls far from the tree: Brandon played the character ""Jake Lo"" in Rapid Fire (1992); his father Bruce Lee played the character ""Billy Lo"" in Game of Death (1978).      Nephew of Robert Lee      Grandson of actor Hoi-Chuen Lee.      Growing up in Bruce\'s shadow wasn\'t always easy for the younger Lee. As a child, Brandon was about to sign up with a local martial-arts studio...until he noticed a large poster of his dad on the wall; Brandon ran from the dojo in tears. Later, as a teenager, he dropped out of two different high-schools (once, after an ""altercation"" with the vice-principal).      He was a troubled youngster but an outstanding surrogate-parent. When his actress-sister Shannon Lee and a friend were arrested for underage- joyriding in their mom\'s car, Brandon sat her down and gave her a classic ""It\'s Okay To Have Fun But Don\'t Ever Take It Too Far"" lecture. Indeed, Shannon claims that if Brandon had lived to see her wedding day, he would have walked her down the aisle.      He was originally cast as Johnny Cage in Mortal Kombat (1995), but died before production began.      He was offered the chance to play his dad in Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story (1993). Understandably, he turned it down so he could star in The Crow (1994). The film was later dedicated to his memory.      Was trained in Wing Chun, Shaolin Kung-Fu, Muay Thai & Jeet Kune Do.      The manner of his death is as follows: Michael Massee, the actor portraying Funboy, was required to fire a .44 magnum revolver loaded with blanks at Lee. The revolver had been inspected days earlier for a previously filmed scene in which it was not fired but needed to be seen loaded. Dummy rounds are used for this, which have a bullet, a spent primer, but no powder. One of the dummy rounds had a bullet, a live primer, and no powder. When test-fired, the primer propelled the bullet into the barrel, where it stopped. The gun was then rechecked, but no anomalies were found because the primer was now spent and the barrel was not inspected. Then, when filming the fateful scene days later, the same gun was used with blanks. Blanks are fully charged rounds with no bullets, but there was a bullet in the barrel. The blank round propelled it into Lee\'s abdomen just as if he had been shot with a live .44 magnum round. Michael Massee spent a year, devastated by what happened, deciding whether or not to return to acting.      Brandon Lee was killed by a wad from a blank pistol. In a scene from Bruce Lee\'s 1978 film, ""Game of Death,"" a prop man handling out blanks to some actors says,""These are blanks....There\'s a wad of paper that comes out and can injure someone."".Personal Quotes (16)      I don\'t want to be remembered as the son of Bruce Lee.      I always had a pretty good knack for raising hell.      Because we do not know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. And yet everything happens only a certain number of times, and a very small number really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, an afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you cannot conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four, or five times more? Perhaps not even that. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless.      [About The Crow (1994)] ""It\'s a story about justice for victims"".      [About The Crow (1994)] ""I\'ve done other films with violence in them, but I must say I\'ve never done anything where I felt the violence was as justified as it is in this...This is justice"".      I\'ve done my work and I\'m happy with it...I respect my father very much, but I\'m a very different person than he was.      ""I don\'t know if I was destined to play this role, but I feel very fortunate to be doing so."" (on his last film, The Crow (1994)).      ""The trip reinforced my suspicions that, despite my Pacific Rim heritage, I\'m about as American as you get."" (explaining that he feels no particular affinity for Asia and does not want to live there)      ""It\'s either in the genes, or I watched too many of his movies as a kid"" (on why his film roles echo those of his dad)      ""It\'s such an intensely personal thing for me.. I\'d probably have been a little too crazy"" (On why he refused the role in Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story (1993)).      A fight can express things people might not be able to say with words.      ""It\'s funny, [...] for that sequence the director just said, say something insulting to him, it doesn\'t matter what. So I said something pretty insulting, and they didn\'t subtitle it, and they never asked me what it meant. [..] (Laughter)"" (on the insult he says in Cantonese in Rapid Fire (1992))      You only have the burdens on you that you choose to put there.      All I can tell you is that you cannot make choices in your own career, either career choices or choices when you\'re actually working as an actor, based on trying to downplay or live up to a comparison with somebody else. You just can\'t do that. You have to do your own work based on your own gut, your own instincts, and your own life.      [About Eric Draven] He has something he has to do and he is forced to put aside his own pain long enough to go do what he has to do.""      [on why moving on after grief is important to realize your own dreams and purpose] Sometimes a personal tragedy provides the impetus we need to move on in life. It\'s easy to become stuck. We get lazy and we don\'t want to change. Change can be such a hassle. That\'s not to say that everyone requires a tragedy in their lives in order to get their ass moving, to take some kind of action or make some kind of decision: but if it happens, it can be definitely open your eyes. It can make you look at life differently, it can change your whole world, \'Why did this have to happen? What have I done? Why couldn\'t it have been somebody else?\' Sometimes it can make you a better person, Or a different person.Salary (4)Long zai jiang hu\xa0(1986)      $200,000       Showdown in Little Tokyo\xa0(1991)      $250,000       Rapid Fire\xa0(1992)      $270,000       The Crow\xa0(1994)      $750,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nPowers Boothe ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 27 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(3)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(13)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(5)  Overview (4)Date of Birth1\xa0June1948,\xa0Snyder, Texas, USA Date of Death14\xa0May2017,\xa0Los Angeles, California, USA      \xa0(pancreatic cancer-related cardiopulmonary arrest)    Birth NamePowers Allen BootheHeight6\'\xa02""\xa0(1.88\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Incisive, gravelly-voiced screen tough guy Powers Boothe was born on June 1, 1948 in Snyder, Texas, a sharecropper\'s son. Used to hard physical work ""chopping cotton"" as a youngster, he went on to become the first member of his family to attend university. He then proceeded to study acting via a fellowship with Southern Methodist University, earning a degree in Fine Arts. His performing career began in repertory with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. In 1974, Boothe arrived in New York after theatrical stints in Connecticut and Philadelphia. It took another five years before he made his breakthrough on Broadway as a swaggering Texas cowboy in James McLure\'s comedy play ""Lone Star"". His Emmy-winning performance as Reverend Jim Jones in the miniseries Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones (1980) led to a permanent move to Los Angeles. Lucrative screen offers followed and Boothe became firmly established as a leading actor after being well cast as Raymond Chandler\'s hard-boiled Philip Marlowe, Private Eye (1983), HBO\'s first drama series, set in 1930s Los Angeles.Though his portfolio of characters would eventually comprise assorted sheriffs, military brass and FBI agents, Boothe appreciated the indisputable fact that bad guys were often the ""last in people\'s minds"" and playing them could be ""more fun"". Arguably, his most convincing (and oddly likeable) villain was snarling gunslinger Curly Bill Brocius, confronting the Earps in Tombstone (1993). Boothe would go on to tackle with equal verve such complex characters as White House Chief of Staff Alexander Haig in Oliver Stone\'s Nixon (1995), hawkish Vice President Noah Daniels on 24 (2001) and industrialist power broker Lamar Wyatt in Nashville (2012). One of his best remembered roles remains that of Cy Tolliver, the (fictional) owner of the (historical) Bella Union saloon and brothel, chief nemesis of Al Swearingen on HBO\'s Deadwood (2004). Boothe particularly enjoyed his lengthy soliloquies which reminded him of his time on the Shakespearean stage. The tall Texan with the penetrating eyes was rather gleefully (and enjoyably) over-the-top fiendish as Senator Roark in the post film noir Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014) and managed (at least near the end) to inject some humanity into the role of Gideon Malick, the sinister head of HYDRA, in Marvel\'s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013).As is so often the case with actors of the \'hard-boiled school\', Boothe has often been described as the very antithesis of the characters he essayed on screen. Sin City director Robert Rodriguez fittingly eulogised him as ""a towering Texas gentleman and world class artist"". Powers Boothe died in his sleep at age 68 on the morning of May 14, 2017.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       I.S.Mowis          Spouse (1) Pam Cole (25 May\xa01969            - 14 May\xa02017)\xa0(his death)\xa0(2 children)          Trade Mark (3)        Frequently played authority figures, military or government agents or clergy        Piercing dark eyes and long face        Deep gravelly voiceTrivia (13)      He was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity at Southwest Texas State University.      In September 1980, in an act of defiance, he showed up at the Emmy Awards ceremony to collect the award he had won for playing Jim Jones. The Screen Actors Guild was in the middle of a strike and members boycotted the ceremony until the strike was settled. He was the only winner in an acting category who showed up. The incident was referenced in the James L. Brooks comedy film I\'ll Do Anything (1994).      Had two children: Parisse Boothe and Preston Boothe.      During the 1980 actor\'s boycott, he was one of the few nominees to attend the Emmy Awards ceremony, and the only winner to accept his award in person.      Was the youngest of three sons of Merrill Vestal Boothe and Emily Kathryn Reeves.      His family lived in the American South for many generations, and are generally of British Isles (English) ancestry.      For his role on Tombstone (1993), he was trained by renowned Hollywood Gun Coach Thell Reed, who has also trained such actors as: Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Bill Paxton, Sam Elliot, Michael Biehn, Brad Pitt, Girard Swan and Leonardo DiCaprio.      He was named after a friend of his father\'s that was killed in World War II.      Received his Master\'s degree in Fine Arts from Southern Methodist University and went on to become a resident actor at the Oregon Shakespeare Company.      He was inducted into the Texas Film Hall of Fame in Austin, Texas. [March 2009]      His favorite role was in the science fiction horror film Mutant Species (1994).

I also believe in my fellow actors in their stand.      Hell, I\'ve played as many guys who get the girl as I have heavies. I\'ve done love scenes with Jessica Lange [Blue Sky (1994)] and Jennifer Lopez [U Turn (1997)], and I won\'t kid you, they\'re fun.      I\'ve been fortunate in my career to have the opportunity to pick and choose the parts I play.

During his over four decade career, films claimed him as the Antichrist (Franco Macalousso) in the Apocalypse trilogy produced by Cloud Ten Pictures (Revelation (1999), Tribulation (2000) and Judgment (2001)), and TV has him best known for his starring roles in the NBC action series Stingray (1985), which ran for two seasons, and as the title hitman who becomes a target himself in the one-season Matrix (1993).Although he developed an interest in acting in high school, he chose to study psychology at the University of Toronto. The acting bug bit again, however, and he was soon drawn to various Canadian theatre groups in the 1970s. During this time, he became artistic director for the Vancouver Playhouse Theatre, at the same time building up his classical resume at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival.TV and film soon came his way in the late 1970s, and he tackled roles both in Hollywood, first as TV\'s Dr. Scorpion (1978), and back in his homeland, where he won the prestigious Genie award for the movie Ticket to Heaven (1981) as a man caught up in a religious cult. He impressed moviegoers as well with his moody, sexy presence in the US film Heartbreakers (1984) co-starring Peter Coyote and has also provided solid support for other stars, notably for Steven Seagal in one of that star\'s best action thrillers Under Siege (1992).A sturdy name as an anti-hero or heavy in modestly-budgeted independents, Nick has proven over the years to be a solid, durable player in the ""tough guy"" crime mold, almost always with a serious edge. More recent, post-millennium gritty films include Time of Fear (2002) Today You Die (2005), starring his ""Under Siege"" cohort Steven Seagal, Contract Killers (2008), Violent Blue (2011), Hostage (2013) and The Big Fat Stone (2014).- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net          Spouse (3) Nadia Capone (1998            - 2006)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)           Barbara Williams (May 1987            - ?)\xa0(divorced)           Patricia Pelham (24 May\xa01981            - 1983)\xa0(divorced)          Trade Mark (1)        Raspy voice.Trivia (3)      Moved to Canada in 1956.

I\'m not going to live forever and if I am I certainly need don\'t you to tell me that so that I will buy a car or a box of dried up crackers.      Sex is the great equalizer.

He declined several times before giving in.Personal Quotes (5)      I did things because of the things themselves. And I still do that with my writing, my painting, sometimes with acting still, and I don\'t care. You\'re at the mercy of money. You become nothing more than a hunter, in terms of tribal ethic, because we all are members of a tribe, let\'s face it. You go through your war period in high school when you\'re a little jock, then you become a provider for your family. Some people are better hunters than other, and bring in more deer. In our culture it\'s not about deer, it\'s about money, which is tragic. I think if you lose touch with that stuff, with what you really care about, you\'re dead in the water.      Being an artist, particularly being an actor, is a very worthwhile life, but can also be a very hard one, because you can\'t hide. Specifically, what you can\'t hide from are your tensions, which are derived from fear. It reads on a screen or on stage if you\'re tense, and the tension has got to come from some hang-up you have about being there to begin with.      I respect painting and writing, in many ways, more than I respect acting now that I know how to do it. In the beginning, when I couldn\'t act my way out of a paper bag, maybe I respected acting more than anything else because I couldn\'t do it.      Actors are very macho-oriented. In my own case, I don\'t give a shit. I\'d love to play a gay character. I\'d love to play a [transgender man]. Nothing would please me more. My heart is like in the yin-yang space, as opposed to walking around set flexing my muscles or whatever.

This was Brandon Lee's second american made movie (Showdown In Little Tokyo
was the first) and the film where you could see Brandon was starting his
ascent up the action hero ladder. With each film Brandon's martial arts
skills improved and in this movie he really shines. Not to mention his
acting ability as well. 
He proved in this movie that he had what it takes to be a star. He
incorporated some Hong Kong style action similar to Jackie Chan's films into
this movie. An example is a terrific sequence in a small apartment where Lee
takes on several bad guys armed with guns and he takes them out with his
hands, feet, kitchen utensils, refrigerator doors, etc. Powers Boothe also
does a great job as tired cop and Nick Mancuso plays the main villain very

him are, in fact, on Serrano's payroll. Jake has no choice but to team
up with Chicago cop Mace Ryan (Powers Boothe) and kick some gangster
arse. Awesome.<br><br>Right from the start, 'Rapid Fire' is pretty much a showcase for
Brandon Lee's martial-arts abilities. He was awesome on-screen in this,
as in his other movies, and could pull off some really cool action
scenes. Apparently Brandon was a fan of Jackie Chan, and it shows in
this: Brandon uses easily recognizable stunts and fights from 'Police

did originally.<br><br>You won't find any semblance of a plot in this. 'Rapid Fire' is an
action movie, the only difference between this and any other action
movie is that Brandon played a college student instead of any usual
action hero type. Naturally, this college student also knows how to
kick butt, so there goes any developed plot, in favour of Brandon Lee
kicking arse. Awesome.<br><br>Simply, 'Rapid Fire' is an awesome action movie. Brandon Lee rocked,
may he rest in peace - 9/10

We'll never know what Brandon Lee, who was the son of the late martial arts
legend Bruce Lee, would be capable of in Hollywood since he, like his
father, died before the peek of his fame, and subsequently a mass following
has been built in his memory.<br><br>Bruce Lee died just weeks before the American premiere of his last completed
film ""Enter the Dragon"" in 1973.  Consequently, Lee had also been working on
the ""Game of Death"" before his passing, which we would later see,
meticulously reconstructed (as Lee had intended), in John Little's touching
and poignant documentary ""Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey.""<br><br>Brandon was slain by a stunt gun while filming a scene in his last movie,
1994's ""The Crow.""  Using careful CGI techniques, the filmmakers were able
to successfully gather enough footage of Lee's performance to complete the
film.  Lee haunted every frame of Alex Proyas' dark and deeply affecting
film, which was the adaptation of James O'Barr's popular comic book
character.<br><br>Brandon, like his father, was also a talented performer - actor and martial
artist.  However, if one were looking for Brandon's acting talents, look at
""The Crow,"" as you will not see much of him using martial arts.  If one were
looking to see him using those martial arts talents, and the best showcase
for those talents, look no further than 1992's ""Rapid Fire.""<br><br>""Rapid Fire,"" from the beginning, has a very flimsy plot, as Lee plays a
Chicago art student who witnesses the gangland murder of a South Asian drug
lord by Italian mobsters.  Lee can't trust anyone, as he's forced to go on
the run from gangsters (Asian and Italian), cops, and other corrupt law
enforcement officials.  It seems that he can only find comfort and
protection through his martial arts skills and an independent Chicago police
unit headed by a grizzled cop (Powers Boothe).<br><br>As stated before, you should only watch ""Rapid Fire"" for Brandon Lee's
martial arts skills, as this is really the best place to see them; you're
not going to find them in ""The Crow.""  Brandon did the best that he could
with this role and just went with it.<br><br>Brandon, like his father, passed on before true success would reign in on
him.  Like Bruce and ""Enter the Dragon,"" Brandon and his last film ""The
Crow,"" will be forever remembered by fans and cinema-goers alike in years to
come.<br><br>I'm not really sure where ""Rapid Fire"" would stand in Brandon's short-lived
career, other than it was a showcase for his fighting talents.  ""Rapid Fire""
is decent, certainly not perfect, but very fun to watch
nonetheless.<br><br>7/10

Bruce's son gets the Hollywood B-movie treatment in this all-out action
fest
that stands as one of his better pictures, featuring a roguish yet
charming
Brandon fighting like his father in scenes that frankly appear out of
place
in an American action picture of its time. Thankfully, Brandon neglects
the
deadly stares and patriotic words of his father and offers us a totally
different image altogether: Brandon is hip-talking, cool, equipped with an
attractive physique and razor-sharp kung fu. He plays Jake Lo, a
bike-riding
Chinese-American who gets himself caught up in a plight to bring to
justice
a mighty drug trafficker after he witnesses him murder a client. Soon Jake
is enlisted to be used as bait in the police's attempts to root out the
drug
lord. Throw in a load of gunfights and fisticuffs and we have quite a
meaty
actioner on our hands, complete with Hong Kong-style choreography
supervised
by Brandon himself (the best example being a classy little battle with
midget-stuntman Al Leong). Rapid Fire did prove to be Brandon's big break,
and it's through his uniquely charismatic and exciting performance here
that
makes us acknowledge his early death with an even greater tinge of
sadness.

One of Brandon Lee's best films is Rapid Fire! Powers Boothe, Nick
Mancuso, Tony Longo, Tzi Ma, Kate Hodge, Al Leong also star! The action
is very good in this movie and in fact in My opinion its some of the
neatest fighting action in a movie! The music is by composer
Christopher Young which it is a very different score! The acting in the
film is solid. Brandon Lee did a lot in this film and his fights with
Tony Long and Al Leong were very good! I think that Lee had a potential
to be a huge star because this film proves it! If you like big time
action in a film with martial arts and are a fan of Bruce Lee, Chuck
Norris, Steven Seagal, Jean Claude Van-Damme, Bolo Yeung, Michel Qissi,
and Jet Li and want to see Brandon Lee and Powers Boothe in different
performances then Rapid Fire is a good one to watch!

I saw this once when I was about 10 years old and ever since that I have
been a huge Brandon Lee fan, and since the first time I watched it I have
seen this movie over and over again and I never seem to get bored of it.
Everything about this film is good, especially the seemingly non-stop
action
and Brandon Lee's amazing martial arts skills which he displays very well.
Another part of this movie is the incredible acting.....both from Brandon
Lee and the supporting actor Powers Boothe(Mace Ryans) . This is one of
those films that stick out and it's one of those films which you can just
watch over and over again and never get bored of. When you see a normal
action film you notice that the acting and the plot are rather weak however
in Rapid Fire everything is strong and enjoyable....the plot, the acting
and
of course the action. Many people have said that Rapid Fire is slightly
tacky and corny, well all I can say is what do you expect from an action
movie made in 1992?<br><br>This is an amazing film which really sticks out and leaves a mark, and
Brandon Lee is excellent and not to mention funny and his sarcasm and
strange sense of humor is a fresh change from the usual wooden and hollow
action heroes. This is one of my favorite movies of all time and if you're
a
Brandon Lee fan such as myself this is truly unmissable.<br><br>9 out of 10

It was a huge blow when the news of Brandon Lee's death made headlines
in the mid 1990s. The fact that the guy never managed to fulfil his
opportunities as a successful action movie star and follow in the
footsteps of his dad in that particular sense was tragic, considering
just how good he was on screen. Showdown In Little Tokyo was a C-list
martial arts epic, whilst The Crow- Brandon's very last movie he had
starred in, was a horror movie, which whilst his martial arts skills
were relatively limited, he still manage to display his acting graft as
well as to show that he can act, in addition to kicking arse.<br><br>Rapid Fire came out in 1992 amidst his previous effort, his
collaboration with Dolph Lundgren entitled: 'Showdown in Little Tokyo',
which was released the year before. In this movie, Brandon plays art
student Jake Lo, who witnesses a murder and afterwards, finds himself
on the run from a gang of evil drug lords, as well as a bunch of
two-faced, backstabbing cops, of whom are enlisted and supposed to
protect Jake but who turn out to be doing the dirty work for the bad
guys. Thankfully, he has a good cop on his side and together, the pair,
despite their dislike for one another, work together to bring them to
justice.<br><br>American martial arts films tend to be rather forgettable, run-of-the
mill type of movies compared to the Hong Kong, Kung Fu-based flicks,
but Rapid Fire in contrast is one of the much better efforts. It is
action-packed, explosive and Brandon is not that bad of a fighter. He
is exceedingly good and manages to combine his late father's trademark
moves and aggression with Jackie Chan's athleticism, and his fast and
frenetic movements. Another leaf he has taken out of his text book is
when he takes an object and smashes it on his opponents head, for
example.<br><br>This is a good martial arts movie; alas, it is a glimpse of how great
Brandon was and how great could have been and how far his career might
have gone- had he still been alive today

Brandon Lee is nothing short of electric in this movie and I suspect that
had he lived he would have alternated movies like this with more esoteric
fare like ""THE CROW."" He had the potential to be a bigger star than his
father as he was a better actor and was more vulnerable in his portrayal
of
a fighting hero therefore making him appeal to both sexes.Women tend not
to
be great Bruce Lee fans.
The action in this movie is explosive and well choreographed and for this
credit should go to Lee's friend Jeff Imada whose name you will find on
the
credits of most movies and t.v.shows that feature martial arts
action.Powers
Boothe is his usual reliable self in his cop role and if faults are to be
found with ""RAPID FIRE"" they are that the villains are not memorable nor
do
they offer a great threat to Lee and the leading lady is just used as
window
dressing.However,Dwight Little as director delivers the goods here and the
film is an good companion piece to his exhilarating Steven Seagal actioner
""MARKED FOR DEATH."" made the previous year.

'Rapid Fire' goes down as one of my favourite Brandon Lee movies,
joining 'Showdown in Little Tokyo', 'Laser Mission', and 'The Crow'. Oh
wait. Yeah, I'm just a Brandon Lee fan boy. Brandon was awesome. 'Rapid
Fire' is awesome.<br><br>Brandon plays Jake Lo, a college student majoring in arse-kicking. Jake
witnesses the murder of a drug-lord by mafia boss Antonio Serrano (Nick
Mancuso). Jake is put under the Witness Protection Program for a whole
of five minutes before discovering that the agents supposed to protect
him are, in fact, on Serrano's payroll. Jake has no choice but to team
up with Chicago cop Mace Ryan (Powers Boothe) and kick some gangster
arse. Awesome.<br><br>Right from the start, 'Rapid Fire' is pretty much a showcase for
Brandon Lee's martial-arts abilities. He was awesome on-screen in this,
as in his other movies, and could pull off some really cool action
scenes. Apparently Brandon was a fan of Jackie Chan, and it shows in
this: Brandon uses easily recognizable stunts and fights from 'Police
Story' (among other movies) and does them just as well as Jackie Chan
did originally.<br><br>You won't find any semblance of a plot in this. 'Rapid Fire' is an
action movie, the only difference between this and any other action
movie is that Brandon played a college student instead of any usual
action hero type. Naturally, this college student also knows how to
kick butt, so there goes any developed plot, in favour of Brandon Lee
kicking arse. Awesome.<br><br>Simply, 'Rapid Fire' is an awesome action movie. Brandon Lee rocked,
may he rest in peace - 9/10

We'll never know what Brandon Lee, who was the son of the late martial arts
legend Bruce Lee, would be capable of in Hollywood since he, like his
father, died before the peek of his fame, and subsequently a mass following
has been built in his memory.<br><br>Bruce Lee died just weeks before the American premiere of his last completed
film ""Enter the Dragon"" in 1973.  Consequently, Lee had also been working on
the ""Game of Death"" before his passing, which we would later see,
meticulously reconstructed (as Lee had intended), in John Little's touching
and poignant documentary ""Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey.""<br><br>Brandon was slain by a stunt gun while filming a scene in his last movie,
1994's ""The Crow.""  Using careful CGI techniques, the filmmakers were able
to successfully gather enough footage of Lee's performance to complete the
film.  Lee haunted every frame of Alex Proyas' dark and deeply affecting
film, which was the adaptation of James O'Barr's popular comic book
character.<br><br>Brandon, like his father, was also a talented performer - actor and martial
artist.  However, if one were looking for Brandon's acting talents, look at
""The Crow,"" as you will not see much of him using martial arts.  If one were
looking to see him using those martial arts talents, and the best showcase
for those talents, look no further than 1992's ""Rapid Fire.""<br><br>""Rapid Fire,"" from the beginning, has a very flimsy plot, as Lee plays a
Chicago art student who witnesses the gangland murder of a South Asian drug
lord by Italian mobsters.  Lee can't trust anyone, as he's forced to go on
the run from gangsters (Asian and Italian), cops, and other corrupt law
enforcement officials.  It seems that he can only find comfort and
protection through his martial arts skills and an independent Chicago police
unit headed by a grizzled cop (Powers Boothe).<br><br>As stated before, you should only watch ""Rapid Fire"" for Brandon Lee's
martial arts skills, as this is really the best place to see them; you're
not going to find them in ""The Crow.""  Brandon did the best that he could
with this role and just went with it.<br><br>Brandon, like his father, passed on before true success would reign in on
him.  Like Bruce and ""Enter the Dragon,"" Brandon and his last film ""The
Crow,"" will be forever remembered by fans and cinema-goers alike in years to
come.<br><br>I'm not really sure where ""Rapid Fire"" would stand in Brandon's short-lived
career, other than it was a showcase for his fighting talents.  ""Rapid Fire""
is decent, certainly not perfect, but very fun to watch
nonetheless.<br><br>7/10

Bruce's son gets the Hollywood B-movie treatment in this all-out action
fest
that stands as one of his better pictures, featuring a roguish yet
charming
Brandon fighting like his father in scenes that frankly appear out of
place
in an American action picture of its time. Thankfully, Brandon neglects
the
deadly stares and patriotic words of his father and offers us a totally
different image altogether: Brandon is hip-talking, cool, equipped with an
attractive physique and razor-sharp kung fu. He plays Jake Lo, a
bike-riding
Chinese-American who gets himself caught up in a plight to bring to
justice
a mighty drug trafficker after he witnesses him murder a client. Soon Jake
is enlisted to be used as bait in the police's attempts to root out the
drug
lord. Throw in a load of gunfights and fisticuffs and we have quite a
meaty
actioner on our hands, complete with Hong Kong-style choreography
supervised
by Brandon himself (the best example being a classy little battle with
midget-stuntman Al Leong). Rapid Fire did prove to be Brandon's big break,
and it's through his uniquely charismatic and exciting performance here
that
makes us acknowledge his early death with an even greater tinge of
sadness.

One of Brandon Lee's best films is Rapid Fire! Powers Boothe, Nick
Mancuso, Tony Longo, Tzi Ma, Kate Hodge, Al Leong also star! The action
is very good in this movie and in fact in My opinion its some of the
neatest fighting action in a movie! The music is by composer
Christopher Young which it is a very different score! The acting in the
film is solid. Brandon Lee did a lot in this film and his fights with
Tony Long and Al Leong were very good! I think that Lee had a potential
to be a huge star because this film proves it! If you like big time
action in a film with martial arts and are a fan of Bruce Lee, Chuck
Norris, Steven Seagal, Jean Claude Van-Damme, Bolo Yeung, Michel Qissi,
and Jet Li and want to see Brandon Lee and Powers Boothe in different
performances then Rapid Fire is a good one to watch!

I saw this once when I was about 10 years old and ever since that I have
been a huge Brandon Lee fan, and since the first time I watched it I have
seen this movie over and over again and I never seem to get bored of it.
Everything about this film is good, especially the seemingly non-stop
action
and Brandon Lee's amazing martial arts skills which he displays very well.
Another part of this movie is the incredible acting.....both from Brandon
Lee and the supporting actor Powers Boothe(Mace Ryans) . This is one of
those films that stick out and it's one of those films which you can just
watch over and over again and never get bored of. When you see a normal
action film you notice that the acting and the plot are rather weak however
in Rapid Fire everything is strong and enjoyable....the plot, the acting
and
of course the action. Many people have said that Rapid Fire is slightly
tacky and corny, well all I can say is what do you expect from an action
movie made in 1992?<br><br>This is an amazing film which really sticks out and leaves a mark, and
Brandon Lee is excellent and not to mention funny and his sarcasm and
strange sense of humor is a fresh change from the usual wooden and hollow
action heroes. This is one of my favorite movies of all time and if you're
a
Brandon Lee fan such as myself this is truly unmissable.<br><br>9 out of 10

It was a huge blow when the news of Brandon Lee's death made headlines
in the mid 1990s. The fact that the guy never managed to fulfil his
opportunities as a successful action movie star and follow in the
footsteps of his dad in that particular sense was tragic, considering
just how good he was on screen. Showdown In Little Tokyo was a C-list
martial arts epic, whilst The Crow- Brandon's very last movie he had
starred in, was a horror movie, which whilst his martial arts skills
were relatively limited, he still manage to display his acting graft as
well as to show that he can act, in addition to kicking arse.<br><br>Rapid Fire came out in 1992 amidst his previous effort, his
collaboration with Dolph Lundgren entitled: 'Showdown in Little Tokyo',
which was released the year before. In this movie, Brandon plays art
student Jake Lo, who witnesses a murder and afterwards, finds himself
on the run from a gang of evil drug lords, as well as a bunch of
two-faced, backstabbing cops, of whom are enlisted and supposed to
protect Jake but who turn out to be doing the dirty work for the bad
guys. Thankfully, he has a good cop on his side and together, the pair,
despite their dislike for one another, work together to bring them to
justice.<br><br>American martial arts films tend to be rather forgettable, run-of-the
mill type of movies compared to the Hong Kong, Kung Fu-based flicks,
but Rapid Fire in contrast is one of the much better efforts. It is
action-packed, explosive and Brandon is not that bad of a fighter. He
is exceedingly good and manages to combine his late father's trademark
moves and aggression with Jackie Chan's athleticism, and his fast and
frenetic movements. Another leaf he has taken out of his text book is
when he takes an object and smashes it on his opponents head, for
example.<br><br>This is a good martial arts movie; alas, it is a glimpse of how great
Brandon was and how great could have been and how far his career might
have gone- had he still been alive today

Brandon Lee is nothing short of electric in this movie and I suspect that
had he lived he would have alternated movies like this with more esoteric
fare like ""THE CROW."" He had the potential to be a bigger star than his
father as he was a better actor and was more vulnerable in his portrayal
of
a fighting hero therefore making him appeal to both sexes.Women tend not
to
be great Bruce Lee fans.
The action in this movie is explosive and well choreographed and for this
credit should go to Lee's friend Jeff Imada whose name you will find on
the
credits of most movies and t.v.shows that feature martial arts
action.Powers
Boothe is his usual reliable self in his cop role and if faults are to be
found with ""RAPID FIRE"" they are that the villains are not memorable nor
do
they offer a great threat to Lee and the leading lady is just used as
window
dressing.However,Dwight Little as director delivers the goods here and the
film is an good companion piece to his exhilarating Steven Seagal actioner
""MARKED FOR DEATH."" made the previous year.

His paternal grandfather, George Henry Dern, served as Governor of Utah (1925-1933) and then U.S. Secretary of War (1933-1936). His ancestry includes German, English, Scottish, and Dutch.Bruce Dern had established himself as the movies\' premier heavy, playing sociopaths, psychotics and just plain criminals by the time he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Coming Home (1978). Some perceptive critics had noted that Dern was a finer actor than his roles generally allowed one to believe, repelled as one was by the neurotic persona that Dern was able to project and that casting directors capitalized on.Jack Nicholson, a close friend, claimed that Dern was the best of the new breed of actors who had been born just before World War II and were coming into their own in the 1970s. Unlike his screen image, Dern had come from a patrician background: his grandfather had been governor of Utah and a secretary of war under Franklin D. Roosevelt. When allowed to step out of his on-screen persona to assay the millionaire Tom Buchanan in the 1974 remake of The Great Gatsby (1974), he acquitted himself quite well.Some critics said that ""Gatsby"" would have been better if Dern rather than Robert Redford had played the title role. Others pointed to his fine work as Nicholson\'s brother in The King of Marvin Gardens (1972) to establish a case that he was an underappreciated and underutilized talent. By the time Dern appeared as the cuckolded Marine in ""Coming Home,"" a consensus had emerged that Dern was a fine actor. He won an Oscar nod for the role, then fell victim to the infamous ""Oscar curse"" that has claimed other winners, most famously in the case of 1969 Best Supporting Actor winner Gig Young, Dern\'s co-star in They Shoot Horses, Don\'t They? (1969).Dern, like Young before him, was determined to break out of supporting roles. Like Young, who had been cast repeatedly as a light comedian in his career, Dern had also become typecast, but as a psycho, surpassing even Anthony Perkins in those types of roles. Dern was determined to break out of the ghetto he had found himself in before ""Coming Home."" He failed, and his career suffered.Up through his Oscar nomination, Dern had starred in 26 films in 11 years since graduating to steady employment in A-pictures with Waterhole #3 (1967). After the 1979 Oscar nod, he would appear in only a dozen feature films in the next 11 years, not counting TV movies. None of them brought him stardom or much acclaim, and his attempt at becoming a lead man, Middle Age Crazy (1980), flopped badly (he did received a nomination for Best Performance by a Foreign Actor at the 1981 Genie Awards, the Canadian equivalent of the Oscars, for his work in that picture). It was back to psychos, this time as a lead, in Tattoo (1981). The movie proved to be another flop, and his reputation was further damaged when he bragged that he had actually performed on-screen sexual intercourse with co-star Maud Adams, a boast that Adams heatedly denied. Dern\'s star was seriously dimmed.Although he landed a coveted role in the film adaptation of Jason Miller\'s Pulitzer Prize-winning play That Championship Season (1982), the film was a disappointment with critics and at the box office. He turned in a fine performance three years later in the TV movie Toughlove (1985), but overall, his career was floundering.Another psycho role, that of Uncle Bud in After Dark, My Sweet (1990), started buzz about another possible Best Supporting Oscar nod for him, but the film proved a box-office bust and the nomination never materialized. A predicted career renaissance for Dern faded, just as the careers of his ex-wife, Diane Ladd, and their daughter, Laura Dern, kicked into high gear.Since the 1990 high point of the second wave of his career, Dern has stayed steadily employed, but has never again generated much critical acclaim, nor made any inroads towards reclaiming his crown as the cinema\'s premier sociopath. A fine actor, who will be remembered most vividly for such psycho/killer roles such as the rustler leader who gunned down John Wayne in The Cowboys (1972), Dern\'s career serves as a cautionary tale for those actors who try to escape the ghetto of typecasting. While nothing restricts an actor\'s artistic development as much as typecasting, unless like a Duke Wayne they can turn that type into superstardom, trying to break out of the type can prove to be career suicide.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Jon C.

Born at 3:11am-CDT      Is one of the few actors to have killed John Wayne on screen (The Cowboys (1972)). He even received some death threats out of that.      Had two daughters with Diane Ladd. His eldest daughter, Diane Dern, was born November 27, 1960, and accidentally drowned in California on May 18, 1962 at just shy of 18 months of age, years before his second child, Laura Dern, was born in 1967.

He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6270 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on November 1, 2010.      Seventeen years after daughter Laura Dern starred in Alexander Payne\'s first major film Citizen Ruth (1996), Bruce starred in Payne\'s Nebraska (2013) -- probably one of the few, if only, times in movie history that a father-daughter duo similarly starred in the same director\'s films, especially with the actress/daughter\'s performance preceding her actor/father\'s.      Became a father for the first time at age 25 when his second [now ex] wife Diane Ladd gave birth to their daughter Diane Elizabeth Dern in 1961.      Became a father for the second time at age 30 when his second [now ex] wife Diane Ladd gave birth to their daughter Laura Elizabeth Dern, aka Laura Dern on February 10, 1967.      Became a grandfather for the first time at age 65 when his daughter Laura Dern gave birth to her son Ellery Walker Harper, with [now ex] husband Ben Harper, on August 10, 2001.      Became a grandfather for the second time at age 68 when his daughter Laura Dern gave birth to her daughter Jaya Harper, with [now ex] husband Ben Harper, on November 28, 2004.      Claims that he has never smoked outside of the movies, or drank alcohol or coffee, due to his commitment to marathon running.

Is a supporter of the Chelsea Football Club.      Was shot and killed in his first western appearance,an episode of \'Wagon Train\' in 1963 and was shot and killed in what is probably his last western \'The Hateful Eight\' 52 years later which must be a record.Personal Quotes (26)      Because I\'m the only actor who ever killed John Wayne in a picture, producers have pegged me for a villain.      I\'ve played more psychotics and freaks and dopers than anyone.      [on his fight scene with John Wayne] He walloped me bad.      I never look back and say, ""I wish I had played that role or this role"". I never do that. You\'re only as good as your next film. I look forward; I always feel that you have to continue onward and upward, you can\'t look back. I became an actor because I felt I was interested in what makes human beings do what they do, particularly in times of crisis. That kind of acting is what I like to do.      I\'m only too proud to say that I\'ve never had ANY discipline problems with Laura [Laura Dern, his daughter]. In fact, I never needed to lay a hand on her, because Diane [Diane Ladd, his former wife and Laura\'s mother] was so much better at keeping her in line than I was.      [on James Dean] Dean was so real. I believed he was the real person, that he wasn\'t acting. See, I never thought Rock Hudson was real. Or any of the guys in the forefront then -- Gregory Peck, Paul Newman and them.      [on Peter Fonda] In The Trip (1967) I started to get fed up. I was fed up because Peter Fonda was a star and I wasn\'t. And Peter couldn\'t act. I\'m sorry, man, he just can\'t act. He never bothered to sit and learn. He never studied. And he just kind of larked out. Now I don\'t begrudge the fact that he has talent. But he\'s not an actor, by any stretch of the imagination.      [on Charlton Heston] And I got to really like the guy. A lot of people told me that I wouldn\'t like him, but I liked him. And he tried very hard. I mean, Will Penny (1967) is far and away the best thing he\'s ever done.      I haven\'t had many love affairs on-screen. In The Great Gatsby (1974), I had one with Karen Black. Then I broke her nose.      [on The Incredible 2-Headed Transplant (1971)] I look on it as a fond memory. It brought me together with my wife. The film was a nightmare to make, but I got married with the money I made from that movie: $1750.      That\'s a part of my personality that has not been seen before in a movie. If there\'s anything Bruce hasn\'t been in his career, it\'s still. I didn\'t want to be Bruce. I\'d been Bruce, and it didn\'t work.      The roles I got were the ones 15 guys turned down. Seventeen people turned down Silent Running (1972)... I got panicky financially, spiritually. I got to feeling maybe people weren\'t seeing the work that I could do, either because the movies weren\'t good, or maybe I wasn\'t good in the movies.      [2013, observation on his career] I knew it would be longer than a marathon. I was in a hurry only to get the opportunities that my peers were getting. That never came along until Nebraska (2013). I\'m going to one-hundred. I\'m going to play roles people will never forget.      [on the possibility of being pushed for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance in Nebraska (2013)] My take is this: the story is about who Woody is and where he\'s going. It\'s probably 50-50 screen time with Will Forte, but Woody is a leading role. If I go supporting, I\'m a whore. Because I never came to Hollywood to win an award. I came to do good movies. If I go supporting, it\'s embarrassing to the Academy because it looks like I\'m trying to sneak in somehow so I can eat all those chicken and peas dinners. I\'d rather go the right way than backdoor my way into a supporting because of my age or whatever. I would be thrilled if I was nominated, and to have a nomination is the win.      [on Elia Kazan] Kazan, I don\'t care what his politics were - the man had game. He knew how to see a movie before it began.      [on Alexander Payne] I may put Alexander as the best director I ever worked with. When he looks through the eyepiece of a camera, he sees something no one else sees. He sees magic. And his gift is, he can explain how and why he sees magic and put it on film.      [on meeting Marilyn Monroe at the Actors Studio] She leaned over to me and, I\'d never met her - she\'s Marilyn Monroe, I\'m Brucy from Winnetka - and she said, ""Oh, you\'re Gadge\'s new wunderkind, aren\'t you?"" And I said, ""Oh, come on please. He doesn\'t say that."" She said, \'Yes, he does. He also says nobody\'s going to know who you are until you\'re in your late 60s."".      [on Lawrence of Arabia (1962)] I saw David Lean\'s Lawrence of Arabia in 1962. I\'d been an actor for four years. All my life, I\'ve been fascinated by people that get shit done. T.E. Lawrence got stuff done. And the movie is just about perfect in every single category: lighting, camera, clothing, script, story, performances. There was an intermission, and it was worth the wait -- I couldn\'t wait until the second half. What shocked me was, the first thing they shot for the movie was the beginning of the second half, the arrival of Lawrence with his bodyguards. Those guys, who look like the baddest asses that ever lived, came in on horses and camels. Peter O\'Toole\'s got the white garb on, and you realize he\'s a guy who\'s got some homies that can play.      [on the influence of Lawrence of Arabia (1962)] If there\'s anything I\'m proud about in Nebraska (2013), it\'s that it\'s hard to see the work going on. In Lawrence, there\'s something going on -- it\'s there. It\'s about life. Watching that old generation like Lean and O\'Toole, that knowledge, that excitement, that passion infects you and infects you in a good way. You want to make \'em proud, even though they\'re not here anymore.      [on being offered a role in They Shoot Horses, Don\'t They? (1969)] It\'s the week before Christmas, 1968, and my agent calls: ""Bruce, you won\'t believe this. I got a call from Sydney Pollack."" I said, ""What are you talking about?"" He said, ""He\'s doing another movie, and he wants you in it. He says he apologizes because it\'s not much of a part. It\'s certainly not an improvement over the last part, but he offered you the Scott Wilson role and you didn\'t want to take it because you didn\'t want to be in Yugoslavia five months. ""Do you blame me?"" ""No, it ended up being seven. You were smart. He\'s doing a movie called ""They Shoot Horses, Don\'t They?"", and he said you and a girl named Bonnie Bedelia, who hasn\'t acted before, are going to be partners. It\'s about dance marathons, and he wants you for two reasons: one, you play a country bumpkin and you win the contest; two, he needs somebody who can show the actors what it\'s like to go take after take after take because Bonnie is pregnant in the movie and you\'ve got to haul her every day, derby after derby. Twice each day, they\'re raced twelve laps around the floor to music. The last three couples are eliminated. Sydney wants to shoot it like that. He\'s going to eliminate the couples except for the two starring couples, Jane Fonda and Michael Sarrazin, and Red Buttons and Allyn Ann McLerie. Everybody else gets eliminated, including Susannah York."" Susannah York should\'ve won an Oscar for The Killing of Sister George (1968). He\'s going to eliminate her?""

Recently someone asked me what was the best sci-fi movie I'd ever seen.
""Best""? On what basis -- story, acting, special effects? Generally one would
usually choose one of the high-tech, high-priced, superstar biggies.<br><br>But I had to say ""Silent Running."" Oh, it has special effects all right, and
I think they're good enough for the purpose; I certainly felt the cramped
dimness of the station against the vast implacability of space. Maybe you'd
say it doesn't have enough action, surprises, or gore. But maybe this story
doesn't need them.<br><br>Then why is it my nomination? Because when it was over, I had to turn off
the TV -- couldn't let its mood and memory be violated by a late-nite
commercial -- and just quietly weep for its poignancy. Anything less (or
more) would have denied it the respect it deserved.<br><br>If you must, watch it as just more fodder for your entertainment urge. But
if your soul is deeper than that... if you can, as Bruce Dern does, put
yourself in the place of a character who so cares about the earth and its
place in the cosmos ... you'll appreciate the eloquent statement of this
film and the way it's presented.<br><br>A man, not a god. But if it were you, if you were there... would you, COULD

I remember first seeing this film on television I think in 1973 and
being mesmerized by it.  Even though I found the the premise to be
absurd (more on that below), the story and movie triumphs
regardless.  This is flim making at its most brilliant.  With the
exception of Terrence Malick's ""Badlands,"" I cannot think of a finer
directorial debut.  It is one of the tragedies of contemporary
cinema, that Douglas Trumbull could not find any work as a
director for years afterwards.  What a loss!  The studio completely
blew it.<br><br>The movie.  Yes, the premise is incoherent and it has to be dealt
with.  Sometime in the early years of the next century what is left of
America's forests are gathered up and put on space freighters and
shipped to . . . Saturn.  Why is most unclear.  Putting the forest
domes in orbit around earth would have made perfect sense.
Moreover, the film goes to great lengths to show that the robots are
fully capable of tending to them alone so the whole bit about the
unhappy human crew is unnecessary.  But off to Saturn we go
(where the light for the plants -- surprise -- is really bad).<br><br>I understand that Trumbull was thinking of an alien contact story
initially -- I am certain to be going out on a limb on this one -- which
seemed to bear some resemblence to the Poul Anderson novella
""Southern Cross.""  The aliens were soon dumped, however.  What
remained turned out to be an utterly compelling psychological
drama of a man alone in space that is unlike any SF movie I have
seen (it does bear some similarity to a few Twilight Zone
episodes, however).<br><br>This is an astonishing technical achievement in movie making.
Everything about this film works: music, effects, photography, sets,
acting, editing, direction, you name it.  Folks, this was done for all
of one million dollars and is a hundred times more compelling
than films that cost a hundred times as much.  This is art.  This is
literature.  Get the DVD.  Just sit down an watch it.  This is a lovely,
timeless, piece of work.<br><br>Then weep because they don't make 'em like this anymore.  .

Sometime in the future all the forests on Earth have been
destroyed. The last forests are transported in giant greenhouses
aboard space ships near the planet Saturn. Freeman Lowell,
crew
member of the space vessel Valley Forge, is an outsider and
the
only one who cares about what is left of our planet's nature.
When
orders reach their vessel to destroy the forests, he goes mad.
He
kills off the other crew members and starts a lonely odyssey...<br><br>There's something to be learnt in this movie. More than 30
years
old now, it stands the test of time with its message, as mankind
is
still working on what possibly could end in a scenario like
this.
Bruce Dern may be overacting in some scenes, but his character
is still much more likeable than his crew comrades. Scenery
and
music are beautiful, fitting well to the dark, moving and
unique
story. And this is the movie that made ""Star Wars"" possible.
Director Douglas Trumbull and other SFX masters like John
Dykstra and Richard Yuricich were chosen to work on ""Star
Wars""
because of the state-of-the-arts special effects they did for
""Silent
Running"". In 1971, they were ahead of their time. In fact, they
are
easily as good as today's CGI effects, but much more memorable
for their time. Even the droids that help Lowell are predecessors
of
the ones in ""Star Wars""... A must-see movie for SF fans
and
everybody interested in Hollywood classics.

Maybe one of the most moving things about this film is the fact that
the drones (small droids) give such powerful performances without ever
being able to utter a word. Maybe a ""nod"" in some ways to the days of
the silent movie. The environmental message is as powerful today as it
was in 1972.<br><br>An extremely good yet brief film that I felt I had to comment upon it.
Enjoyed the hippy theme tune as well just because it fitted right in.
These types of film are rare but precious. I remember watching this as
a child and it had an impact on me then so I thought I should revisit
the piece 20 years later. Absolutely not disappointed.

This film is by no means flawless. Its various problems have been well
documented, but I have to say this is a film that stays with you over
the years. <br><br>The ambiance is unique, there is nothing else like it - although
everyone else pinched bits of it! The film has a charm way beyond that
which it is technically entitled to.<br><br>If the environmentalism seems laid on with a trowel, remember this film
would have been one of the first, if not *the* first, to put such
things on the big screen. Subtlety would only work I think, when the
audience is already familiar with the basic premise - that concreting
over the entire planet is not such a good idea. <br><br>It has a message beyond the fairly obvious environmental one though -
the sheer contentment earned by those who do what is necessary,
regardless of the thanks they won't get for it! The hero is not
especially smart, but hes still smarter than everyone else. We are used
to our heroes being mostly perfect, but where is that written in stone?
This is just one bad tempered hippy, who for his crimes, gets followed
around the place by a screaming Joan Baez.<br><br>Notable also for one of the saddest scenes in the history of film - the
two droids staring with complete incomprehension at the remains of
their friend.

I'm not sure if SILENT RUNNING is up there with other sci-fi classics
such as FORBIDDEN PLANET, 2001, PLANET OF THE APES or ALIEN but I think
that it deserves a mention. It's a typical 70's sci-fi where the earth
has experienced some form of Armageddon either through war, a
biological disaster, overpopulation, pollution or massive environmental
catastrophe. Often with these type of movies you are left scratching
your head trying to figure out what happened to the earth and how did
they manage to into that mess? The plots can become convoluted and the
premises pretty far fetched. Although it is true in this film it never
the less is absorbing viewing not least because of Bruce Derns
performance and his portrayal of the character Lowell. Again we are
years in the future and the earth is void of forests with it's natural
habitat. It now only exists in an artificial environment in outer space
housed in domes.<br><br>Bruce Dern as Lowell was well cast in this and is very believable as
the odd man out in the crew of the 'Valley Forge' space freighter. The
other members of the crew come across as the equivalent of company
roughnecks that can't wait to return to the earth whatever it
resembles. They are the face of the ""ugly American"" that you would run
into in any bar in the USA swigging beer and stuffing their face with
hot buffalo wings who would be more interested in NASCAR, college hoops
or a pre-season Mets game than anything of real substance or
importance. Lowell comes across as eccentric by comparison because he
has a soul and is troubled by the companies decision to destroy the
last remaining forests, presumably because of cost, what else? <br><br>Bruce Dern steals the show with his performance. At the beginning he is
overbearing as he preaches to his crew mates, yet this is tempered by
the viewers irritation towards them with their attitude, ignorance and
stupidity . As they mock and make fun of him, Lowell becomes more
likable despite his obsessive personality. The viewer begins to despise
the rest of the crew and their crass attitude towards their
responsibilities, you have little sympathy for them when Lowell decides
to sacrifice them for the greater good as he see's it. However, because
he has a conscience he is riddled with guilt over their deaths but
never the less sees it as the only way to save what is left of the
earths natural beauty. In the end you like Lowell, he is kind, is
compassionate and is prepared to sacrifice himself to make sure that
what is left will survive. <br><br>Although the special effects are very Gerry Anderson i.e. UFO,
THUNDERBIRDS etc and it is all made in a studio it's still an
interesting and entertaining watch, it's very colourful with great
definition and has been digitally restored. Perhaps a remake should be
done, maybe George Clooney as Lowell?

Originally having seen this film years back, all I could remember were a few
squatty little robots, some kind of personal crusade, and alot of tears from
Bruce Dern.  Now, after a few years of having the film in my collection, 
I'm relieved to say that I recall (know) alot more about the underlying
storyline therein.  Silent Running is by no means a great science fiction
film; it is instead a simplistic story about one man's refusal to destroy
that which is dear to his heart, against all odds.  
What makes this film stand out from others, however, is a combination of
great special effects (Trumbull was, of course, mentored by Stanley Kubrick
on the set of 2001), a good message and... All of that emotion from Bruce
Dern.  I must admit that, even after all these years, those tearful moments
when Dern breaks down stick in my imagination.
Looking for a fabulous, laser blastin', grostesque alien, hyperspace shoot
'em up?  Then don't rent Silent Running.  However, if you are in the mood
for a light, (not too preachy) thoughtful, sci-fi tale of a lonely, one-way
journey, check this one out.

dimness of the station against the vast implacability of space. Maybe you'd

doesn't need them.<br><br>Then why is it my nomination? Because when it was over, I had to turn off
the TV -- couldn't let its mood and memory be violated by a late-nite

more) would have denied it the respect it deserved.<br><br>If you must, watch it as just more fodder for your entertainment urge. But
if your soul is deeper than that... if you can, as Bruce Dern does, put
yourself in the place of a character who so cares about the earth and its

I remember first seeing this film on television I think in 1973 and
being mesmerized by it.  Even though I found the the premise to be
absurd (more on that below), the story and movie triumphs
regardless.  This is flim making at its most brilliant.  With the
exception of Terrence Malick's ""Badlands,"" I cannot think of a finer
directorial debut.  It is one of the tragedies of contemporary
cinema, that Douglas Trumbull could not find any work as a
director for years afterwards.  What a loss!  The studio completely
blew it.<br><br>The movie.  Yes, the premise is incoherent and it has to be dealt
with.  Sometime in the early years of the next century what is left of
America's forests are gathered up and put on space freighters and
shipped to . . . Saturn.  Why is most unclear.  Putting the forest
domes in orbit around earth would have made perfect sense.
Moreover, the film goes to great lengths to show that the robots are
fully capable of tending to them alone so the whole bit about the
unhappy human crew is unnecessary.  But off to Saturn we go
(where the light for the plants -- surprise -- is really bad).<br><br>I understand that Trumbull was thinking of an alien contact story
initially -- I am certain to be going out on a limb on this one -- which
seemed to bear some resemblence to the Poul Anderson novella
""Southern Cross.""  The aliens were soon dumped, however.  What
remained turned out to be an utterly compelling psychological
drama of a man alone in space that is unlike any SF movie I have
seen (it does bear some similarity to a few Twilight Zone
episodes, however).<br><br>This is an astonishing technical achievement in movie making.
Everything about this film works: music, effects, photography, sets,
acting, editing, direction, you name it.  Folks, this was done for all
of one million dollars and is a hundred times more compelling
than films that cost a hundred times as much.  This is art.  This is
literature.  Get the DVD.  Just sit down an watch it.  This is a lovely,
timeless, piece of work.<br><br>Then weep because they don't make 'em like this anymore.  .

Sometime in the future all the forests on Earth have been
destroyed. The last forests are transported in giant greenhouses
aboard space ships near the planet Saturn. Freeman Lowell,
crew
member of the space vessel Valley Forge, is an outsider and
the
only one who cares about what is left of our planet's nature.
When
orders reach their vessel to destroy the forests, he goes mad.
He
kills off the other crew members and starts a lonely odyssey...<br><br>There's something to be learnt in this movie. More than 30
years
old now, it stands the test of time with its message, as mankind
is
still working on what possibly could end in a scenario like
this.
Bruce Dern may be overacting in some scenes, but his character
is still much more likeable than his crew comrades. Scenery
and
music are beautiful, fitting well to the dark, moving and
unique
story. And this is the movie that made ""Star Wars"" possible.
Director Douglas Trumbull and other SFX masters like John
Dykstra and Richard Yuricich were chosen to work on ""Star
Wars""
because of the state-of-the-arts special effects they did for
""Silent
Running"". In 1971, they were ahead of their time. In fact, they
are
easily as good as today's CGI effects, but much more memorable
for their time. Even the droids that help Lowell are predecessors
of
the ones in ""Star Wars""... A must-see movie for SF fans
and
everybody interested in Hollywood classics.

Maybe one of the most moving things about this film is the fact that
the drones (small droids) give such powerful performances without ever
being able to utter a word. Maybe a ""nod"" in some ways to the days of
the silent movie. The environmental message is as powerful today as it
was in 1972.<br><br>An extremely good yet brief film that I felt I had to comment upon it.
Enjoyed the hippy theme tune as well just because it fitted right in.
These types of film are rare but precious. I remember watching this as
a child and it had an impact on me then so I thought I should revisit
the piece 20 years later. Absolutely not disappointed.

This film is by no means flawless. Its various problems have been well
documented, but I have to say this is a film that stays with you over
the years. <br><br>The ambiance is unique, there is nothing else like it - although
everyone else pinched bits of it! The film has a charm way beyond that
which it is technically entitled to.<br><br>If the environmentalism seems laid on with a trowel, remember this film
would have been one of the first, if not *the* first, to put such
things on the big screen. Subtlety would only work I think, when the
audience is already familiar with the basic premise - that concreting
over the entire planet is not such a good idea. <br><br>It has a message beyond the fairly obvious environmental one though -
the sheer contentment earned by those who do what is necessary,
regardless of the thanks they won't get for it! The hero is not
especially smart, but hes still smarter than everyone else. We are used
to our heroes being mostly perfect, but where is that written in stone?
This is just one bad tempered hippy, who for his crimes, gets followed
around the place by a screaming Joan Baez.<br><br>Notable also for one of the saddest scenes in the history of film - the
two droids staring with complete incomprehension at the remains of
their friend.

I'm not sure if SILENT RUNNING is up there with other sci-fi classics
such as FORBIDDEN PLANET, 2001, PLANET OF THE APES or ALIEN but I think
that it deserves a mention. It's a typical 70's sci-fi where the earth
has experienced some form of Armageddon either through war, a
biological disaster, overpopulation, pollution or massive environmental
catastrophe. Often with these type of movies you are left scratching
your head trying to figure out what happened to the earth and how did
they manage to into that mess? The plots can become convoluted and the
premises pretty far fetched. Although it is true in this film it never
the less is absorbing viewing not least because of Bruce Derns
performance and his portrayal of the character Lowell. Again we are
years in the future and the earth is void of forests with it's natural
habitat. It now only exists in an artificial environment in outer space
housed in domes.<br><br>Bruce Dern as Lowell was well cast in this and is very believable as
the odd man out in the crew of the 'Valley Forge' space freighter. The
other members of the crew come across as the equivalent of company
roughnecks that can't wait to return to the earth whatever it
resembles. They are the face of the ""ugly American"" that you would run
into in any bar in the USA swigging beer and stuffing their face with
hot buffalo wings who would be more interested in NASCAR, college hoops
or a pre-season Mets game than anything of real substance or
importance. Lowell comes across as eccentric by comparison because he
has a soul and is troubled by the companies decision to destroy the
last remaining forests, presumably because of cost, what else? <br><br>Bruce Dern steals the show with his performance. At the beginning he is
overbearing as he preaches to his crew mates, yet this is tempered by
the viewers irritation towards them with their attitude, ignorance and
stupidity . As they mock and make fun of him, Lowell becomes more
likable despite his obsessive personality. The viewer begins to despise
the rest of the crew and their crass attitude towards their
responsibilities, you have little sympathy for them when Lowell decides
to sacrifice them for the greater good as he see's it. However, because
he has a conscience he is riddled with guilt over their deaths but
never the less sees it as the only way to save what is left of the
earths natural beauty. In the end you like Lowell, he is kind, is
compassionate and is prepared to sacrifice himself to make sure that
what is left will survive. <br><br>Although the special effects are very Gerry Anderson i.e. UFO,
THUNDERBIRDS etc and it is all made in a studio it's still an
interesting and entertaining watch, it's very colourful with great
definition and has been digitally restored. Perhaps a remake should be
done, maybe George Clooney as Lowell?

Originally having seen this film years back, all I could remember were a few
squatty little robots, some kind of personal crusade, and alot of tears from
Bruce Dern.  Now, after a few years of having the film in my collection, 
I'm relieved to say that I recall (know) alot more about the underlying
storyline therein.  Silent Running is by no means a great science fiction
film; it is instead a simplistic story about one man's refusal to destroy
that which is dear to his heart, against all odds.  
What makes this film stand out from others, however, is a combination of
great special effects (Trumbull was, of course, mentored by Stanley Kubrick
on the set of 2001), a good message and... All of that emotion from Bruce
Dern.  I must admit that, even after all these years, those tearful moments
when Dern breaks down stick in my imagination.
Looking for a fabulous, laser blastin', grostesque alien, hyperspace shoot
'em up?  Then don't rent Silent Running.  However, if you are in the mood
for a light, (not too preachy) thoughtful, sci-fi tale of a lonely, one-way
journey, check this one out.

A fabulous 60s Musical - 4 London Bus mechanics strike up a deal with London Transport. They do up a double decker London Bus, drive it around Europe as a hotel and if they make it they will own and be in charge of a whole fleet. While on the road in France they pick up 3 ladies whose car breaks down and offer to take them to their next singing job in Athens. They also pick up a stowaway. A young, American boy. Meanwhile, a young American female singer has gone missing. Her mother (who is a VERY ambitious woman) and her aid take the story to the press and it makes the front page. They do all they can to make the story run for as long as possible, including misdirecting the bus up an extremely steep Yugoslavian hill. We find out the young American boy is actually the young American girl who is missing. Mayhem ensues as the lead character, Don (Cliff Richard) falls for Barbara.

He was then known as Britain\'s answer to Elvis Presley. His first film was Serious Charge (1959) followed by Expresso Bongo (1959), The Young Ones (1961) and Summer Holiday (1963). The Young Ones (1961) and Summer Holiday (1963) were both massive hits for Cliff in Britain and overseas where Cliff was now a major pop star. His next film, Wonderful Life (1964) was not as successful as his other films. His later films were Finders Keepers (1966), Two a Penny (1967) and Take Me High (1973). Cliff has retained his popularity as a pop star in most parts of the world (except the US) as a major pop star and has had nearly 150 hit singles in the UK charts.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Randal Sheppard <sheppard@main.starnet.com>          Trivia (15)      ""We Don\'t Talk Anymore"" (1979) is his best-selling single with almost five million copies sold worldwide. ""Private Collection"" (1988) is his best-selling album with almost two million copies sold.      He represented the United Kingdom in The Eurovision Song Contest (1973) (Concours Eurovision de la chanson) in 1968 - ""Congratulations"" & 1973 - ""Power to all our friends"".      His sisters are Jacqueline Ann (born 21 November 1947), Joan (born 1950) and Donella ""Donna"" (born 1943).      He has more Top 10 hits than any other artist - 65 at the last count (including 14 no.1s).      He is the third artist after Elvis Presley and The Beatles (joint 17) with the highest number of #1 hits in the UK.      He had 14 #1 hits between 1958 and 1999 - including his single ""The Millenium Prayer"" which reached #1 in November 1999.      He sparked rumors of a retirement on December 1999 after several radio stations playlisted his single ""The Millennium Prayer"" on that month.      He is the only singer in the history of music to have a #1 hit in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.      He figures prominently in Brendan O\'Carroll\'s hilarious comic novel, ""The Mammy"" in which Agnes Browne, the main character, fulfills her life-long dream of ""a dance with Cliff Richard on Christmas Eve"" at the end of the novel. In the film Agnes Browne (1999) (The Mammy), he was replaced by Tom Jones, who plays himself.      He was awarded the O.B.E. (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 1980 for his services to music. He was knighted for services to charity in 1995, becoming the first of several UK pop stars to be knighted.      He was estimated in 2006 to have sold 250 million albums during his career.      He was the winner of the British Record Industry Award for British Male Solo Artist in 1977. He was the winner of the British Phonographic Industry Award for British Male Solo Artist in 1982. He was the winner of the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution in 1989.      On 11 November 2004, he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame for his outstanding contribution to British music and integral part of British music culture.      He announced his conversion to Christianity in 1966. He has never married and claims to have observed a celibate lifestyle since then.      He was spoofed in an episode of the BBC television series Doomwatch (1970), Doomwatch: Sex and Violence, which has never been transmitted due to fears Richard would take legal action.Personal Quotes (20)      If I\'m in the middle of hitting a most fantastic cross-court backhand top spin and someone says, ""Can you stop now and have sex? I\'ll say, ""No, thanks!:      In the political climate, this whole political correctness thing bugs me like mad. I was so upset when they said they were going to call the lights in London winter lights. I\'m saying, ""Hello, I\'ve got friends who are Asian, I wish them Happy Diwali, they wish me Happy Christmas"". In fact, they enjoy Christmas. And when I\'ve been there and there\'s Diwali going on I\'ve enjoyed that, too, to be honest with you. I\'m not so sure why they\'re so upset about the sensitivity of other religions who actually don\'t mind that we celebrate Christmas. Even in schools now I keep reading about how Christianity isn\'t necessarily taught anymore. I\'m thinking, ""Wait a minute. If I went to live in another country and it had a different faith and philosophy and I joined in there . . . If I was a kid and went to school, I would have to learn what they learn as well"".      [on Elvis Presley] Elvis was my idol from the beginning and even today when I\'m alone I\'ll often put on the ""King Creole"" album. He\'s produced the most exciting pop music sounds of all time.      I\'m aware of the rumors but I am not gay.      Rock\'n\'roll can manage without the sex and drugs.      There is no room in my life for drugs, fights, divorce, adultery, sadism, unnecessary fuss and sex.      As for my sexuality I am sick to death of the media\'s speculation about it. What business is it of anyone else\'s what any of us are as individuals? I don\'t think my fans would care either way.      By the time The Beatles came in, we could link four-track machines instead of performing in mono. The Beatles could be very creative and the ingenuity they showed was terrific; absolutely fantastic sounds and great songs.      Nobody\'s going to catch me now. I\'ve had number ones in five decades. Who\'s going to do that? First of all, they\'ve got to be around for five decades. Many of them barely make five years.      [on meeting Freddie Mercury in 1986] I have to say that previously, I had never been a fan of Freddie\'s [Freddie Mercury] in terms of his kind of vocals but I certainly admired his ability, including his skill on the piano and, of course, he was such an extrovert showman. Just the year before when Queen did Live Aid (1985), although I myself couldn\'t take part as I was committed to a gospel charity gig in Birmingham, I managed to see snatches of the show and the second I saw Freddie launch into their act, it was obvious that Queen were going to steal the show. When they returned to Wembley during their Magic tour, I couldn\'t go to see them because I was on stage with Time but they invited me to their after show party. These kinds of parties are always the same - crowds of people, most of whom spend hours lining up to meet the star for usually no more than minutes, so it is not really conducive to getting to know someone.      The media seemed to want to have an answer to Elvis. What they forgot was he was not a question. There was no answer to Elvis. Elvis will always be Elvis. He will be the prototype rock and roll singer. He gave this new music a shape, a face, and the rest us just tried to tag on and some of us got lucky.      I am the Ultimate Pop Star and no one can take that away from me. A few years ago, Channel 4 did a programme called The Ultimate Pop Star (2004) - and it turns out I have sold more singles than not just Elvis, but everybody. That\'s my big claim to fame.      Being out of tune, I find it unforgivable.      My only gripe is when critics writing the history of rock\'n\'roll leave me out altogether.      For me a big hit is to be in the top five. I don\'t subscribe to the view that if you\'re not number one, it\'s a failure. Maybe that\'s why people disappear so quickly these days, because they have that attitude.      [on ""Millennium Prayer""] That was one of the hardest number ones I have had. I was confused by all the negative reaction and Mistletoe and Wine may have kicked that off. I had found myself in the charts way past my [supposed] sell-by date and maybe that annoyed people.      Airplay is vital for single hits. The only way I can have a fair competition is if your records are on the radio - gone are the days where the likes of myself, Elton John, Tina Turner, Phil Collins have our records played. There is an ageism in the radio industry. If you ask me to record a new song, I\'m not sure it would get the support it needs.      [on his refusal to boycott apartheid South Africa, which earned him a place on the United Nations\' blacklist] I go wherever Christians invite me to speak about Jesus. It\'s a platform I\'ve been given by God.      [in 2014] For many months I have been aware of allegations against me of historic impropriety which have been circulating online. The allegations are completely false. Up until now I have chosen not to dignify the false allegations with a response, as it would just give them more oxygen. However, the police attended my apartment in Berkshire today without notice, except, it would appear, to the press. I am not presently in the UK but it goes without saying that I will co-operate fully should the police wish to speak to me. Beyond stating that today\'s allegation is completely false it would not be appropriate to say anything further until the police investigation has concluded.      [on homosexual marriage] I think the Church must come round and see people as they are now. Gone are the days when we assumed loving relationships would be solely between men and women. It seems to me that commitment is the issue, and if anyone comes to me and says: \'This is my partner; we are committed to each other\', then I don\'t care what their sexuality is. I\'m not going to judge; I\'ll leave that to God.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nLauri Peters ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 9 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(1)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(6)  Overview (1)Date of Birth2\xa0July1943,\xa0Detroit, Michigan, USA Mini Bio (1)          Lauri played the young and startlingly cute ""Mayblossom Haggan"", the sweet, down-home, Texas cousin promised to marry ""Festus Haggan"", in the 1964 episode Gunsmoke: Mayblossom (1964).

The second of three very-well produced films starring Cliff and The
Shadows,
sees them fixing up a London double-decker bus to tour the Continent, and
meet girls on the way.Some silly plot about a runaway American
girl-pretending-to-be-a-boy doesn't really get in the way of colorful
location lensing in CinemaScope, or the songs and music.Cliff was just as
handsome and talented a performer as Elvis in his own right, and still
knocks 'em dead in appearances to this date, around the world. Goodonyer,

fame
as ""Fagin"" in the musical, ""Oliver""

Redefines family entertainment.  I had totally forgotten about this
mini-musical until I came across it on the IMDb just five minutes ago,
whilst looking for something else that I really don't care about
now.<br><br>Dear old Sir Cliff! What a time to be 18/19! I was actually just 17 when
this came out and so hopelessly in love with my cousin there WAS nothing
else in my life at the time. God was feeling charitable towards me in those
days and orchestrated events so that she happened to come to my hometown and
stay over. I asked her to go to the local theater with me and we sat in the
back row watching this film....least SHE did, I had other things on my mind!
What does the plot matter?   Cliff as a bus driver taking his friends
(Cliff's backing group - The Shadows...how odd I can remember those
names...Jet Harris, Tony Meehan and Hank Marvin....and I haven't even
thought about them for forty years!) on a European vacation and picking up
girls on the way - between songs of course.<br><br>God! I'd like to see this again! I still have the original 45 rpm release!

a rage in Hollywood. Sir Cliff Richard totally wows the audience with his
immense onscreen charisma as well as his smooth dance moves.<br><br>This well-cast movie also has Cliff Richard singing the theme song, albeit

After doing up a London double-decker as a sort of mobile home, Don and
his friends set out to travel across Europe for a fantastic summer
holiday. Along the way they pick up a group of English girls and a
young boy. However when the young boy turns out to be a missing female
celebrity the group find themselves getting into many adventures as her
agents try to keep her 'missing' for as long as possible to get her the
headlines. Meanwhile, Don has his own problems as the self confessed
'bachelor boy' finds himself falling in love.<br><br>Given that the cassette soundtrack to this film was officially 'the
first album I ever bought', I took the chance (for the first time since
then!) to watch the actual film again. With the thinnest of connections
to the Olympics (the group's destination is Athens) this film was
screened during the day of the opening ceremony of the 2004 games and I
took the opportunity to video it for later viewing. The film was pretty
much what I expected it to be in that it was cheesy, silly and not that
good  just what you would expect from a pop musical of the period that
aimed to be nothing more than inoffensive family fun. The plot is
basically a road trip with a very obvious romance acting as the driving
force for a series of amusing antics and pop songs. None of it is very
good but it is reasonably OK and is worth seeing as a piece of fun.<br><br>The antics are not that funny but they have a great sense of 'clean
fun'  hard to describe but easy to get into if you are in the mood for
it. Of course, modern, more cynical audiences will find it a major turn
off but it is quite fun in a very basic sense. Likewise the songs are
hardly great and can be best described as 'clean' and 'wholesome' with
the odd one being memorable or catchy but mostly them just doing the
job and nothing more. The cast also fit with this 'clean fun' family
ideal and the plot never dares suggest that a bus load of young men and
woman would do anything alone in cramped rooms around Europe! Heck 
one of the guys even complains about the number of girls on the bus 
sorry? what?! They fall into pure, clean love and that's about it, with
the cast never doing more than smiling. Complain all you want though,
about his appeal to older fans, but Cliff Richard was a consistent
presence in the UK charts and here he shows that he has a real light,
natural charisma that suits the film perfectly  he is hardly giving a
great performance but he is well suited. Hayes provides some laughs but
the rest of the guys are a bit lame while the women are represented
with sexless and poor performances from the flat Peters and the 'too
smiley by half' Stubbs.<br><br>So no, it isn't a good film but it is good, clean family fun that may
suit you for an afternoon viewing. The songs, the tone and the cast are
all cheap and light  not adding anything to the thin plot or material
but they suit a film that tries to be nothing more than family fun and,
as such, it is rather enjoyable even if I should really know better.

Very dated teenage offering which is unlikely to appeal to anyone
anymore, though the spectacle of a London bus trundling through real
European locations has a certain bizarre appeal. Mr Richard has an
innocuous personality, an innocuous voice, and this film is all good
clean very innocuous fun. The producers have made a big effort not to
upstage Mr. Richard's very moderate talents. They do this by
surrounding him with folk noticeably less talented and/or attractive.
Still, girls are girls.<br><br>OTHER VIEWS: Attractive 18-year-old American actress and dancer Lauri
Peters makes her British film debut as Cliff Richard's leading lady in
the new Associated British musical, ""Summer Holiday"". Lauri,
fair-haired with dark eyes and a mischievous face, was chosen by
producer Kenneth Harper for the role after he had flown to see her in
New York on the recommendation of American choreographer Herb Ross, who
moulded the thrilling dance numbers from Cliff's previous success, ""The
Young Ones"", and who has engineered some even more spectacular numbers
for ""Summer Holiday"". Herb had seen Lauri's work in a Broadway show
called ""First Impressions"", and it was Lauri's own first impression
which won her the ""Summer Holiday"" part. Lauri was born in Michigan and
began studying ballet when she was six. Her ambitions have always
veered towards acting and dancing and her early rigorous training paid
off.  Associated British publicity.

Summer Holiday is an early example of the pop musical. It was a vehicle
for Cliff Richard, who was at this stage a British rock 'n' roll
superstar. He also had a squeaky clean image and Summer Holiday
certainly does nothing to alter this view. It's about four friends who
go on a continental European trip in a London double-decker bus they
have converted into a mobile home. They pick up some girls along the
way and a series of japes follows soon after.<br><br>The story-line is pretty negligible and is a distant second to the
scenic locations and songs. Of the latter, there are a few memorable
ones but they're mostly not very good really, although the tune played
by The Shadows in the nightclub was actually pretty great. Aside from
this the movie is primarily made up of light-hearted comedy, with a
little bit of romance thrown in for good measure. I guess you could
describe it all as charming but I personally thought it to be a little
too excessively twee for my tastes and found the comedy a bit wearing
after a bit. But it's sort of hard to truly dislike and is kind of okay
for what it is.

I first saw this flick not in a theater, but on TV back in the late 1970s.
It was a very pleasant musical (for what it is), and it shows the
so-called

Outstanding musical which topped the UK box office that year, as did
The Young Ones the previous year. The storyline is straightforward, but
the songs, fashions and odd Brit quirks make this a superb piece of pop
history. Cliff is superbly naive and the film is primarily a vehicle to
sell his music, but it goes beyond that and is harmless, camp, iconic
and superbly dated. Watch it and remember! As for being the British
Elvis, I'm not convinced. Cliff always speaks highly of Elvis, but the
two are not alike and probably shouldn't be compared. While there are
several other films by Cliff, this and the Young Ones are the ones to
watch. Wonderful Life had the same basic cast and formula, but lacked
direction. Later films, like Take me High, while offering an idea of
the 70's, don't quite cut it either. Stick to the big 2 and you
shouldn't be disappointed.

I hate it when people review films like the ""High School Musical""
series as if they're supposed to be ""Citizen Kane,"" so I'm happy to see
that the reviewers here took ""Summer Holiday"" for what it was - teen
fun in the sun with lots of music, dancing, color, and a plot so thin
you could barely discern it.<br><br>It stars that British phenomenon, Sir Cliff Richard, who has the
distinction of having top ten hits in the U.K. for every decade through
the '90s and today, in his seventies, is still touring and selling out
venues. Yet he barely made a ripple here in the states, with the
exception of ""Devil Woman"" and ""We Don't Talk Anymore."" The story
concerns three lads who fix up a double decker tour bus and travel
through Europe, picking up three young women whose car has been
damaged, plus a runaway (Lauri Peters) and later a St. Bernard dog
along the way. The runaway is actually a well-known American singer
disguised as a boy, and her mother tries to make it look as if she's
been kidnapped in order to get publicity.<br><br>Strangely Lauri Peters is American and was the original Broadway Liesl
in the Sound of Music - she sounded about as American as Queen
Elizabeth. She is a wonderful singer and didn't get to show off her
voice enough in this film.<br><br>There's a nice exuberance in this film and some very upbeat musical
numbers. Richard, a huge teen idol, was adorable and still looks great,
in fact. For biggest selling musical artists in the UK, Richard ranks
third behind the Beatles and Elvis.<br><br>Supposedly the British Elvis, if one thinks of Richard that way, he
comes in a poor second. There was only one Elvis, and Richard needs to
be taken on his own abilities. He lacks the oozing sexuality in
presence and voice of Elvis, though he considered Elvis his absolute
inspiration. He could dance better than Elvis, and his singing is sweet
and polished, with none of Elvis' passion. And had Elvis not been under
the thumb of Colonel Parker, we would have seen more evidence of Elvis'
ability as an actor, which was definitely there. Richard's? Handsome,
magnetic, a wonderful presence, but acting, not so much. Had Elvis
lived drug-free and lasted longer, he would have enjoyed Richard's
amazing longevity. Strangely, Elvis had a spiritual bend, as does
Richard, and Elvis was known for being a gentleman, as is Richard.<br><br>However, all that being said, Richard's films Summer Holiday and
Wonderful to be Young and Elvis' films have things in common, two
things especially: they were geared to young audiences and they were
megahits. Enjoy. Enough said.

His parents, Bryna (Sanglel) and Herschel Danielovitch, were Jewish immigrants from Chavusy, Mahilyow Voblast (now in Belarus). Although growing up in a poor ghetto, Douglas was a fine student and a keen athlete and wrestled competitively during his time at St. Lawrence University. However, he soon identified an acting scholarship as a way out of his meager existence, and was sufficiently talented to gain entry into the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He only appeared in a handful of minor Broadway productions before joining the US Navy in 1941, and then after the end of hostilities in 1945, returned to the theater and some radio work. On the insistence of ex-classmate Lauren Bacall movie producer Hal B. Wallis screen-tested Douglas and cast him in the lead role in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946). His performance received rave reviews and further work quickly followed, including an appearance in the low-key drama I Walk Alone (1947), the first time he worked alongside fellow future screen legend Burt Lancaster. Such was the strong chemistry between the two that they appeared in seven films together, including the dynamic western Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), the John Frankenheimer political thriller Seven Days in May (1964) and their final pairing in the gangster comedy Tough Guys (1986). Douglas once said about his good friend: ""I\'ve finally gotten away from Burt Lancaster. My luck has changed for the better. I\'ve got nice-looking girls in my films now"".After appearing in ""I Walk Alone"", Douglas scored his first Oscar nomination playing the untrustworthy and opportunistic boxer Midge Kelly in the gripping Champion (1949). The quality of his work continued to garner the attention of critics and he was again nominated for Oscars for his role as a film producer in The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) and as tortured painter Vincent van Gogh in Lust for Life (1956), both directed by Vincente Minnelli. In 1955 Douglas launched his own production company, Bryna Productions, the company behind two pivotal film roles in his career. The first was as French army officer Col. Dax in director Stanley Kubrick\'s brilliant anti-war epic Paths of Glory (1957). Douglas reunited with Kubrick for yet another epic, the magnificent Spartacus (1960). The film also marked a key turning point in the life of screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy ""Red Scare"" hysteria in the 1950s. At Douglas\' insistence Trumbo was given on-screen credit for his contributions, which began the dissolution of the infamous blacklisting policies begun almost a decade previously that had destroyed so many careers and lives.Douglas remained busy throughout the 1960s, starring in many films,. He played a rebellious modern-day cowboy in Lonely Are the Brave (1962), acted alongside John Wayne in the World War II story In Harm\'s Way (1965), again with The Duke in a drama about the Israeli fight for independence, Cast a Giant Shadow (1966), and once more with Wayne in the tongue-in-cheek western The War Wagon (1967). Additionally, in 1963 he starred in an onstage production of Ken Kesey\'s ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo\'s Nest"", but despite his keen interest, no Hollywood studio could be convinced to bring the story to the screen. However, the rights remained with the Douglas clan, and Kirk\'s talented son Michael Douglas finally filmed the tale in 1975, starring Jack Nicholson. Into the 1970s Douglas wasn\'t as busy as previous years; however, he starred in some unusual vehicles, including alongside a young Arnold Schwarzenegger in the loopy western comedy The Villain (1979), then with Farrah Fawcett in the sci-fi thriller Saturn 3 (1980) and then he traveled to Australia for the horse opera/drama The Man from Snowy River (1982).Unknown to many, Kirk has long been involved in humanitarian causes and has been a Goodwill Ambassador for the US State Department since 1963. His efforts were rewarded in 1981 with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and in 1983 with the Jefferson Award. Furthermore, the French honored him with the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. More recognition followed for his work with the American Cinema Award (1987), the German Golden Kamera Award (1987), The National Board of Reviews Career Achievement Award (1989), an honorary Academy Award (1995), Recipient of the American Film Institute\'s Lifetime Achievement Award (1999) and the UCLA Medal of Honor (2002). Despite a helicopter crash and a stroke suffered in the 1990s, he remains active and continues to appear in front of the camera.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       firehouse44                    Kirk Douglas is an American actor, producer, director, and author. After an impoverished childhood with immigrant parents and six sisters, he had his film debut in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s and 1960s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war movies. During a sixty-year acting career, he has appeared in over 90 movies, and in 1960 was responsible for helping to end the Hollywood Blacklist.In 1949, after a lead role as an unscrupulous boxing hero in Champion, for which he was nominated as Best Actor, Douglas became a star. His style of acting relied on expressing great concentration, realism, and powerful emotions, and he subsequently gravitated toward roles requiring strong characters. Among his early films were Young Man with a Horn, playing opposite Lauren Bacall (1950), Billy Wilder\'s controversial Ace in the Hole (1951), and Detective Story (1951). He received a second Oscar nomination for his dramatic role in The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), where he played opposite Lana Turner. His powerful acting performance as Vincent van Gogh in Lust for Life (1956) is considered one of his finest roles. He is among the last surviving stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood.In 1955, he established Bryna Productions, which began producing films as varied as Paths of Glory (1957) and Spartacus (1960). In those two films, he starred and collaborated with then relatively unknown director, Stanley Kubrick. Douglas helped break the Hollywood blacklist by having Dalton Trumbo write Spartacus with an official on-screen credit, although Trumbo\'s family claims he overstated his role. He produced and starred in Lonely Are the Brave (1962), considered a cult classic, and Seven Days in May (1964), opposite Burt Lancaster, with whom he made seven films. In 1963, he starred in the Broadway play One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest, a story he purchased, which he later gave to his son Michael Douglas, who turned it into an Oscar-winning film.As an actor and philanthropist, Douglas has received three Academy Award nominations, an Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, and the Medal of Freedom. As an author, he has written ten novels and memoirs. Currently, he is No. 17 on the American Film Institute\'s list of the greatest male screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema, and the highest-ranked living person on the list. After barely surviving a helicopter crash in 1991 and then suffering a stroke in 1996, he has focused on renewing his spiritual and religious life. He lives with producer Anne Buydens, his wife of over 60 years.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Pedro Borges          Spouse (2) Anne Douglas (29 May\xa01954            - present)\xa0(2 children)           Diana Douglas (2 November\xa01943            - 23 February\xa01951)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(2 children)          Trade Mark (3)        Gravelly voice        Dimpled chin        Frequently played manipulative, angry and often cruel leading characters that bordered on unsympathetic but were always compellingTrivia (87)      Ranked #53 in Empire (UK) magazine\'s ""The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time"" list, October 1997.      Born Issur Danielovitch (also reported as Issur Danielovitch Demsky) to father Jacob Danielovitch, and mother Bryna, from Russia, who came to America in 1912.      Suffered a stroke in January 1996 that made it very difficult for him to talk. Speech therapy over the years greatly alleviated the problem.      Received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Jimmy Carter on 17th January 1981. This is the highest US honor a civilian can receive.      Turned down two Oscar-winning roles: Lee Marvin\'s in Cat Ballou (1965) and William Holden\'s in Stalag 17 (1953).      Father of 4 sons: Michael Douglas, Eric Douglas, Joel Douglas and Peter Douglas.      Earned $50,000 for saying the only English word at the end of a 1980s Japanese TV commercial: ""Coffee"".

Granddaughter Carys Zeta Douglas born April 21, 2003.      Inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 1984.      Father-in-law of Catherine Zeta-Jones.      Was originally cast to play Col. Sam Trautman in First Blood (1982), but walked out on the project. Douglas wanted substantial changes made to the script, specifically that John Rambo die at the hands of Trautman, like the character did in the novel. The writers held their ground and refused. Richard Crenna was eventually cast in the role.      He was voted the 36th Greatest Movie Star of all time by Entertainment Weekly.      He wore lifts in many of his films, which made him appear about 5\' 11"" or 6 feet on screen. Once, as a prank, Burt Lancaster found Douglas\'s lifts on a film set and hid them from him, which allegedly infuriated the shorter actor.      Douglas had a fully Jewish upbringing, but did not practice extensively as an adult. This changed when, on his 83rd birthday, he had a second Bar Mitzvah, reaffirming his faith and causing him to practice again.      Was named #17 greatest actor on The 50 Greatest Screen Legends list by the American Film Institute.      Had a pacemaker fitted after collapsing in a restaurant in August 1986.      President of jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 1980.      Member of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 1970.      He and Burt Lancaster acted together in 7 movies: Victory at Entebbe (1976), Tough Guys (1986), Seven Days in May (1964), The List of Adrian Messenger (1963), I Walk Alone (1947), Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957) and The Devil\'s Disciple (1959).      He had both knees replaced in 2005, against the advice of his doctors. The operation was a success.      After his son Michael Douglas was fired from the stage production of the play ""Summer Tree"", Kirk bought the stage and film rights to the story and gave it to Michael to star in.      Grandfather of 7 children: Cameron Douglas (b. 13 December 1978), Dylan Michael Douglas (b. 8 August 2000), Carys Zeta Douglas (b. 20 April 2003) (children of his son Michael Douglas), Kelsey (b. 1992), Tyler (b. 1996), Ryan (b. 2000) and Jason (b. 2003) (children of his son Peter Douglas)      Former father-in-law of Diandra Douglas.      Appeared in a stage production of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest"" and later bought the film rights. He didn\'t make a movie of it and eventually turned the rights over to his son Michael Douglas, who was able to secure financing and produce the film, One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest (1975).      If he had not heeded wife Anne Douglas\'s advice, he would have been on producer Michael Todd\'s private plane in 1958 when it crashed and killed all on-board. Todd\'s wife Elizabeth Taylor was also scheduled to be on the plane but canceled due to a bad cold.      Met his German wife-to-be, Anne Douglas, when she applied for a job as his assistant on the French location shoot for the movie Un acte d\'amour (1953).      He was awarded the American National Medal of Arts in 2001 from the National Endowment of the Arts.      He lived in Palm Springs, CA, for more than 40 years. In October 2005 the city honored him by naming a lushly-landscaped drive ""Kirk Douglas Way"". It winds around part of Palm Springs International Airport. A lavish ceremony and party was given by the Palm Springs International Film Society and International Film Festival and was attended by the actor, his wife Anne Douglas and their three surviving sons. His son Joel, also a Palm Springs resident, was responsible for the campaign.      Gave up his two- to three-pack-a-day cigarette habit in 1950. His father later died from lung cancer in 1955, at the age of 72.      In 1955 he was among the first actors to set up a personal production company, Bryna Productions, after the first name of his mother.      He and his wife Anne Douglas renewed their wedding vows in California around the 50th anniversary of their 1954 marriage. They reaffirmed their vows before 300 friends and family members at the famous Greystone Estate in Beverly Hills. Guests included Dan Aykroyd, Lauren Bacall, Nancy Reagan and Tony Curtis. Douglas walked into the traditional Jewish ceremony to the tune of ""I\'m In The Mood For Love"" and later sang a tune he\'d written for the occasion, ""Please Stay In Love With Me"".      Attended the state funeral of former President Ronald Reagan, with Charlton Heston, Tom Selleck and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, on June 11, 2004.      Helped break the Hollywood blacklist by hiring Dalton Trumbo, a member of the ""Hollywood Ten"", to write the screenplay for Spartacus (1960). Despite widespread criticism from many in the industry, including John Wayne and Hedda Hopper, Douglas refused to back down and Trumbo received screen credit under his own name. When presenting Douglas with an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement at The 68th Annual Academy Awards (1996), Steven Spielberg publicly thanked Douglas for his courage. However, Otto Preminger had already broken the blacklist by hiring Trumbo for Exodus (1960). Trumbo\'s family publicly said that Douglas greatly exaggerated his role in breaking the blacklist.      Attended the premiere of Basic Instinct (1992), which starred his son, Michael Douglas.      Fell out with his close friend, former President Jimmy Carter, over Carter\'s 2006 book ""Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid"".      His idol was President Harry S. Truman.      Confirmed his retirement from acting after making Illusion (2004), although he did act in one more film, Meurtres à l\'Empire State Building (2008), and has had numerous appearances (as himself) on entertainment and gossip programs, and in documentaries.      While filming The War Wagon (1967) in September 1966, Douglas enraged his co-star John Wayne by recording a television advertisement for Edmund G. Brown, the Democratic Governor of California, after Wayne had recorded an advertisement for Republican challenger Ronald Reagan.      Admitted he made The Big Trees (1952) for nothing just to get out of his contract with Warner Bros. He later said, ""It was a terrible movie."".      In his last book, ""Let\'s Face It: 90 Years of Living, Loving and Learning"", he expressed regret at turning down William Holden\'s Oscar-winning role in Stalag 17 (1953), Stephen Boyd\'s role in The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964), and Lee Marvin\'s Oscar-winning role in Cat Ballou (1965).      He was a close friend of Jack Valenti.      He was originally cast in John Wayne\'s role in Sands of Iwo Jima (1949), but pulled out in order to make Champion (1949).      His star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is at 6263 Hollywood Blvd.      Is an avid user of the Internet and is registered with MySpace.      Best of friends with Karl Malden (who was also very close with his son Michael Douglas, with whom he co-starred on The Streets of San Francisco (1972)). After Malden died in 2009, Douglas remarked that their acquaintance was the longest he had with anyone in his life, lasting 70 years.      Made his stage debut in 1942.      He was not close friends with Burt Lancaster as was often perceived. The closeness of their friendship was largely fabricated by the publicity-wise Douglas, while, in reality, they were very competitive with each other and sometimes privately expressed a mutual personal disdain despite a mutual respect for their acting talents.      Speaks French.      Co-hosted (with Cass Elliot) the release party for folk-rocker Donovan\'s 1969 ""Barabajagal"" album, posing for photos with Donovan and Elliot. He described Donovan as ""not just a gentleman, but a gentle man"".      His acting mentor was Gary Cooper.      Release of his book, ""Let\'s Face It: 90 Years of Living, Loving and Learning"" in 2007, at the age of 91. [2007]      Release of his book, ""The Gift"" in 1992. [1992]      Release of his book, ""Climbing the Mountain: My Search for Meaning"", in 1997, at the age of 81. [1997]      Release of his book, ""The Ragman\'s Son: An Autobiography"" published in 1988, and which was also a tribute to his father, who had died in 1950. The book spent many weeks on the New York Times bestseller\'s list, including several weeks at number one. [1988]      Release of his book, ""Last Tango in Brooklyn,"" published in 1984. [1994]      Release of his book, ""My Stroke of Luck,"" published in 2002. [2002]      Release of his book, ""Dance with the Devil,"" published in 1990. [1990]Lonely Are the Brave (1962) is his personal favourite film.      He rejected a key role in The Great Sinner (1949) to star in Champion (1949). He was replaced by Melvyn Douglas.      According to Burt Lancaster in 1987 at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts tribute to Douglas: ""Kirk would be the first person to tell you he\'s a very difficult man."" After a pause he added, "" And I would be the second."".      Douglas\' father changed the family name from Danielovich to Demsky.      Broadway play. Succeeded Richard Widmark in ""Trio."". [1945]Hedda Hopper told him after he became a star with Champion (1949), ""Now that you\'re a big hit, you\'ve become a real S.O.B."" Douglas replied,"" You\'re wrong. I was always an S.O.B. You just never noticed before."".Hal B. Wallis tested him for a role in what would be his film debut in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) after a recommendation by friend Lauren Bacall.      Douglas wrote his autobiography without the help of a ghostwriter - very unusual for a Hollywood bio.      Was signed to play Gabey in On the Town (1949) but had to be replaced because he suffered from a case of psychosomatic laryngitis.      He got out of his contract with Warner Bros. by offering to star in any picture they chose for no salary. The picture was The Big Trees (1952).      Broadway play. ""The Wind Is Ninety"" as the Unkown Soldier of World War I. Directed by Ralph Nelson. (6/21/1945). [1945]      Broadway play ""Raincheck for Joe"" closed during rehearsals. [1945]      When he was contacted by MGM to replace Ricardo Montalban in The Story of Three Loves (1953) because of his box-office power, he refused until he discussed it with Montalban, who was in training for the role. Although Montalban felt appreciative of Douglas\' concern for him, he understood Metro\'s position and surrendered the role.      After winning a scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, he found work as a waiter at Schraft\'s on 86th Treet and Broadway. Among the other aspiring actors working there was John Forsythe.      Douglas claims that painter Marc Chagall asked the actor to play him in a filmography, but the actor turned him down after the rigors of playing painter Vincent Van Gogh in Lust for Life (1956).      Although he played Ernest Borgnine\'s son in The Vikings (1958), he was six weeks his senior in real life.      Cowboy Stan Polson, owner of the Apple Valley Stables, taught Kirk Douglas how to ride a horse for Douglas\'s role in his first western, ""Along the Great Divide"".      Is portrayed by Dean O\'Gorman in Trumbo (2015).      Publicly called for more gun control in the United States in June 2013.      His claim to have broken the blacklist by hiring Dalton Trumbo to write the screenplay for Spartacus (1960) was publicly disputed by Trumbo\'s son and daughter, as well as the film\'s producer Edward Lewis and Howard Fast\'s children.      Douglas claimed to be 5\'11"" at his peak. However he was well known for wearing lifts and many sources say his peak height was 5\'8"".      He released this statement for the release of Trumbo (2015): ""As actors it is easy for us to play the hero. We get to fight the bad guys and stand up for justice. In real life, the choices are not always so clear. The Hollywood Blacklist, recreated powerfully on screen in Trumbo, was a time I remember well. The choices were hard. The consequences were painful and very real. During the blacklist, I had friends who went into exile when no one would hire them; actors who committed suicide in despair. My young co-star in Detective Story (1951), Lee Grant, was unable to work for twelve years after she refused to testify against her husband before the House Un-American Activities Committee. I was threatened that using a Blacklisted writer for Spartacus (1960) - my friend Dalton Trumbo - would mark me as a ""Commie-lover"" and end my career. There are times when one has to stand up for principle. I am so proud of my fellow actors who use their public influence to speak out against injustice. At 98 years old, I have learned one lesson from history: It very often repeats itself. I hope that Trumbo, a fine film, will remind all of us that the Blacklist was a terrible time in our country, but that we must learn from it so that it will never happen again."".      Recipient of the Ellis Island Medal of Honor by the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation in 1986.      He claimed to have become engaged to Pier Angeli while filming The Story of Three Loves (1953).      Friends with Lauren Bacall, Tony Curtis, Ronald Reagan, Nancy Reagan, Don Rickles, Carl Reiner, Carroll O\'Connor, and Steven Spielberg.Personal Quotes (43)      I\'ve finally gotten away from Burt Lancaster. My luck has changed for the better. I\'ve got nice-looking girls in my films now.      Virtue is not photogenic. What is it to be a nice guy? To be nothing, that\'s what. A big fat zero with a smile for everybody.      I\'ve made a career of playing sons of bitches.      In order to achieve anything you must be brave enough to fail.      I came from abject poverty. There was nowhere to go but up.      Making movies is a form of narcissism.      People are always talking about the old days. They say that the old movies were better, that the old actors were so great. But I don\'t think so. All I can say about the old days is that they have passed.      I have always told my sons that they didn\'t have my advantages of being born into abject poverty.      I think half the success in life comes from first trying to find out what you really want to do. And then going ahead and doing it.      Life is like a B-picture script! It is that corny. If I had my life story offered to me to film, I\'d turn it down.      If you want to know about a man you can find out an awful lot by looking at who he married.      My kids never had the advantage I had. I was born poor.      I want my sons to surpass me, because that\'s a form of immortality.      If the good guy gets the girl, it\'s rated PG; If the bad guy gets the girl, it\'s rated R; and if everybody gets the girl, it\'s rated X.      [December 9, 2006] My name is Kirk Douglas. You may know me. If you don\'t . . . Google me. I was a movie star and I\'m Michael Douglas\' dad, Catherine Zeta-Jones\' father-in-law, and the grandparents of their two children. Today I celebrate my 90th birthday. I have a message to convey to America\'s young people. A 90th birthday is special. In my case, this birthday is not only special but miraculous. I survived World War II, a helicopter crash, a stroke, and two new knees. It\'s a tradition that when a ""birthday boy"" stands over his cake he makes a silent wish for his life and then blows out the candles. I have followed that tradition for 89 years but on my 90th birthday, I have decided to rebel. Instead of making a silent wish for myself, I want to make a loud wish for The World. Let\'s face it: The World is in a mess and you are inheriting it. Generation Y, you are on the cusp. You are the group facing many problems: abject poverty, global warming, genocide, AIDS and suicide bombers, to name a few. These problems exist and the world is silent. We have done very little to solve these problems. Now we leave it to you. You have to fix it because the situation is intolerable. You need to rebel, to speak up, write, vote, and care about people and the world you live in. We live in the best country in the world. I know. My parents were Russian immigrants. America is a country where EVERYONE, regardless of race, creed, or age has a chance. I had that chance. You are the generation that is most impacted and the generation that can make a difference. I love this country because I came from a life of poverty. I was able to work my way through college and go into acting, the field that I love. There is no guarantee in this country that you will be successful. But you always have a chance. Nothing should interfere with it. You have to make sure that nothing stands in the way. When I blow out my candles - 90! . . . it will take a long time . . . but I\'ll be thinking of you.      I did four movies with [John Wayne]. We were a strange combination. He was a Republican and I was a Democrat. We argued all the time.      [on Michael Moore\'s interview with Charlton Heston in Bowling for Columbine (2002)] I cannot forgive the way he treated Charlton Heston. Even if I don\'t agree with much of Heston\'s politics, Chuck is a gentleman. He agreed to have an interview with Moore, and Moore took advantage of the situation and made Chuck look foolish. He had been invited to Heston\'s home and he was treated with courtesy. I winced when I saw the expression on Chuck\'s face change as he realized that he had been duped. And yet he remained a gentleman and dismissed the interloper with grace.      [on John Wayne] John Wayne was a star because he always played John Wayne. Frankly, he wasn\'t an excellent actor, but good heavens, what a star! It wasn\'t John Wayne who served the roles; the roles served John Wayne.      [on Linda Darnell] Linda Darnell is the most unspoilt star on the screen -- and also the most beautiful.      [on Doris Day] That face she shows the world -- smiling, only talking good, happy, tuned into God -- as far as I\'m concerned, that\'s just a mask. I haven\'t a clue as to what\'s underneath. Doris is just about the remotest person I know.      I\'ve always believed virtue is not photogenic, and I think I\'ve always been attracted to a part, uh, I\'d rather play the *evil* character, most of the time, than the nice fella. And I think it really *bothered* my mother, because she would tell people, ""You know, my son\'s not like that, he\'s really a nice boy!""      It isn\'t a manly profession. It\'s a childish profession. You couldn\'t be a complete, grown-up adult and be an actor . . . I mean, if I were a sophisticated adult, how could I say, ""Here I am, fighting evil, represented by Yul Brynner""? You have to have a childish part of you! It\'s true! You know, I watch as my kids have grown up, I\'ve watched, them, you know. Children are natural actors; they pretend they\'re cops and robbers, and I think all actors retain a certain amount of that within themselves. They have to, or they can\'t function as actors. And that\'s why they become self-deprecating. They think, well, it\'s not      Senator McCarthy was an awful man who was finding Communists all over the country. He blacklisted the writers who wouldn\'t obey his edict. The heads of the studios were hypocrites who went along with it. My company produced Spartacus, written by Dalton Trumbo, a blacklisted writer, under the name Sam Jackson. Too many people were using false names back then. I was embarrassed. I was young enough to be impulsive, so even though I was warned against it, I used his real name on the screen.      [on the death of Tony Curtis]: Tony Curtis was one of the best-looking guys in Hollywood. He was often described as beautiful, but he was also a fine actor. I worked with Tony in The Vikings (1958) and in Spartacus (1960), and we were friends for a long time. What I will miss most about him is his sense of humor. It was always fun to be with him.      You have to leave your country to get a perspective, to see what makes America great. Now I can say that nowhere in the world is there a match for what we have in Hollywood.      When you become a star, you don\'t change. Everyone else does.      [on Paths of Glory (1957)] A truly great film with a truly great theme: the insanity and brutality of war. As I predicted, it made no money.      [asked who his favorite director was] I would NEVER do that. I\'ve enjoyed working with Wilder, Wyler, Mankiewicz. Hawks, Kazan. I did three films with Minelli and got nominated for two of them - but I could never name just one director.      [2011, on Anne Hathaway] She\'s gorgeous! Wow! Where were you when I was making pictures?      [to ABILITY Magazine] You see, when a person becomes disabled, often their family starts thinking, ""Oh dear, don\'t move, let me get that for you"". Once I told my wife that I thought I wanted breakfast in bed the next morning, she said the old joke, ""If you want breakfast in bed, sleep in the kitchen.""      I can\'t tell you how many times someone has said, ""I\'ve heard you\'re such an S.O.B.I\'ll say, \'Who said that?\' Ninety percent of the time, it;s someone with whom I\'ve never worked.      [In his autobiography] I think that... I am unfairly given credit for Michael\'s talents, as if he had only my genes. Diana is a talented actress, and Michael has inherited from both of us. My wife and I see Diana and her husband, Bill Darrid, often... and have a pleasant relationship with them      Why is it that often the people you do the most for resent you the most? Maybe you remind them of their weaknesses. The hell with them!      I\'m too old to change. Like Popeye, ""I yam what I yam."" Love me or hate me, just don\'t be indifferent.      I\'ve never tried to win popularity contests. I\'ve always been blunt - never hesitated about expressing myself.      Let\'s face it - the world is a mess and he young people will inherit this mess. We should do all we can to help deal with it. That\'s why I wrote the book ""Let\'s Face It"" and dedicated to the young people. I try, with humor, to help them navigate through what lies ahead. But the reality is, he problems they face are not very funny.      We are the strongest country in the world. We are the richest. We must take self-inventory. We must look less into the stars and planets in the heavens and more into ourselves. What can we do to make our country better? To earn back the respect we used to have?      [The Mike Wallace Interview, 1957] Well then you don\'t understand what acting really is. And of course, that would be quite a long conversation to go into. I mean acting is an interpretive art. I mean you may hear Heifetz play the violin. He didn\'t write the piece, but oh, how he plays it. That\'s what\'s wonderful. That\'s what an actor tries to do. He may not have written the piece, but what he wants to do is interpret it.(In answer to MIke Wallace\'s statement; ""but you\'re reading somebody else\'s words. Somebody else is telling you what to do, where to go, how to stand, what to say."")      I often played the good cowboy on screen, riding in to save the day. Now, everybody thinks he is a cowboy too. That frightens me. We have become a cowboy country with too many guns. I cannot understand the people who are against some form of gun control. They should be the first to welcome a message on making it more difficult to get a gun. Many of them seem to propose more guns being available to everybody. Why? Are they interested in making more money for the gun manufacturers? Are they politicians who just want to oppose the president in anything he endorses? It\'s incomprehensible to me. (2013)      I never, ever thought I would live to be 100. That\'s shocked me, really. And it\'s sad, too. I miss Burt Lancaster - we fought a lot, and I miss him a lot. And John Wayne, even though he was a Republican and I was a Democrat.      I was not a tough guy. I just acted like one.      Michael didn\'t like me much after his mother and I got divorced. It was only when he started acting that we became close.      I don\'t know who any of the new stars are, and they probably don\'t know me.Salary (6)Out of the Past\xa0(1947)      $25,000       Champion\xa0(1949)      $15,000 + % of gross      20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\xa0(1954)      $175,000       Paths of Glory\xa0(1957)      $350,000       Last Train from Gun Hill\xa0(1959)      $325,000 against ten percent of the gross      In Harm\'s Way\xa0(1965)      $400,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nAnn-Margret ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 53 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(4)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(35)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(5)\xa0|Salary\xa0(3)  Overview (4)Date of Birth28\xa0April1941,\xa0Valsjöbyn, Jämtlands län, Sweden Birth NameAnn-Margret OlssonNicknameSlugger    Height5\'\xa03½""\xa0(1.61\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Actress and singer Ann-Margret is one of the most famous sex symbols and actresses of the 1960s and beyond. She continued her career through the following decades and into the 21st century.Ann-Margret was born Ann-Margret Olsson in Valsjöbyn, Jämtland County, Sweden, to Anna Regina (Aronsson) and Carl Gustav Olsson, who worked for an electrical company. She came to America at age 6. She studied at Northwestern University and left for Las Vegas to pursue a career as a singer. Ann-Margret was discovered by George Burns and soon afterward got both a record deal at RCA and a film contract at 20th Century Fox. In 1961, her single ""I Just Don\'t Understand"" charted in the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 Charts. Her acting debut followed the same year as Bette Davis\' daughter in Frank Capra\'s Pocketful of Miracles (1961). She appeared in the musical State Fair (1962) a year later before her breakthrough in 1963. With Bye Bye Birdie (1963) and Viva Las Vegas (1964) opposite Elvis Presley, she became a Top 10 Box Office star, teen idol and even Golden Globe nominated actress. She was marketed as Hollywood\'s hottest young star and in the years to come got awarded the infamous nickname ""sex kitten."" Her following pictures were sometimes ripped apart by critics (Bus Riley\'s Back in Town (1965) and The Swinger (1966)), sometimes praised (The Cincinnati Kid (1965)). She couldn\'t escape being typecast because of her great looks. By the late 1960s, her career stalled, and she turned to Italy for new projects. She returned and, by 1970, she was back in the public image with Hollywood films (R.P.M. (1970) opposite Anthony Quinn), Las Vegas sing-and-dance shows and her own television specials. She finally overcame her image with her Oscar-nominated turn in Mike Nichols\' Carnal Knowledge (1971) and succeeded in changing her image from sex kitten to respected actress. A near-fatal accident at a Lake Tahoe show in 1972 only momentarily stopped her career. She was again Oscar-nominated in 1975 for Tommy (1975), the rock opera film of the British rock band The Who. Her career continued with successful films throughout the late 1970s and into the 1980s. She starred next to Anthony Hopkins in Magic (1978) and appeared in pictures co-starring Walter Matthau, Gene Hackman, Glenda Jackson and Roy Scheider. She even appeared in a television remake of Tennessee Williams\'s masterpiece play ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" in 1983. Another late career highlight for her was Grumpy Old Men (1993) as the object of desire for Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. She continues to act in movies today.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Moonie          Spouse (1) Roger Smith (8 May\xa01967            - 4 June\xa02017)\xa0(his death)          Trade Mark (4)        Strawberry blonde hair        Sparkling green eyes        Voluptuous figure        Lisp, breathless voiceTrivia (35)      Chosen by Empire magazine as one of the 100 Sexiest Stars in film history (#10) (1995).      Survived a dramatic 22-foot fall from a stage in a Lake Tahoe, Nevada concert. She broke an arm, suffered five fractures of five facial bones including a smashed cheekbone, and a brain concussion. 10 weeks later to the day, she was back on stage in Las Vegas (1972).      Was a cheerleader at New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois. Other New Trier graduates include Ralph Bellamy, Charlton Heston, Rock Hudson, Hugh B. O\'Brien, Bruce Dern, Penelope Milford, Virginia Madsen and Liz Phair.      Attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois but did not graduate.      She formed a lifelong bond of friendship with Elvis Presley in their first pairing in Viva Las Vegas (1964). It was kept alive by Elvis\' habit of sending a bouquet of flowers to all of her stage-show appearances, until he died in 1977. She reveals her romance with Elvis in her autobiography.      On August 19, 2000, she suffered three broken ribs and a fractured shoulder when she was thrown off a motorcycle she was driving in rural Minnesota.      Discovered by actor/comedian George Burns when he heard her sing in a campus musical at Northwestern University and hired her to be a part of his Las Vegas act.

Rode a 500cc Triumph T100C Tiger motorcycle in The Swinger (1966) and the same model fitted with a non-standard electric starter in her stage show. A keen motorcyclist, she was featured in Triumph Motorcycles\' official commercials in the 1960s -- for obvious reasons.      During the Vietnam War, she toured with the USO to entertain U.S. troops in Vietnam and other parts of Southeast Asia. She still has great affection for the veterans and refers to them as ""my gentlemen"".      She had two Billboard Club Play charting hits: in 1979 with ""Love Rush"" which climbed to #8, and in 1980 with ""Midnight Message"" that peaked at #12.

The legendary hairdresser was also responsible for turning Lucille Ball into a redhead.      Both films for which she was Oscar nominated, Carnal Knowledge (1971) and Tommy (1975), also co-starred Jack Nicholson.      Wrote her autobiography when she heard that an unauthorized biography was in the works and wanted to beat the unauthorized biography to press.      Turned down the leading roles in Cat Ballou (1965) and Bonnie and Clyde (1967) for better-paying but lower-quality films.      She and George Burns (who discovered her) were both Oscar nominees in 1975 (respectively for Tommy (1975) and The Sunshine Boys (1975). Burns won but she did not.      Combining her previous work in Viva Las Vegas (1964) with Elvis Presley and guest starring on The Flintstones (1960) as Ann-Margrock, she sang the title song in the Flintstones live action movie prequel The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas (2000).      Almost married Burt Sugarman in 1962.      She became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1949 and took dance lessons at the Marjorie Young School of Dance, showing her natural ability from the beginning, easily mimicking all the steps.Paul Lynde played her father in Bye Bye Birdie (1963). He later appeared as a producer on an episode of I Dream of Jeannie (1965), and a character asks him what Ann-Margret is really like.      She was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6501 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on February 8, 1960.      In 2013, she experienced a resurge in popularity thanks to her most famous film being the center of attention during an episode of the television series Mad Men (2007).

I was a cartoon character. A joke.      I was very flattered by the sex-kitten thing because I never thought of myself as that.      [on Elvis Presley] He\'s an animal. Definitely an animal. A very interesting animal.      [1975] I like to be pushed. I\'ve been in 27 or 28 movies, and so many of the characters I played were cartoon characters, really. It\'s nice to play a three-dimensional person every once in a while for a change of pace.      [1975, on the hallucination scene in Tommy (1975) in which she cavorts in food] I knew when I read the script that that was going to be a rough scene to film, if we could do it at all. We shot \'Tommy\' during a period of three months, and the TV scene was the second to the last one we shot. Russell [director Ken Russell] needed all that time to prepare it.People ask me how we did it. It was done exactly the way it seems to have been done. Those were real soapsuds, and real baked beans, and that was real chocolate. After we got the chocolate smeared all over, we had to take a day off from shooting - we didn\'t work on Sundays - and you wouldn\'t believe what that set was like by Monday, with the chocolate under the hot lights.They only knew in theory how it would work; they\'d never tried it. What happened was that the room filled with suds - literally filled up. And I was rolling on the floor under the soap and I caught a piece of glass in my hand. Under liquid like that, you don\'t really feel the cut very much. I thought I\'d nicked something, and then I saw the suds turning pink. And the next thing I knew, I\'d had 23 stitches taken. That was bad enough, but as for the beans... To this day, I can\'t look a bean in the face.Salary (3)State Fair\xa0(1962)      $300 per week      Bye Bye Birdie\xa0(1963)      $35,000       Viva Las Vegas\xa0(1964)      $275,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nArnold Schwarzenegger ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 735 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(9)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(147)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(551)\xa0|Salary\xa0(22)  Overview (4)Date of Birth30\xa0July1947,\xa0Thal, Styria, Austria Birth NameArnold Alois SchwarzeneggerNicknamesArnieAustrian OakConan the RepublicanStyrian OakThe GovernatorThe Running ManConan the GovernorThe Machine    Height6\'\xa02""\xa0(1.88\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          With an almost unpronounceable surname and a thick Austrian accent, who would have ever believed that a brash, quick talking bodybuilder from a small European village would become one of Hollywood\'s biggest stars, marry into the prestigious Kennedy family, amass a fortune via shrewd investments and one day be the Governor of California!?The amazing story of megastar Arnold Schwarzenegger is a true ""rags to riches"" tale of a penniless immigrant making it in the land of opportunity, the United States of America. Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born July 30, 1947, in the town of Thal, Styria, Austria, to Aurelia (Jadrny) and Gustav Schwarzenegger, the local police chief. From a young age, he took a keen interest in physical fitness and bodybuilding, going on to compete in several minor contests in Europe. However, it was when he emigrated to the United States in 1968 at the tender age of 21 that his star began to rise.Up until the early 1970s, bodybuilding had been viewed as a rather oddball sport, or even a mis-understood ""freak show"" by the general public, however two entrepreneurial Canadian brothers Ben Weider and Joe Weider set about broadening the appeal of ""pumping iron"" and getting the sport respect, and what better poster boy could they have to lead the charge, then the incredible ""Austrian Oak"", Arnold Schwarzenegger. Over roughly the next decade, beginning in 1970, Schwarzenegger dominated the sport of competitive bodybuilding winning five Mr. Universe titles and seven Mr. Olympia titles and, with it, he made himself a major sports icon, he generated a new international audience for bodybuilding, gym memberships worldwide swelled by the tens of thousands and the Weider sports business empire flourished beyond belief and reached out to all corners of the globe. However, Schwarzenegger\'s horizons were bigger than just the landscape of bodybuilding and he debuted on screen as ""Arnold Strong"" in the low budget Hercules in New York (1970), then director Bob Rafelson cast Arnold in Stay Hungry (1976) alongside Jeff Bridges and Sally Field, for which Arnold won a Golden Globe Award for ""Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture"". The mesmerizing Pumping Iron (1977) covering the 1975 Mr Olympia contest in South Africa has since gone on to become one of the key sports documentaries of the 20th century, plus Arnold landed other acting roles in the comedy The Villain (1979) opposite Kirk Douglas, and he portrayed Mickey Hargitay in the well- received TV movie The Jayne Mansfield Story (1980).What Arnold really needed was a super hero / warrior style role in a lavish production that utilized his chiseled physique, and gave him room to show off his growing acting talents and quirky humor. Conan the Barbarian (1982) was just that role. Inspired by the Robert E. Howard short stories of the ""Hyborean Age"" and directed by gung ho director John Milius, and with a largely unknown cast, save Max von Sydow and James Earl Jones, ""Conan"" was a smash hit worldwide and an inferior, although still enjoyable sequel titled Conan the Destroyer (1984) quickly followed. If ""Conan"" was the kick start to Arnold\'s movie career, then his next role was to put the pedal to the floor and accelerate his star status into overdrive. Director James Cameron had until that time only previously directed one earlier feature film titled Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981), which stank of rotten fish from start to finish. However, Cameron had penned a fast paced, science fiction themed film script that called for an actor to play an unstoppable, ruthless predator - The Terminator (1984). Made on a relatively modest budget, the high voltage action / science fiction thriller The Terminator (1984) was incredibly successful worldwide, and began one of the most profitable film franchises in history. The dead pan phrase ""I\'ll be back"" quickly became part of popular culture across the globe. Schwarzenegger was in vogue with action movie fans, and the next few years were to see Arnold reap box office gold in roles portraying tough, no-nonsense individuals who used their fists, guns and witty one-liners to get the job done. The testosterone laden Commando (1985), Raw Deal (1986), Predator (1987), The Running Man (1987) and Red Heat (1988) were all box office hits and Arnold could seemingly could no wrong when it came to picking winning scripts. The tongue-in-cheek comedy Twins (1988) with co-star Danny DeVito was a smash and won Arnold new fans who saw a more comedic side to the muscle- bound actor once described by Australian author / TV host Clive James as ""a condom stuffed with walnuts"". The spectacular Total Recall (1990) and ""feel good"" Kindergarten Cop (1990) were both solid box office performers for Arnold, plus he was about to return to familiar territory with director James Cameron in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). The second time around for the futuristic robot, the production budget had grown from the initial film\'s $6.5 million to an alleged $100 million for the sequel, and it clearly showed as the stunning sequel bristled with amazing special effects, bone-crunching chases & stunt sequences, plus state of the art computer-generated imagery. Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) was arguably the zenith of Arnold\'s film career to date and he was voted ""International Star of the Decade"" by the National Association of Theatre Owners.Remarkably, his next film Last Action Hero (1993) brought Arnold back to Earth with a hard thud as the self-satirizing, but confusing plot line of a young boy entering into a mythical Hollywood action film confused movie fans even more and they stayed away in droves making the film an initial financial disaster. Arnold turned back to good friend, director James Cameron and the chemistry was definitely still there as the ""James Bond"" style spy thriller True Lies (1994) co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Arnold was the surprise hit of 1994! Following the broad audience appeal of True Lies (1994), Schwarzenegger decided to lean towards more family-themed entertainment with Junior (1994) and Jingle All the Way (1996), but he still found time to satisfy his hard-core fan base with Eraser (1996), as the chilling ""Mr. Freeze"" in Batman & Robin (1997) and battling dark forces in the supernatural action of End of Days (1999). The science fiction / conspiracy tale The 6th Day (2000) played to only mediocre fan interest, and Collateral Damage (2002) had its theatrical release held over for nearly a year after the tragic events of Sept 11th 2001, but it still only received a lukewarm reception.It was time again to resurrect Arnold\'s most successful franchise and, in 2003, Schwarzenegger pulled on the biker leathers for the third time for Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003). Unfortunately, directorial duties passed from James Cameron to Jonathan Mostow and the deletion of the character of ""Sarah Connor"" aka Linda Hamilton and a change in the actor playing ""John Connor"" - Nick Stahl took over from Edward Furlong - making the third entry in the ""Terminator"" series the weakest to date.Schwarzenegger married TV journalist Maria Shriver in April, 1986 and the couple have four children.In October of 2003 Schwarzenegger, running as a Republican, was elected Governor of California in a special recall election of then governor Gray Davis. The ""Governator,"" as Schwarzenegger came to be called, held the office until 2011. Upon leaving the Governor\'s mansion it was revealed that he had fathered a child with the family\'s live-in maid and Shriver filed for divorce.Schwarzenegger contributed cameo roles to The Rundown (2003), Around the World in 80 Days (2004) and The Kid & I (2005). Recently, he starred in The Expendables 2 (2012), The Last Stand (2013), Escape Plan (2013), The Expendables 3 (2014), and Terminator Genisys (2015).- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       David Montgomery < djmont@aol.com> and davesusanv@gmail.com          Spouse (1) Maria Shriver (26 April\xa01986            - present)\xa0(filed for divorce)\xa0(4 children)          Trade Mark (9)        Frequent movie line: ""I\'ll be back.""

His lawyer told the press he was seeking $20 million in damages, which is the amount he believes he would have received had he approved the use.

And the Terminator hardly has any lines!"" but Arnold asked him to ""trust me"".      8/6/03: Announced his candidacy for the Governorship of California on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992).

In Demolition Man (1993), Sandra Bullock\'s character Lenina Huxley is telling Sylvester Stallone\'s character John Spartan about the Arnold Schwarzenegger Presidential Library, explaining that, based on the sheer popularity of Schwarzenegger\'s movies, a Constitutional amendment was passed in order for Schwarzenegger to run for President, which, according to Huxley, he did. In 2003, ten years after this film\'s release, Schwarzenegger ran for the office of Governor of California, and won the election on 7 October 2003. While Schwarzenegger is not eligible to run for the presidency by present laws (as a naturalized citizen, not a native-born citizen as required by the Constitution), most past presidents have been governors of their respective home states. Some members of Congress are currently considering an amendment to the Constitution to allow foreign-born US citizens to be allowed to run for the Presidency, specifically with Schwarzenegger in mind, although other members of Congress are strongly opposed to the idea.

Ironically, Willis has a line in the film where he says that the terrorists ""have enough explosives to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger"".      TV Guide selected Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s announcement on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992) to run for Governor of California as the greatest TV moment of 2003.      Said that filming the climatic fight at the end of Predator (1987) was made difficult by the fact that the late Kevin Peter Hall, who played the Predator, couldn\'t see through his mask.      Has the record for winning the most major bodybuilding events in history, 13 (1 Mr. Junior Western Europe, 7 Mr. Olympias, and 5 Mr. Universes).      After he had started lifting weights as a teenager, he noticed that his body was becoming disproportionate. His arms, shoulders and chest were developing nicely, but his calves and lower legs weren\'t coming along as he wanted. To motivate himself to work harder on his calves, he cut off all of his pants (trousers) at the knee. Walking around like that, people would look at (and maybe even laugh at) the big man with \'chicken\' legs. It worked.      His father, Gustav Schwarzenegger, nicknamed him ""Cinderella"" as a child and his older brother, Meinhard, constantly picked on him growing up. Both men were killed while driving under the influence.      Only the second governor in California\'s history to be born in a foreign country.

Arnold\'s primary T800 character, however, survived, being ""upgraded"" to T1000 status).      Was considered for the role of the gentle giant Fezzik in the 1970s when William Goldman\'s book ""The Princess Bride"" was first proposed to be made into a film (The Princess Bride (1987)).

After achieving success as a bodybuilder, he indulged in drug abuse and womanizing, but he later rejected this and went on to become a vocal supporter of social causes, and was eventually elected governor of California.      Performed many of his own stunts in his films, owing largely to the fact that it was hard to find stunt doubles who matched his size. Billy D. Lucas, Joel Kramer and Peter Kent eventually became his personal stunt doubles and close friends.      His famous line ""I\'ll be back"", which originated from The Terminator (1984), was originally written as ""I\'ll come back"".      Initially refused to star in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) because James Cameron, who created the character and directed the first two films, would not be directing the third installment. Arnold tried to persuade Cameron to do the third film but Cameron declined and, feeling that the Terminator character was as much Arnold\'s as it was his own, Cameron advised Arnold to just do the third film and ask for a lot of money.      While filming the behind the scenes documentary for the special edition DVD of Conan the Barbarian (1982), the microphone hit him in the head at the end of the interview, to which he immediately joked ""You see, I can\'t even do an interview about Conan without getting hurt"".

Ironically, Jones had to temporarily get rid of his own Texas accent for said role.      While filming Predator (1987) he became close friends with co- star Jesse Ventura, who was also later elected a state governor (Minnesota).John Milius originally intended him to do the narration of Conan the Barbarian (1982) but the studio didn\'t trust his accent, so the narration was performed by Mako instead, who played the wizard.      Withdrew from the city of Graz the right to use his name in association with its soccer stadium and returned his ""Ehrenring"" (ring of honor) after some politicians in the town had started a campaign against Schwarzenegger due to his refusal to stop the execution of convicted killer Stanley Tookie Williams (20 December 2005).      The Green Party of Austria has resolved to strip Schwarzenegger of his Austrian citizenship due to his support for the death penalty.      12/12/05: As governor, he refused to grant clemency to convicted quadruple murderer and former gang leader Stanley Tookie Williams, who had been on Death Row for 24 years.      He was soundly defeated on all four propositions of his ""special election"", which cost the state of California an estimated $45 million.

He is the first member of the Kennedy family to become a state Governor.      12/23/06: Broke his right femur while skiing in Sun Valley, ID.      Although German is his native language, all his movies have been dubbed into German by Thomas Danneberg for the German-speaking market because his strong Austrian accent doesn\'t fit with the type of roles he plays.      He joined President George Bush in New Hampshire and asked voters to ""send a message to Pat Buchanan: Hasta la vista, baby"".

Schwarzenegger didn\'t know he fathered Baena\'s child until the child was a toddler and looked more and more like him. Joseph Baena was born only five days after Maria Shriver gave birth to her fourth child by Schwarzenegger, Christopher, therefore the children basically grew up alongside each other in the same home.

Was mentioned in the song ""Jump Around"" by House of Payne.      Quit Celebrity Apprentice after one season.Personal Quotes (551)      I was always interested in proportion and perfection. When I was 15 I took off my clothes and looked in the mirror. When I stared at myself naked, I realized that to be perfectly proportioned I would need 20-inch arms to match the rest of me.      [Interview in ""Starlog"" magazine in 1991, explaining his reluctance to do sequels to most of his successful films from the \'80s] There\'s so little time to do all the things I want to do that I can\'t see any reason to get bogged down in sequels.      Everything I have ever done in my life has always stayed. I\'ve just added to it . . . but I will not change. Because when you are successful and you change, you are an idiot.      I know that if you leave dishes in the sink, they get sticky and hard to wash the next day.      I would rather be Governor of California than own Austria.      I love the Hong Kong style of action movies, but that only looks good for small guys. The reason why the whole style was developed over there was because those guys were very puny guys - they\'re not powerful-looking guys, they\'re also not powerful guys. There\'s no weightlifting champion coming out of Hong Kong - maybe in the bantam division or the lightweight division or something like that, but normally you don\'t have really strong men coming out of there . . . they had to learn a technique that small people can do that are as effective as the big guy\'s strength. So that\'s where the martial arts came from.      In the beginning I was selfish. It was all about, ""How do I build Arnold? How can I win the most Mr. Universe and Mr. Olympic contests? How can I get into the movies and get into business?"" I was thinking about myself . . . As I\'ve grown up, got older, maybe wiser, I think your life is judged not by how much you have taken but by how much you give back.      [during his campaign for California governor, about his history of ""misbehavior""] Where I did make mistakes, or maybe go overboard sometimes . . . I regret that. This is a different Arnold.      [on his fight scenes with the female T-X in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)] How many times do you get away with this - to take a woman, grab her upside down and bury her face in a toilet bowl? The thing is you can do it, because, in the end, I didn\'t do it to a woman - she\'s a machine. We could get away with it without being crucified by who knows what group.      [on his decision to run for governor of California] It was the most difficult decision in my life - except the one in 1978 when I decided to get a bikini wax.      [after being pelted with an egg at a political rally] This guy owes me bacon now . . . you can\'t have egg without bacon.      [responding to criticism during a televised debate] I just realized I have the perfect part for you in ""Terminator 4.""      [victory speech after having won election as Governor of California] I will not fail, I will not disappoint you, I will not let you down.      The worst I can be is the same as everybody else. I hate that.      There\'s a lot of people who want me to get out of acting and want me to run for governor. I think it\'s mostly movie critics.      You have to remember something: Everybody pities the weak; jealousy you have to earn.      I took more abuse in Predator (1987) than I did in Conan the Barbarian (1982). I fell down that waterfall [40 feet] and swam in this ice-cold water for days and for weeks was covered in mud. It was freezing in the Mexican jungle. They had these heat lamps on all the time, but they were no good. If you stayed in front of the lamps, the mud dried. Then, you had to take it off and put new mud on again. It was a no-win situation. The location was tough. Never on flat ground. Always on a hill. We stood all day long on a hill, one leg down, one leg up. It was terrible.      [referring to Democrats at a political rally in Ontario, California, in 2004] If they don\'t have the guts to come up here in front of you and say, ""I don\'t want to represent you, I want to represent those special interests, the unions, the trial lawyers"" . . . if they don\'t have the guts, I call them girlie men.      [at the 2004 Republican National Convention] Speaking of acting, one of my movies was called True Lies (1994). It\'s what the Democrats should have called their convention.      President [George Bush] knows you can\'t reason with people that are blinded by hate. But let me tell you something: Their hate is no match for our decency, their hate is no match for the leadership and the resolve of George Bush.      [Talking about his Conan the Barbarian (1982) director]: John Milius used to call himself the dog trainer. Guess who were the dogs?      [From an interview about his reaction to reading the original The Terminator (1984) screenplay] I have read a lot of action adventure scripts, and this definitely was one of the best. I knew that I wanted to play the part of the Terminator as soon as I started reading.      [About being taken seriously] I don\'t care. The important thing to me is that I\'m doing work that people enjoy out there, that the movie makes good money, that the studio makes the money back, and that I\'m having a great time at what I\'m doing. I don\'t even consider myself serious. So how do I expect people to take me serious? I think this whole Hollywood thing has to be taken much looser . . . it\'s just entertainment.      ""There were various stepping-stones in my career. One of them was Conan the Barbarian (1982), because it was the first time I did a film with that kind of budget and I had the title role. The next big stepping-stone was The Terminator (1984). With ""The Terminator"", I think people became aware of the fact that I didn\'t really have to take my shirt off or run around and expose my muscles in order to sell tickets. After I did ""The Terminator"" and we had seen it be more successful than the Conan films, people then sent me a variety of different kinds of scripts - all in the action-adventure genre, but they were not muscle movies or Viking movies or pirate movies or anything like that.      [Talking about playing the Terminator] I had to act like a cyborg, which meant I couldn\'t show any kind of human fear or reaction to the fire, explosions, or gunfire that was going off around me. That can be difficult when you\'re walking through a door with its frame on fire, trying to reload a gun, and at the same time thinking in the back of your mind that people have accidents doing these kinds of stunts and that it might be my turn.      [About more sequels to The Terminator (1984)] I don\'t necessarily want to leave the magic of the Terminator movies behind, and who says we have to? According to what we know about the future, there were hundreds of Terminators built. The story of the Terminator could go on forever.      [From an interview expressing concern over making Conan the Destroyer (1984) less brutal than its predecessor, Conan the Barbarian (1982)] I think it\'s a mistake. I know Sylvester Stallone made an extra $20 million because he got a PG rating for Rocky III (1982), but it\'s a matter of how much you want to stay within the character\'s reality. Can you slaughter people and never see blood? Is it possible? You must have battles. That\'s part of life, war, and the world of Conan.      [Talking about director Richard Fleischer] The first day Fleischer came to see me work out, he told me, ""Arnold, could you put on some more muscles?"" I couldn\'t believe it! It turned out that Fleischer thought [John Milius\'] decision to keep Conan clothed throughout the first film was a mistake. Fleischer believes that people want to see my body much more often than they did the first time around, so they will. I spend most of my time in Conan the Destroyer (1984) fighting off people while I\'m dressed in a loincloth.      [About the dog accident while making Conan the Barbarian (1982)] One of them hit me too soon. It caught me off guard and I went right over the ledge. I fell ten feet and landed on my back. I was covered with scratches and bruises. It was probably a pretty good beginning for this movie, though. It set the tone for the whole time we were there. This was going to be fun . . . but dangerous.      [Talking about director John Milius] ""There never would have been a Conan movie without him.      [on Warren Beatty] There are some people who are close to him that say he is just starving for attention, and that\'s the way he gets attention. Other people said, ""Look, he\'s not working and he just feels like he should maybe get involved in politics"". Instead, I just think that maybe he is jealous that I did jump in. I find it silly, because I respect his work.      Well, I think because a lot of people don\'t know why I\'m a Republican, I came first of all from a socialistic country which is Austria and when I came over here in 1968 with the presidential elections coming up in November, I came over in October, I heard a lot of the press conferences from both of the candidates, [Hubert H. Humphrey] and [Richard Nixon], and Humphrey was talking about more government is the solution, protectionism, and everything he said about government involvement sounded to me more like Austrian socialism. Then when I heard Nixon talk about it, he said open up the borders, the consumers should be represented there ultimately and strengthen the military and get the government off our backs. I said to myself, ""What is this guy\'s party affiliation?"" I didn\'t know anything at that point. So I asked my friend, ""What is Nixon?"" He\'s a Republican. And I said, ""I am a Republican"". That\'s how I became a Republican.""      [on refusing to grant clemency to condemned killer Stanley Tookie Williams] After studying the evidence, searching the history, listening to the arguments and wrestling with the profound consequences, I could find no justification for granting clemency. The facts do not justify overturning the jury\'s verdict, or the decisions of the courts in this case.      [After undergoing heart surgery in 1997] We made, actually, history, because it was the first time ever that doctors could prove that a lifelong Republican has a heart.      As a kid - as a kid I saw socialist - the socialist country that Austria became after the Soviets left. Now don\'t misunderstand me: I love Austria and I love the Austrian people. But I always knew that America was the place for me. In school, when the teacher would talk about America, I would daydream about coming here. I would daydream about living here. I would sit there and watch for hours American movies, transfixed by my heroes, like John Wayne. Everything about America seemed so big to me, so open, so possible.      I have no sexual standards in my head that say this is good or this is bad. Homosexual - that only means to me that he enjoys sex with a man and I enjoy sex with a woman. It\'s all legitimate to me.      I didn\'t think about money. I thought about the fame, about just being the greatest. I was dreaming about being some dictator of a country or some savior like Jesus.      I\'m 6\'2"". I\'ve heard rumors that I\'m really much shorter in real life like 5\'6"" or something like that - which is ridiculous. I can assureyou this is not the case. People look up to me, and not just because I do a lot of work in the community. I mean, most people really look up to me.      California will not wait for our federal government to take strong action on global warming. We won\'t wait for the federal government. We will move forward because we know it\'s the right thing to do. We will lead on this issue and we will get other western states involved. I think there\'s not great leadership from the federal government when it comes to protecting the environment.      Money doesn\'t make you happy. I now have $50 million but I was just as happy when I had $48 million.      [in a 1987 interview] I have to give the audiences what they enjoy seeing while I try to bring in a little something new, with different movies, different time periods and all those things. But what\'s important is to entertain the people -- everything else means nothing.      [on his late friend and role model, body builder Reg Park]: Reg was a dear friend, an extraordinary mentor and a personal hero. Other than my parents, there may be no single person who had more to do with me becoming the person I am today than Reg. He was like a second father to me. It was Reg who impressed upon me how hard I would have to work if I wanted to achieve my dreams. I\'ll always remember him making me do calf-raises with 1,000 pounds at 5 o\'clock in the morning.      [on Terminator Salvation (2009)] I think it\'s cool to continue on with the franchise, in case I want to jump over again and get into the acting after I\'m through here (as Governor of California).      There are such high standards and now there are always new standards being set for action. You see that with Iron Man (2008) and with The Dark Knight (2008) and that other film this summer, um, Wanted (2008). That was an excellent movie! There was this train coming down from a bridge, falling, and they\'re fighting inside the train car. Jesus, that is unbelievable that you can do that. To have the imagination to write it and the talent to shoot it and make it real on the screen. It\'s a whole new dimension.      With Batman and Terminator, those big movies, there\'s a certain expectation and if you don\'t live up to it, if the movie is not a 10, then the business will be soft. If Terminator Salvation (2009) is pushing it forward, it will be breaking records all the time. If director McG has the T4 and the kind of shots that has the audience thinking, \'Now how did he do that?\' -- then it is \'Terminator\' and you can blow everyone away and every record at the box office.      [on Terminator Salvation (2009)] I hope they do well, and I hope it is a huge hit. I do hope it creates a spectacle on the screen. That is what James Cameron created.      [on watching Will Ferrell movies] In those you howl for two hours and you feel like you get a six-pack of ab muscles from all the laughs!      [on Terminator Salvation (2009)] I wasn\'t sure who the Terminator was. I don\'t know if there is one or if he\'s the star or the hero. These are the things that determine the success and how strong the movie will be.      I know California is supposed to be a place where dreams come true, but my life has gone way beyond the dream. My dream was to come to America, become the greatest bodybuilder of all time and do what Reg Park had done by going into Hercules movies. And if that worked out, I was going to build a gym business and then live happily ever after. Then all of a sudden I shot right by my dream. I stopped doing the strong man stuff, did the Terminator movies and became the highest-paid actor in Hollywood. I got $30 million for Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), you know.      [on the death of Michael Jackson] Michael was a pop phenomenon who never stopped pushing the envelope of creativity. Though there were serious questions about his personal life, Michael was undoubtedly a great entertainer and his popularity spanned generations and the globe.      [on the death of Patrick Swayze] Patrick Swayze was a talented and passionate artist who struck a memorable chord with audiences throughout the world. He played a wide range of characters both on stage and in movies and his celebrated performances made the hard work of acting look effortless - which I know from experience is not easy. As a fan and as an actor, I admired Patrick and I know that he will be dearly missed. On behalf of all Californians, Maria and I send our deepest condolences to Patrick\'s family, friends and fans.      I am here to spend. I love to spend Hollywood\'s money! (June 1993).      [on Sylvester Stallone in The Expendables (2010)] It is a great inspiration for people to see someone at his age still at the top of his game -- acting, writing, directing, doing his own stunts and fight scenes -- I mean, what an amazing talent. And for him to still be so athletic and be able to rip off his shirt and have a six-pack is just unbelievable.      [on the death of Tony Curtis] Tony Curtis was a Hollywood icon, a great performer and artist and devoted family man. I saw his extraordinary talent and ability to inspire generations of Americans firsthand on the set of Christmas in Connecticut (1992)\' and will always remember our times together.      [on a return to movies when his term as Governor of California ends] I have no idea. So it depends if someone comes with a great script or a great idea...you know, would I still have the patience to sit on the set and to do a movie for three months or six months? All of those things, I don\'t know, but I did have a meeting with James Cameron, we talked about some very important things.      The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive, but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer.      (On the power of visualizing your goals) When I was very young, I visualized myself being and having what it was that I wanted. The mind is really so incredible. Before I won my first Mr. Universe, I walked around the tournament like I owned it. The title was already mine. I had won it so many times in my mind that there was no doubt I would win it. Then, when I moved on to the movies, the same thing. I visualized myself being a successful actor and earning big money. I could feel and taste success. I just knew it would happen.      [on the passing of Elaine Kaufman] Elaine was an early supporter of my acting career and would often call to let me know when an influential writer or producer came in so I could stop and schmooze.      [on Terminator Salvation (2009)] The last one was awful. It tried hard, not that they didn\'t try, the acting and everything - it missed the boat.      [on visiting Venice, California] This place is insane. You never have to smoke a joint. You just go on a bicycle ride in the morning, inhale, and you live off everyone else.      [on Predator 2 (1990)] A predator in a city is a bad idea.      [on his career as a bodybuilder] I had a very clear vision of where I wanted to go. You realize you have to pay no attention to the naysayers. When you learn those lessons in sports, you can apply those lessons for the rest of your life.      [on his Governor\'s salary] I didn\'t take a penny of my salary during my terms. After all, it was petty cash compared to what you make in the movies.      You can\'t have a life full of successes. In bodybuilding, I tried bench-pressing 500lb many times and failed. That\'s how you get there. You have to be daring.      They\'re writing right now Terminator Genisys (2015). There have been some writers on it for the last year-and-a-half and they could not pull it off. We have told them over and over that they are going in the wrong direction, now they\'ve finally got rid of those writers and they\'ve got new really quality writers. Now they\'re going in the right direction. I think this year the script will be finished and we will be able to go into pre-production.      [on the death of his mentor Joe Weider] He advised me on my training, on my business ventures, and once, bizarrely, claimed I was a German Shakespearean actor to get me my first acting role in --Hercules in New York (1970) even though I barely spoke English. He was there for me constantly throughout my life, and I will miss him dearly.      [his father] A lot of sons would have been crippled by his demands, but instead the discipline rubbed off on me. I turned it into drive.      To this day, I\'m more comfortable when there\'s someone to schmooze with until I fall asleep.      When you grow up in a harsh environment, you never forget how to withstand physical punishment, even long after the hard times end.      If you wanted a girl, you had to make an effort to have a conversation, not just drool like a horny dog.      I associate glasses with intellectuals.      I came to America, won Mr. Universe, and now I\'m in the movies.      Most bodybuilders don\'t have very interesting insights or routines.      In America, unlike Europe, there weren\'t a million obstacles to starting a business.      After coming to California, I posed in the heights above Malibu. Bodybuilders like this spot because the ridges in the distance seem little and your muscles look bigger than the mountains.      The applause of a crowd made me stronger.      If you get muscles, you can go to the beach and pick up girls.      Americans love foreign names.      I wanted to be rich very quickly.      Monstrous, futuristic, what I envisioned America as all about.      Something that seems impossible at the start can be achieved.      [on sweat] It\'s a great way to lose body fat.      Nights without sleep don\'t mean you can\'t perform at a high level the next day and days without food don\'t mean you\'ll starve.      I aimed to be a leader someday.      If you let ego show through, you\'re put in your place.      [on journalists] They see everything from the outside.      Staying on top of the hill is harder than climbing it.      Its great to have someone to go home to.      When you have a relationship in a foreign language, you have to be extra careful not to miscommunicate.      I couldn\'t believe how difficult learning a new language could be. Pronunciations were especially dangerous.      [Mr. Universe, Mr. World and Mr. Olympia] Winning all three would be like unifying the heavyweight title in boxing: it would make me the undisputed world champion. Mr World was by far the biggest bodybuilding event I\'d ever seen.      In bodybuilding I was king of the mountain, but in everyday LA I was just another immigrant struggling to learn English and make a life. I was glad to be away living my own life.      I always saw myself as a citizen of the world.      The more popular bodybuilding grew in prisons, the more guys would get the message to behave.      Winning narrowly didn\'t make me feel good; I wanted my dominance to be clear.      [after his father had a stroke] It was painful and upsetting to see a man who had been so smart and so strong lose his coordination and his ability to think. He died not long after.      [his nephew Patrick] He became my pride and joy.      Real estate was the place to invest. The math of real estate really spoke to me.      I like to always wander in like a puppy.      Bodybuilders look in the mirror as they train. You need to be your own trainer.      If millions of people came to see my movies someday, it was important that they know where the muscles came from.      I wanted to promote bodybuilding, both so that more people would take part and to benefit my career. If I wanted to promote bodybuilding to a new audience, I\'d have to find my own way.      [on bodybuilding] It needed fresh blood.      I find joy in the gym because every rep and every set gets me one step closer to my goal.      I liked getting swept up into a cloud of celebs.      [on Jack Nicholson, \'Warren Beatty\', and Roman Polanski] They all had such enormous passion for their profession.      Having women in the gym made us train harder.      I had no idea that reading from a script means you\'re supposed to act out the role.      [personal motto] Presentation, presentation, presentation.      When somebody sets the bar so low, you can\'t go wrong.      [endorsing bodybuilding publicly] It was a boost for bodybuilding in America; suddenly the sport had a face and a personality.      In an entertainment interview, you could just make up stuff!      In bodybuilding, you try to suppress emotions and march forwards with determination; in acting its the opposite.      To live your life as an actor, you can\'t be afraid of someone stirring up your emotions.      Europe was always far less puritanical than the United States.      Sometimes its hard to explain to your toddler what you do at the office.      I\'ve been retired from bodybuilding since 1980 but I\'ll always stay involved.      [during his open-heart surgery] Maria (Shriver) put a brave face on a scary situation.      I get goosebumps when Nelson Mandela talks about inclusion, tolerance and forgiveness.      [on Maria Shriver] If I hadn\'t been her style and she hadn\'t been mine, we never would have ended up together. Maria meshed with everything that I was, what I stood for, and what I was doing. I got addicted to her. Maria was such a forceful personality that she would just run over guys. She wanted to be unique and different.      I was a self-made man.      In politics, when disputes arise and camps form, you have to grasp what\'s happening and move very quickly.      I could go on for hours about what draws me to Maria (Shriver) but still never fully explain the magic.      Love stories are built around people\'s idiosyncrasies.      [on Conan the Barbarian] There was no stunt double because it would have been difficult to find someone with a body like mine.      Dino (De Laurentiis) had a reputation for getting things done. He was very powerful in that way, and people in Hollywood knew it and didn\'t mess with him.      [on Conan the Barbarian (1982)] I\'d never done a love scene on camera and found it really strange.      My character and his stolen Harley were a perfect combo of cyborg and machine in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).      Our first major decision as a couple (he and Maria Shriver) was to find a house and call it our place.      When people come to me with a movie concept or a script, I always ask ""What is the poster? What is the image? What are we trying to sell here?""Danny DeVito is a master of comedy, loves stogies, and cooks pasta on the set-no wonder he made such a great twin.Ivan Reitman took a chance on me as a comic hero.Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis and I had great fun opening Planet Hollywood restaurants around the world.      Total anonymity is almost impossible in Hollywood.      The outside world looked at our relationship (he and Maria Shriver) in a simple-minded way, as a juicy success story. According to this way of thinking, Maria becomes part of my trophy collection.      [on Maria Shriver] She brought a great foundation of knowledge and was a great partner to work with because we both grew.      When you start out, its all about one to one contact.      I\'d always advanced by starting with a clear vision and working as hard as possible to achieve it.      For Maria (Shriver) to go out and be in front of the camera was a real declaration of independence.      [on Maria Shriver] She was the ideal woman for me.      Writing something is different from saying it.      I was Conan, and millions of dollars were being spent to make me shine. For the first time, I felt like the star.      [on Oprah Winfrey] She was talented and aggressive, and you could tell she believed in herself.      An aspect of being a Kennedy cousin (Maria Shriver) was that you were never completely free. Since there were so many cousins, the number of command performances were high.      Every one of the killings in Conan (the Barbarian) was well shot and extraordinary.      [on Conan the Barbarian (1982)] A Star Wars (1977) set on Earth.      (John) Milius always pushed the envelope. Conan (the Barbarian) has stunts that have since been outlawed from movies. The bloodshed in Conan seems tame by today\'s standards. At the time, the film introduced a whole new dimension of violence on screen. Actors had five quarts of blood strapped to their chests, the same amount in the human body. Whenever it was spilled, Milius shot it against a light background to get the full carnage.      I was really annoyed by the way that powerful studio executives kowtowed to the members of the ratings board.      I saw myself as a businessman first.      [on Ronald Reagan] He was wonderful at painting ideas in ways that everyone could understand.      My definition of living is to have excitement always; that\'s the difference between living and existing.      If you want to fight prejudice you have to have tolerance centers everywhere.      I was amazed to see how negative most of the people in Hollywood remained toward Reagan during his presidency. He represented the values that had brought me to America. The US was the greatest country with the best opportunities and now that it was my home, I wanted to keep it that way and make it even better. After the turmoil and gloom of the 1970s, Americans voted for Reagan because he reminded them of their strength.      [the outrageous and conservative sides to his personality] I wanted to feel comfortable in both worlds.      There has to be investment in the public good.      I\'d have made more money if Jimmy Carter still occupied the White House.      You do a movie or a book, you promote the hell out of it, you travel the world as if its your marketplace, and in the meantime, you work out and take care of business and explore even more.      When I learned about The Terminator (1984), I loved the idea that he was a machine that never had to sleep.      For me, the question was always how to fit in all the stuff I want to do. I seldom saw my life as hectic, the thought rarely crossed my mind.      I\'m not a religious person.      I never like to cut things from my life; I only add.      I\'d felt like an American from the time I was 10 years old.      [his first thought when he met James Cameron] A skinny, intense guy.      I never went to a competition to compete; I went to win.      I wasn\'t sure I was free from prejudice; I\'d made prejudiced comments.      When you promote a movie, you want to win over everybody. If you give political speeches, you are bound to turn off somebody.      I considered the US my permanent home.      I kept quiet about politics whenever I visited Austria. I never wanted to be perceived as some wise guy coming back and telling people what to do.      I always believed in shooting for the top, and to become an American is like becoming a member of the winning team.      [his first thought about The Terminator (1984)] Strange name.      Poses are the snapshots, and the routine is the movie.      Bodybuilding is a lot like politics; you go from town to town, hoping word will spread.      [on bodybuilding competitions] You can\'t just pose on stage like a robot and then walk off; people will never get to know your personality.      At the top of the ladder, there was always room for one more. The more people who stay on the bottom, the more crowded it becomes.      If I can see it and believe it, then I can achieve it.      [on James Cameron] He seemed more real than the people I met from Hollywood.      [on The Terminator (1984)] No thinking, no blinking, no thought, just action.      [on restaurants] In Hollywood, the actor never pays.      Once I\'ve locked in on a vision for myself, I always resist changing the plan.      I\'m a big believer in hard work, grinding it out, and not stopping until it\'s done.      [on James Cameron] The women he married, although a long list, were women you didn\'t want to mess with.      I never left the house without $1000 in cash and a no-limit credit card.      The conventional wisdom in Hollywood is that playing a villain is career suicide.      I think more like a businessman than like a typical actor.      Compared to Conan the Barbarian (1982), Conan the Destroyer (1984) was a trip to Club Med.      [on James Cameron] A control freak, he has eyes in the back of his head. He knows the name of everyone on the set and no screwup gets past him; if you screw up he\'ll make a scene publicly and embarrass you.      I always think the world of people who make a project their own and are on it 24 hours a day.      [the Golden Raspberry Awards] A kind of Oscar in reverse for bad movies.      You should marry when you\'re set financially and the toughest struggles of your career are behind you. Most marriages break up over financial issues.      I wasn\'t marrying her (Maria Shriver) because she came from wealth. What was Maria\'s was hers.      [Maria Shriver\'s portrait in his art collection] Among these beautiful images, Maria\'s was the gem.      [on Jacqueline Kennedy] She had an amazing ability to ask questions that would make you wonder ""how did she know that""? She always made people feel welcome.      Gitte (Brigitte Nielsen) had a personality filled with laughter and fun mixed with a great hunger for attention.      When you make a movie, you can never really predict what will turn out to be the most repeated line.      [on The Terminator] The American public accepted me as both a hero and a villain.      In the mind of the public, the star is responsible for a movie\'s success.      [on marriage] Just let me stumble into it; I don\'t want to be forewarned.      You can over-think anything. There are always negatives. The more you know, the less you tend to do something.      [on marriage] I might not have done it if I\'d known everything I\'d have to go through.      I\'m always comparing life to a climb, not just because there\'s a struggle but also because I find at least as much joy in the climbing as in reaching the top. I pictured marriage as a whole mountain range of fantastic challenges.      [on Grace Jones] An interesting non-actor; talented and entertaining, she could not do anything low-key.      Have at least ten good laughs a day.      The makeup trailer is the place on the set where everyone talks. If anybody\'s worried about anything, that\'s where you see it. It\'s the mother of all beauty salons. The makeup trailer is all about a soothing atmosphere, because you\'re getting ready for a scene.      Actresses have more problems than the average housewife.      [on his wedding day] I loved watching Maria (Shriver) coming up the aisle. She looked so regal but at the same time, she radiated warmth and happiness.      I was riding the great wave of action movies. They became as important to the 1980s as Westerns were in the 1950s.      Action movies are always more of an ordeal than a pleasure to make.      [on John McTiernan] If a director of his caliber had done the sequel to Predator (1987), the movie could have become a major franchise on a par with The Terminator (1984) or Die Hard (1988).      It\'s always easy to be smart in hindsight.      Stallone and I were the leading forces in the genre. We created work for up and coming action stars like Chuck Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren and Bruce Willis. Clint Eastwood began to show more muscle as a result. The body was key. The era had arrived where muscular men were viewed as attractive. Looking physically heroic had become the aesthetic.      Early in my movie career, the hardest thing was giving up control. In bodybuilding, everything had been up to me. In movies, you depend on others right from the start.      [on the opening scene] You have one idea and then sit down and cook up the rest.      Whenever I finished filming a movie, my job was only half done. Every film had to be nurtured in the marketplace. Some of the greatest artists never sold much because they didn\'t know how. No matter what I did in life, I was aware that you had to sell it.      Listening made me a more effective promoter. You have to cultivate your audience and expand it with each new film. Nurturing a movie means paying attention to the distributors. You do the things they feel are important because they go all out in pushing the theatres.      When I had a good director, my movies went through the roof because I was directed well. If I had a director who was confused with no compelling vision for the movie, it would fizzle. I didn\'t make The Terminator the success that it was; it was James Cameron\'s vision that made the movie great.      Everything in life has a funny side. I\'d always been the perfect target for jokes; there was so much material to work from.      Meeting comedians helped me to understand comedy. I really liked being around people who are funny.      [on Total Recall (1990)] Working with Sharon Stone will always be a challenge. She was a sweetie off the set but needed tons of attention on-set. There are just some actors who need more attention. People just have their hang-ups and insecurities and acting definitely brings that out.      In acting you take criticism so much more personally. You get upset, but every job has its downside.      [on Paul Verhoeven and Total Recall (1990)] So many things he said were brilliant. He had a masterful vision. He had enthusiasm, and did a great job. I was proud my interest and passion helped to bring about the movie. But the experience also proves how important marketing is - how important it is to tell the people what this is about; really blow up their skirt and make them say, ""I have to go see this movie.""      A Special Achievement Oscar is how the Motion Picture Academy honors an accomplishment for which there is no set category.      I grew up in a culture where you respect the elders.      When I see a great performer, I always start to dream. Maybe its the Leo in me, the perpetual performer who always wants to be the center of attention.      Starting with something disarming and funny is a good way to stand out. You become more likable, and people receive your information much better. Whenever I watched a comedy, I always thought ""I could have done that!"" But if I was going to branch into comedies, I would need someone to be my cheerleader.      [on Total Recall (1990)] For me, it connected with the sense I had sometimes that my life was too good to be true.      It wouldn\'t matter if you watched Total Recall (1990) 20 years from now, you could still enjoy it. There\'s just something very appealing about futuristic movies if they have great action and believable characters.      A change in studio management can sink a movie.      Once you pick a director, you have to have total faith in him and go with his judgment.      [on The Running Man (1987)] It was totally screwed up by hiring a first-time director and not giving him time to prepare.      [his first impression of Paul Verhoeven on Total Recall (1990)] A skinny, intense-looking Dutch guy.      Every director wants to pee on the script and make his mark.      [on Danny DeVito] He\'s the opposite of a crazy Hollywood personality and the Milton Berle of comic acting.      Compared to an action hero, it was easier being a comic star.      [his singing ability] I\'m no Frank Sinatra. The only time I sing in real life is at the end of a party when I want the guests to leave.      [on George Bush] He had tremendous strength of character and will. This was our next President, the real American hero. He had a casual approach to campaigning; not everything had to be perfect.      I belonged to the NRA because I believed in the constitutional right to bear arms.      I am a patriotic American. I saw Ronald Reagan and George Bush take an economy that looked like Pee-wee Herman and make it look like Superman.      Eisenhower and Kennedy championed fitness as a way for America to stand strong against the Soviets.      Fitness is important for all Americans, not just athletes. A lot of schools have great athletic programs but not great fitness programs.      I\'d never seen a director fine-tune a movie as methodically as Ivan Reitman.      I was on a crusade around the world to promote health and fitness to young people.      Governments don\'t want to be told they\'re doing something wrong.      I\'d always felt we lacked real men in movies.      [when his first child was born] Fuck! This is my first baby. You can be so overwhelmed by something that billions of people in history have done. And from that moment on, your life as a couple has changed. But as long as you love the baby, you\'ll figure it out, just like with everything you love doing. Caring for babies is hardwired into the brain.      I was addicted to public service.      Humour was what made me stand out from other action leads. It opened up the (action) movie and made it appealing to more people.      [on The Terminator (1984), Commando (1985), Predator (1987) and Total Recall (1990)] They all focused on the universal theme of good vs evil.      If the press sees you coming out of the Oval Office with the President, you\'ll win respect.      Fitness is fun. I felt very strongly that I had to carry to all 50 states the message that fitness was a national priority.      I love being on the road and meeting people. That\'s what I do best.      The Great American Workout was from 7 to 9 o\'clock in the morning.      When in Austria, I often put on traditional clothes and do as the Austrians do.      Hiking in the Alps I\'d sometimes wear loud obnoxious Hawaiian shorts just to get a rise out of the Lederhosen traditionalists.      [on James Cameron] [He] is a big believer in surprising the audience. His knowledge of science and the world of the future went way beyond the ordinary.      [on Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)] It was typical James Cameron genius to have character development in a machine.      My friendship with the President (George Bush Sr) quickly became a very big part of my life. It was warm from the time we first met during the Reagan years.      [on the Gulfstream III jet] The perfect vehicle for visiting the States.      After being the fitness czar, running for Governor of California felt like deja vu.      My talent is fitness and this is something I can give back.      You can\'t have people just like your movie, you need them to be passionate. Word of mouth is what makes movies big, because while you can put in millions to promote the movie on the first weekend, you can\'t afford to do that every week.      Its embarrassing to fail at the box office.      When you feel embarrassed, you assume the whole world is focused on your failure.      [on George Bush] If you had talent and did him a favour or he liked you, he would push you forward whether it made sense or not. He was a different breed, a sweetheart of a guy. The fact he put such trust in me had a powerful effect. I felt there would never, ever be a time, no matter what happened, when I would violate that trust or let the man down.      A person\'s muscles don\'t care where the resistance comes from.      America wouldn\'t be the land of the free if it wasn\'t the home of the brave. When you see the work they do and the risks they take, you realize what we owe our military.      1991 was golden for me.      [on Planet Hollywood] A glitzy new moneymaking machine. It was not just an event; it was the beginning of an empire.      I came to America because it\'s the greatest place in the world, and I\'m going to do everything I can to keep it the greatest place.      I\'ve always felt appreciative of the armed forces because I\'ve benefited from the American dream, and their courage and determination is what safeguards it.      [during Conan the Destroyer (1984)] I\'m finally getting paid a million dollars for a movie, but now Sylvester Stallone\'s making 3 million, I feel like I\'m standing still.      If I heard an idea or saw a script that was exceptionally good and triggered something in me, I wanted to make that movie.      I loved the idea of new challenges, along with new dangers of failure.      Clint (Eastwood) was one of the few Hollywood personalities who had his head screwed on straight.      (Richard) Nixon was very good at paying attention to you. We need more leaders like him.      Nobody in Hollywood wins all the time. At some point, you\'re bound to get a beating.      America can be powerful only if you have a strong military.      I figured that the idea of eventually ending up in politics was not that far fetched when someone like (Richard) Nixon suggested it.      I love factories, and whenever I\'m passionate about a product, I want to see it being made.      Cubans are geniuses. They have the best climate, they have the best soil, and they have the tradition: generations of people who are passionate about rolling cigars and who are always looking for ways to make the cigars ever more perfect. When you look at a cigar and it has those thick veins in it, it\'s either a cheaper cigar or someone wasn\'t paying attention. As with everything, it\'s important to have a great-looking label. Cuban cigars truly are as good as people say. You can sniff out the fakes ones within seconds.      I always like to be called up for a speech without any prior notice.      No-one expects you to blow people up in a comedy.      When you feel good about someone and you know specifically why, it\'s not difficult at all to speak from the heart.      I\'m like a little kid who loves to show off and share things that I have experienced.      I thought I was the poster boy for the American dream. I came to the US virtually broke, worked hard, kept focused on my goal, and made it. This really was the land of opportunity. If a kid like me could do it, anybody could. I had a fire inside of me to succeed. Anything is possible, but you have to do your end of the work. Making money was never my only goal, but money opened the door to interesting investments.      In the mid-1990s the Internet was just an odd new idea.      The most important thing was not how much you make, but how much you invest, how much you keep. I never wanted to join the long list of famous entertainers and athletes who wiped out financially. My goal was to get rich and stay rich.      I never like business relationships that are purely work.      [his personal motto] Take one dollar and turn it into two.      I wanted big investments that were interesting, creative and different. Conservative bets didn\'t interest me. I was proud to pay taxes on the money I earned. I could tolerate big risks in exchange for big returns, but I\'m always open to new ideas.      Singapore Airlines had the best reputation in the airline business. The Boeing 747 was the ballsiest airliner.Stan Winston\'s special effects studio was torture; on The Terminator, it took 30 minutes for the cement to dry when designing the prosthetics to cover my face. The first time I went through it I got very anxious and thought of pleasant memories to endure it. My heart surgery reminded me of all that.      The more you promote yourself as the ultimate action hero, the more people form a larger than life perception of you.      [after heart surgery] I felt as vigorous as Hercules.      Planet Hollywood opened in Moscow, Sydney, Helsinki, London, San Antonio Texas (drawing 100,000 spectators) and Paris. Planet Hollywood was like The Beatles.      Sometimes when you look at a deal, you see less danger and you\'re too willing to take the plunge. The more risky things are, the more upside there is.      I\'d hear guys bragging about their new Gulfstream IV or IV-SP and I\'d get to say, ""That\'s great guys. Let me talk about my 747..."" It was a great conversation stopper.      God is the one who made the science possible.      [on heart surgery] Big risk, big reward.      [on Maria Shriver] She had a tendency to blow things up into high drama, even things that weren\'t life and death, whereas I would play everything down. I\'m a person who does not like to talk about things over and over. I make quick decisions, I don\'t ask opinions, and I don\'t think over the same things. I want to move on. She\'s an outward processor, while I keep things bottled up.      There\'s a moment going into surgery that I really hate. The moment when the anesthesia takes hold, when you know you\'re going out, losing consciousness and don\'t know if you\'ll ever wake up from it.      [after heart surgery] I got a second or third lease on life.      on [Planet Hollywood] I\'d love to do it again, only to have it managed better. Whoopi (Goldberg), Bruce (Willis), Sly (Stallone) and all the other big-name participants would tell you that Planet Hollywood was fun. With the huge parties, openings, premieres, we met people all over the world and had the time of our lives.      She (Maria Shriver) is a very good writer, with an unbelievable vocabulary and grace with words.      Holidays become more meaningful when you have a family.      Talking to kids in your second language is never easy to do.      After I came to America, I learned to think a bit more about my family rather than just myself. With my mother I built a good relationship where she and I really communicated. I loved doing things for my mother. She deserved to be treated like a queen. She was buried next to my father because they were so connected.      You\'re just one person, and the country is much bigger, and it\'s what will live forever.      Big-time celebrities don\'t like flying commercial.      Promotion and merchandising were realms I truly understood.      [on California] America\'s golden state.      America is my true home.      I wasn\'t interested in symbols. I was interested in action.      Big cats have always fascinated me.      Independent producers are the saviours in Hollywood because they\'ll take risks that the big studios won\'t.      I love shooting at night because I have a lot of energy at night and I get lots of inspiration.      [on heart surgery] It gave me energy beyond belief. I feel like a totally new person. And I no longer had to convince people that I still had a pulse.      [on being governor] He can bring a vision to the state; you get blamed for everything and you get credit for everything. It\'s high risk, high reward. I felt tremendous loyalty and pride about California. I wanted America to stay the bastion of free enterprise and protect it from following Europe in the direction of bureaucracy and stagnation. You make a big mistake to lock in programs that require you to keep spending at boom-time levels.      The more I read up on California, the more it was like bad news piled on top of bad news. We can\'t continue this way. We need change.      I was fiscally conservative, pro-business, against raising taxes, pro-choice, pro-gay, pro-lesbian, pro-environment, pro-reasonable gun control, pro-reasonable social safety net.      We needed to avoid trying to win over the press and instead play to the people. I was all about leadership and major projects and reforms that could attract massive public support.      I pride myself on being able to juggle many tasks. I got a college education while bodybuilding, married Maria (Shriver) in the middle of filming Predator, and made Kindergarten Cop and Terminator 2 while launching Planet Hollywood.      Most juvenile crime is committed between 3 and 6 o\'clock in the afternoon.      I would not go into a competition with a disadvantage.      If you don\'t get killed, you win.      I thought I would never die.      [winning the title of Mr Universe] It is my lifetime realized. I am very happy to be Mr Universe. I say it again, it sounds so good. I am very happy to be Mr Universe. My thanks to everyone in England who have helped me. They have been very kind to me. Thank you all.      Los Angeles stood out because it was the only big city that had after-school programs in every one of its 90 elementary schools. State officials and lawmakers just didn\'t see after-school programs as important. After-school programs not only help the kids but also reduce the strain on the teachers. Young kids relate better to young people, especially after a whole day of teachers and school. They want counsellors in jeans and with spiky hair, who can serve as parent figures but who don\'t look like them - not that many retired teachers want to go back to work.      The reason I wanted to be healthy was that I never wanted to ask anyone for money. It was so against my grain.      Raising cash from the set of a movie was a huge advantage.      I had a track record of organizing summits across fifty states. I loved seeing wounded veterans and entertaining them and thanking them for their great work.      I\'d assumed that a recall would be just like a normal election.      I never argued with people who underestimated me. If the accent and the muscles and the movies made people think I was stupid, it worked to my advantage.      Our elected leaders will either act decisively, or we will act in their place.      [governorship] I would give up my movie career for that.      Californians love their cars.      Spend no more than the state is taking in.      Its hard for any governor to make the changes that were needed. I loved it when people say that something can\'t be done. That\'s when I really get motivated; I like to prove them wrong. And I liked the idea of working on something bigger than me.      [California] It is the place in the world where everyone wants to go. It was wrapped in problems, but it was also heaven.      There is a disconnect between the people of California and the politicians of California. We the people are doing our job: work hard, pay taxes, raise our families. The politicians are not doing their job. They fiddle, they fumble, and they fail. These words resonated more strongly than any movie script I\'d read.      [Baghdad] The wild driving, the poverty, no money and a leadership vacuum - like California right now.      I was not the least bit intimidated by the thought of a campaign. It was like every other major decision I\'d faced. I thought about winning. I knew it would happen. I was locked in automatic pilot.      As every spouse knows, you have to pick the right moment to bring up a loaded subject.      When I came here, California was a beacon.      [why he wanted to become governor of California] I\'m tired of this acting stuff. I need a new challenge.      In politics everybody knows everything. You\'re totally exposed.      When I met Maria [Shriver], she was full of life, excitement, and hunger for the world. She wanted to be a rebel, not have a job on Capitol Hill.      Whatever she [Maria Shriver] wanted to do, I would help her get there.      One side of Maria [Shriver] was ballsy and brave and wanted to be a strong partner.      Making a career decision had always been an incredible high. Making a career decision as a husband and a father was a whole different deal.      Declaring a candidacy was so loaded.      California is more important than everyone\'s career.      Is firefighting a macho enough profession for an action hero? The real life heroism at Ground Zero laid that question to rest.      Elected officials usually hate ballot initiatives because they reduce their power and make the state harder to govern.      Republicans and unions usually don\'t mix.      I wanted to know what it really took to run for office, given that I wasn\'t a typical candidate.      I remember marvelling at how ordinary citizens could limit the state\'s power.      I took pride in my financial independence.      Leave no stone unturned.      I always paid close attention to focus groups and surveys and in politics, opinion research plays an even bigger role.      [being governor of California] This was the best job I ever had.      There is no contradiction in being both a Republican and an environmentalist      For me, talking convincingly about the future was easy: all I had to do was point to what we\'d achieved since I came into office.      California politics was this big centrifuge that forced voters, policies and parties away from the center. I challenged Californians to stop yielding to the far left and the far right and return to the center. Centrist does not mean weak, or watered down or warmed over. It means well balanced and well grounded. The American people are instinctively centrist. So should be our government. America\'s political parties should return to the center, where the people are. The left and the right don\'t have a monopoly on conscience.      We are not waiting for politics, for our problems to get worse, or for the federal government. Because the future does not wait. Not only can we lead California into the future, we can show the nation and the world how to get there.      [politics] You get so immersed in the job there are side effects on the people you love. Even if you succeed in protecting your wife and kids from the public spotlight, they feel they\'re sharing and losing you.      Trying to reform health care had almost destroyed Bill Clinton\'s presidency. I\'d always thought it was a disgrace that the greatest country in the world didn\'t provide a health care system for all of its people, as many European countries do. Our health care reform became America\'s, and California led the way.      All the great ideas come from local governments.      I am of the Reagan view that we should not go off the cliff with flags flying.      The California Republican Party should be a right of center party that occupies the broad middle of California.      Even when acting in a movie, I would not shoot a stunt if I hadn\'t rehearsed it a minimum of ten times.      President Bush (Jr) was always available to talk. If I raised only one issue at a time, I would get a fair hearing.      If you need to do something that\'s not in the manual, throw the manual out.      Never bullshit.      The statistics in the wake of a disaster are always tragic.      When the federal government meddles in markets, the states pay the price.      When you\'re spending more money than you\'re taking in, you cut spending. Simple.      Ad-libbing can backfire when you\'re running for governor.      I\'m not really the crying type.      It\'s painful to have just endorsed things that you now have no money for. I felt like a schmuck backing out on commitments I wanted to make but could no longer afford. The consequences of cuts are not just dollars, but people. We\'re all getting screwed. I was forced to make unpopular decisions that nobody, least of all me, was happy about.      [on his children] The drama of the presidential election interested them more than my job.      I believe in sprinting through to the finish line.      All great movements in history start out on a grassroots level, not in places like Washington or Paris or Moscow or Beijing.      I\'m proud to say I found a way to cram 36 hours of work into a single day.      Budget negotiations are no different than grueling five hour weight lifting sessions in the gym. The joy of working out is that with each painful rep you get a step closer to achieving your goal. I was deeply frustrated with party leaders and the press for not making plain the budget history.      When I stepped up to the podium, I was overwhelmed to realize I was standing where John F. Kennedy, Nelson Mandela and Mikhail Gorbachev had all addressed the UN before me.      Unlike regular politicians, I had nothing to lose.      Six years of ups and downs forged me as a governor. I had more forward momentum than ever before. I felt more like a hungry eagle rather than a lame duck.      The key to real permanent reform is being in sync with the hearts and minds of the people. We had rattled so many cages on the left and the right with our reforms.      Of all the things I\'ve done with my life, nothing is seared in my memory more than looking into the eyes of someone who has just lost everything he loved in the world.      Being governor was more complex and challenging than I had imagined. That\'s the problem of presenting yourself as the Governator. You can do miracles but not the kind that require wearing a cape and being able to fly. As governor, you\'re neither a solitary champion nor a star. Compared to making a movie, when you accomplish something in government, the satisfaction is so much larger and long lasting. In a movie, you are entertaining people for a few hours in a dark theatre. In government, you are affecting entire lives; generations even.      Change takes big balls.      I\'ve always idolized (Mikhail) Gorbachev because of the courage it took to dismantle the political system that he grew up under. For Gorbachev to have the guts to embrace change rather than further oppress his people or pick fights with the West has always amazed me.      Fitness promotes health and enhances the quality of life.      [lying to Maria Shriver about his infidelity] Instead of doing the right thing, I\'d just put the truth in a mental compartment and locked it up where I didn\'t deal with it every day.      [on his illegitimate son] Politically, I didn\'t feel it was anybody\'s business because I hadn\'t campaigned on family values. If I was going to talk about bad behavior, I wanted to do it on my own timetable.      Although Maria (Shriver) and I remain separated, I still try to treat everyone as if we are together. Maria has a right to be bitterly disappointed and never look at me the same way again.      What had made my career fun for more than 30 years was sharing it with Maria (Shriver). We\'d done everything together and now there was no one to come home to.      A green global economy is desirable, necessary, and within reach.      You start reading scripts and visualizing the scene and how to direct it, how to choreograph the stunt, and then you get into it and then you look forward to doing it.      Normally an action star keeps to himself on the set.      There\'s a difference between being 35 and almost 65.      [University of Southern California] It prides itself on being neither conservative nor liberal but open minded. It operates by promoting discussion to draw the best ideas from the brightest minds across the political spectrum.      The great leaders always talk about things that are much bigger than themselves. They say working for a cause that will outlive us is what brings meaning and joy. The more I\'m able to accomplish in the world, the more I agree.      I always wanted to be an inspiration for people, but I never set out to be a role model in everything. It\'s never been my goal to set an example in everything I do.      I don\'t believe that violence on-screen creates violence on the street or in the home. Otherwise there would have been no murders before movies were invented, and the Bible is full of them.      I prefer being way out there, shocking people. Rebelliousness is part of what drove me from Austria. Being outrageous is a way to succeed. No one could put me in a mold. Being different was right up my alley.      Life is richer when we embrace the multitudes we all contain.      Impossible was a word I loved to ignore when I was governor. The only way to make the possible possible is to try the impossible. If you fail, so what? That\'s what everybody expects. But if you succeed, you make the world a much better place.      Never follow the crowd. Go where it\'s empty. It\'s easier to stand out when you aim straight for the top.      No matter what you do in life, selling is part of it.      You can do the finest work and if people don\'t know, you have nothing! The most important thing is to make people aware.      [on Muhammad Ali] I always admired him because he was a champion, had a great personality, and he was generous and always thoughtful toward others. If all athletes could be like him, the world would be better off.      Don\'t overthink. If you think all the time, the mind cannot relax. Part of us needs to go through life instinctively. Turning off your mind is an art. Knowledge is extremely important for making decisions. The more knowledge you have, the more you\'re free to rely on your instincts. The more you know, the more you hesitate. When you are not confident of your decision-making process, it will slow you down. Overthinking is why people can\'t sleep at night: it cripples you.      Many movie deals are made under pressure, and if you freeze, you lose.      To test yourself and grow, you have to operate without a safety net. Forget Plan B. If there is no Plan B, then Plan A has to work.      You can use outrageous humour to settle a score.      What are the odds for an Austrian farm boy to come to America and become the greatest bodybuilding champion of all time, to get in the movie business, marry a Kennedy, and then get elected governor of the biggest state in the United States?      If government is not taking in enough revenue because of an economic slowdown, then everyone should chip in and sacrifice.      Writing out my goals became second nature, and so did the conviction that there are no shortcuts. It took hundreds and even thousands of repetitions for me to learn to hit a great three-quarter back pose, deliver a punchline, dance the tango in True Lies (1994), paint a beautiful birthday card, and say ""I\'ll be back"" just the right way.      I have come to feel great affection for the peoples of the world, because they have always been so welcoming to me, whether as a bodybuilder, a movie star, a private citizen, or as governor of the great state of California.      Don\'t blame your parents. They\'ve done their best for you, and if they\'ve left you with problems, those problems are now yours to solve. I could channel my upbringing in a positive way rather than complain. I could use it to have a vision, set goals, find joy. I don\'t have to lick my wounds. Sometimes you have to appreciate the very people and circumstances that traumatized you. Today I hail the strictness of my upbringing, and the fact I didn\'t have anything I wanted in Austria, because those were the very factors that made me hungry; it put fuel on the fire in my belly. It drove and motivated me.      There are a thousand keys to success.      [on his infidelity] It was one of those stupid things that I promised myself never to do. A lot of people, no matter how successful or unsuccessful in life, make stupid choices involving sex.      Secrecy is just part of me. I keep things to myself no matter what. I\'m not a person who was brought up to talk.      Bodybuilders who are blind to themselves or deaf to others usually fall behind.      [on Mr. Universe] I wanted to win it so decisively that people would forget I\'d ever lost.      Take care of your body and your mind. Focusing on the body was no problem for me. I realized that the mind is a muscle and we should train it too. If world leaders have time to work out, so do you.      [Gorbachev dismantling the USSR] I\'m amazed by the courage it took to not go for immediate gratification but to look for the best direction for the country in the long run. To me Gorbachev is a hero, at the same level as Nelson Mandela, who overcame the anger and despair of 27 years in prison. When given the power to shake the world, both of them chose to build rather than destroy.      [on Pope John Paul II balancing his duties with an exercise regime] If that guy can do it, I\'ve got to get up even earlier!      Be hungry for success, hungry to make your mark, hungry to be seen and to be heard and to have an effect. And as you move up and become successful, make sure also to be hungry for helping others. Don\'t rest on your laurels. Too many former athletes spend their lives talking about how great they were 20 years ago. So many accomplished people just coast. They wish they could still be somebody and not just talk about the past. There is much more to life than being the greatest at one thing. We learn so much when we\'re successful, so why not use what you\'ve learned, use your connections and do more with them? If you have a talent or skill that makes you happy, use it to improve your neighborhood. And if you feel a desire to do more, then go all out. You\'ll have plenty of time to rest when you\'re in the grave. Live a risky and spicy life and like Eleanor Roosevelt said, ""every day do something that scares you."" We should all stay hungry!      Memoirs are about looking back, but I\'ve lived my life by the opposite principle. At home I have a hundred photo albums starting with my childhood in Austria, and I never look at them. I\'d rather do another project or make another movie and learn from looking forward!      [on his autobiography, Total Recall] Digging up and piecing together memories proved to be as difficult as I imagined, and yet what made the work unexpectedly enjoyable was the help I got from others. I found myself swapping stories with old friends from the worlds of bodybuilding, business, sports, Hollywood and politics - a large cast of characters. I\'m grateful to all of them for helping me recreate the past and for making it immediate and friendly. Finally, I thank my family. They were generous in helping me make sure this memoir delivers on its name. And thanks especially to Maria (Shriver), for her patience with the project and for remaining as always the person I could go to whenever I got stuck.      If I accomplished and solidified my position in the bodybuilding world, from then on, I would be on a roll. Nobody would stop me.      There is no such thing as an Austrian Shakespearean actor. It doesn\'t exist.      You\'re not supposed to laugh on the (film) set.      When you\'re not on camera, stay in character, act your part, giving it everything you have in order to draw the best out of the actor who is being filmed.      It was very difficult for me in the beginning - I was told by agents and casting people that my body was \'too weird\', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance.      A few months ago, I got rear-ended by this guy. He took off, and I chased him. I will admit I drove at a slightly excessive speed. I cut him off, and two guys jumped out of the car looking tough. But when they saw me, they just said, \'Oh shit! The Terminator!\' They were nice, and gave me their information.      [on Terminator Genisys (2015)] It will be challenging because it will be a new director, and it will be a really action-packed movie. And sometimes it does get more difficult when you\'re 66 years old and doing this kind of action, versus when you\'re in your 30s or 40s!      [on his eighties rivalry with Sylvester Stallone] We had a competition. And here\'s a perfect example of how competition is healthy, because he was trying to out-do me. But I was also trying to out-do him. So who benefited? The fans. I was training harder, he was training harder. It was a competition of who has more muscles, who has more cuts, who has the lower body fat, who uses the biggest guns, who kills the most people, who has the most creative killings, and this went on and on and on. So the movies became better and better because of it. And eventually, we grew up, right?"" he said. We were doing Planet Hollywood together and we were laughing about it on the plane when we flew around. We\'ve become very good friends, and I\'m a big supporter of Sly, because I really always thought I admired him, even though there was competition. He\'s a great director, he\'s a great writer, a great actor, a great producer and also a fantastic artist. His paintings are great. And he\'s a great family man. He has it all.      I have a love interest in every one of my films: a gun.      I would never exchange my life with anybody else\'s.      If my life was a movie, no one would believe it.      No matter the nationality, no matter the religion, no matter the ethnic background, America brings out the best in people.      I went from being the Terminator to being the governator.      I know a lot of athletes and models are written off as just bodies. I never felt used for my body.      I just use my muscles as a conversation piece, like someone walking a cheetah down 42nd Street.      I was striving to be the most muscular man, and it got me into the movies. It got me everything that I have.      Failure is not an option. Everyone has to succeed.      I am a big believer in education, because when I grew up in Austria - when I grew up in Austria I had a great education. I had great teachers.      Even with my divorce and with everything, I don\'t need money.      I don\'t suffer of anything that I\'ve lost.      I think that people are interested seeing me on the screen.      You know, nothing is more important than education, because nowhere are our stakes higher; our future depends on the quality of education of our children today.      I have a private plane. But I fly commercial when I go to environmental conferences.      My friend James Cameron and I made three films together - True Lies (1994), The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). Of course, that was during his early, low-budget, art-house period.      There is no place, no country, more compassionate more generous more accepting and more welcoming than the United States of America.      Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength.      People need to be insured so when you have an accident out there, or when something catastrophic happens to you, that you\'re covered and there\'s not someone else has to pay for you. That is as simple as that.      The biggest problem that we have is that California is being run now by special interests. All of the politicians are not anymore making the moves for the people, but for special interests and we have to stop that.      To restore the trust of the people, we must reform the way the government operates.      The worst thing I can be is the same as everybody else. I hate that.      I\'m addicted to exercising and I have to do something every day.      Political courage is not political suicide.      I made my fair share of mistakes.      In our society, the women who break down barriers are those who ignore limits.      Politically there were failures. And also on the personal level, there were tremendous failures.      Start wide, expand further, and never look back.      Everything I have, my career, my success, my family, I owe to America.      When the people become involved in their government, government becomes more accountable, and our society is stronger, more compassionate, and better prepared for the challenges of the future.      I think that gay marriage should be between a man and a woman.      Help others and give something back. I guarantee you will discover that while public service improves the lives and the world around you, its greatest reward is the enrichment and new meaning it will bring your own life.      One of my movies was called True Lies (1994). It\'s what the Democrats should have called their convention.      [He was being asked on what kind of Terminator he will be playing in Terminator Genisys (2015)] It\'s a character that has been programmed to protect them, to protect Sarah Connor, but I\'m basically the same Terminator. I will destroy anything that\'s in front of me in order to save her.      The last three or four reps is what makes the muscle grow. This area of pain divides the champion from someone else who is not a champion. That\'s what most people lack, having the guts to go on and just say they\'ll go through the pain no matter what happens.      Freedom is a right ultimately defended by the sacrifice of America\'s servicemen and women.      As you know, I\'m an immigrant. I came over here as an immigrant, and what gave me the opportunities, what made me to be here today, is the open arms of Americans. I have been received. I have been adopted by America.      Well, you know, I\'m the forever optimist.      I have plenty of money, unlike other Hollywood celebrities or athletes that have not invested well.      As president, Reagan worked very well with Democrats to do big things. It is true that he worked to reduce the size of government and cut federal taxes and he eliminated many regulations, but he also raised taxes when necessary.      The mind is the limit. As long as the mind can envision the fact that you can do something, you can do it, as long as you really believe 100 percent.      [on what is like getting back into The Terminator character for Terminator Genisys (2015)] It\'s like you\'ve been doing it your whole life, because I\'m very passionate about the character. I think it\'s a great, interesting character. I think it\'s a great story. The whole concept that Cameron had way back in the early \'80s, of creating a world where machines take over and things becoming a reality that no one could even think of in those days. It\'s really been great, because the whole team is really into going all out. It is fun to be in a movie like that. The studio is very enthusiastic about the Terminator movie - the producers, the director, they\'re very talented and great visionaries. You can tell, the stages - everything is really big and exciting. It\'s been a great experience.      Well, I think that California has had a history of always spending more money than it takes in.      Gray Davis can run a dirty campaign better than anyone, but he can\'t run a state.      What we face may look insurmountable. But I learned something from all those years of training and competing. I learned something from all those sets and reps when I didn\'t think I could lift another ounce of weight. What I learned is that we are always stronger than we know.      I welcome and seek your ideas, but do not bring me small ideas; bring me big ideas to match our future.      I\'m not perfect.      I believe with all my heart that America remains \'the great idea\' that inspires the world. It is a privilege to be born here. It is an honor to become a citizen here. It is a gift to raise your family here, to vote here, and to live here.      If you work hard and play by the rules, this country is truly open to you. You can achieve anything.      My relationship to power and authority is that I\'m all for it. People need somebody to watch over them. Ninety-five percent of the people in the world need to be told what to do and how to behave.      You can scream at me, call me for a shoot at midnight, keep me waiting for hours - as long as what ends up on the screen is perfect.      I was born in Europe... and I\'ve traveled all over the world. I can tell you that there is no place, no country, that is more compassionate, more generous, more accepting, and more welcoming than the United States of America.      I am the most helpful and open up doors for everyone and I like to share.      [He was being asked how long it takes to put on the prosthetics for Terminator Genisys (2015)] I think it was two and a half hours. But it\'s not every day. It depends which stage we\'re in the story. So this is getting now towards the end. It gets more and more severe.      Women are the engine driving the growth in California\'s economy. Women make California\'s economy unique.      Milk is for babies. When you grow up you have to drink beer.      I came to Hollywood and within a decade I was one of the biggest action stars of all time.      Government\'s first duty and highest obligation is public safety.      I feel good because I believe I have made progress in rebuilding the people\'s trust in their government.      I do the same exercises I did 50 years ago and they still work. I eat the same food I ate 50 years ago and it still works.      Bodybuilding is much like any other sport. To be successful, you must dedicate yourself 100% to your training, diet and mental approach.      My own dreams fortunately came true in this great state. I became Mr. Universe; I became a successful businessman. And even though some people say I still speak with a slight accent, I have reached the top of the acting profession.      Maria is the best reason to come home.      For 20 years, Simon & Schuster asked me, \'Why don\'t you write your autobiography?\'      If it bleeds, we can kill it.      The resistance that you fight physically in the gym and the resistance that you fight in life can only build a strong character.      Training gives us an outlet for suppressed energies created by stress and thus tones the spirit just as exercise conditions the body.      The future is green energy, sustainability, renewable energy.      [on if he feels protective of The Terminator franchise] Oh, no, we had very open discussions. After I got the first script, I had a lot of questions. Some of the things didn\'t make sense. They were tweaked; they didn\'t make sense to other people either. So it was fine-tuned. It was a process. There was a period of I think a few months. There were very talented people who went off and - and the great thing is that everyone was in sync. It wasn\'t like I was going off in one direction and David Ellison was thinking differently and then Alan was thinking differently. There was none of that. I think this is a very unique project because I think everyone is very protective - not just because of the art\'s sake, but I think also because of the business\' sake. The studio sees this as, ""If we do well here, we can go with another few. We can entertain people. We can make money. We\'ve done a good job bringing back the franchise."" So everyone is in sync with that. That\'s why everyone is working around the clock here to make this a great movie.      I can promise you that when I go to Sacramento, I will pump up Sacramento.      Learned helplessness is the giving-up reaction, the quitting response that follows from the belief that whatever you do doesn\'t matter.      It\'s time to stop thinking of the Republican Party as an exclusive club where your ideological card is checked at the door, and start thinking about how we can attract more solution-based leaders like Nathan Fletcher and Anthony Adams.      People should make up their own mind about what they think of me.      I saw a woman wearing a sweatshirt with \'Guess\' on it. I said, Thyroid problem?      My body is like breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I don\'t think about it, I just have it.      And now, of course this is another thing I didn\'t count on, that now as the governor of the state of California, I am selling California worldwide. You see that? Selling.      The success I have achieved in bodybuilding, motion pictures, and business would not have been possible without the generosity of the American people and the freedom here to pursue your dreams.      We are a forward-looking people, and we must have a forward-looking government.      As long as I live, I will never forget that day 21 years ago when I raised my hand and took the oath of citizenship. Do you know how proud I was? I was so proud that I walked around with an American flag around my shoulders all day long.      \'I\'ll be back\' always sounded a little girly to me.      I didn\'t leave bodybuilding until I felt that I had gone as far as I could go. It will be the same with my film career. When I feel the time is right, I will then consider public service. I feel that the highest honor comes from serving people and your country.      If it\'s hard to remember, it\'ll be difficult to forget.      What\'s fascinating is, people in Washington would rather spend time in Hollywood, and people in Hollywood would rather spend time in Washington.      I\'ll be back.      I think Americans are very patriotic.      I have inhaled, exhaled everything.      I knew I was a winner back in the late sixties. I knew I was destined for great things. People will say that kind of thinking is totally immodest. I agree. Modesty is not a word that applies to me in any way - I hope it never will.      For me life is continuously being hungry. The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive, but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer.      It\'s simple, if it jiggles, it\'s fat.      Teddy Roosevelt is still a hero among environmentalists for his conservationist policies.      I told Warren if he mentions Prop. 13 one more time, he has to do 500 push-ups.      I speak directly to the people, and I know that the people of California want to have better leadership. They want to have great leadership. They want to have somebody that will represent them. And it doesn\'t matter if you\'re a Democrat or a Republican, young or old.      I\'m not looking for sympathy at all.      The writing is important, but the way you say the line and the pause you give it, the facial expression - all of that is very important.      (2012) The day is twenty-four hours. I sleep six hours. That leaves eighteen hours to do something.      (2012) I would always write down my New Year\'s resolutions and mark them off the way I mark off sets and reps... On New Year\'s Eve, you can just blabber out: I want to lose twenty pounds and I\'m gonna read more. But what does that mean? There\'s too many variables there. If you\'re really serious about it, then write down when you\'re gonna lose the twenty pounds by. Is it March 1? Is it June 1? Make a commitment.      (2012) The power of influence is one of the most unique powers that you can have. It\'s not the power of controlling people. It\'s developing a certain skill of communicating what you want to accomplish so that people will follow you.      (2012) It was one of my early goals to be a millionaire. In the beginning, I wanted to have a gold Rolex, a Rolls-Royce, a cheetah - just stupid things that you think of when you\'re a kid. Then time goes by. The Rolls-Royce thing went out the window, because when you get to the level where you can afford one, all of a sudden you say, ""It\'s a little bit over the top."" A cheetah? I think in California they got rid of the law that says you can have wild animals. Having a cheetah is a stupid idea.      (2012) I didn\'t get it at first. I\'ll be back. What the fuck is I\'ll? I will be back sounded much stronger in my mind. So I argued with Jim Cameron. And he said, ""Look, Arnold, I don\'t tell you how to act. Please don\'t tell me how to write."" After I saw it in the movie, I was so thankful to Cameron. That was a good lesson to learn. If someone is a good writer, stick to the script.      95% of the time you never know if a movie will be a huge success or that it will even be a sequel.      I\'m so happy I\'ve been a part of some of the biggest and best action sequences.      [The Terminator] James Cameron did an extraordinary job creating that character and whole phenomenon. I never thought we would do a sequel, catchphrases like ""I\'ll be back"" or ""Hasta la vista, baby"" would catch on and be repeated or think that 30yrs later I would be asked to come back to a franchise like this playing The Terminator, unlike Batman or James Bond.      [The Terminator] It was a small movie. We really had to cut costs all the time. We shot it very quickly. We felt we had a good story and it would be successful. But we thought it would be for certain audiences only. No-one suspected it would be in Time magazine\'s top 10 movies of the year and that successful at the box-office and that people demanded a sequel that would be the highest grossing movie of that year.      [the storm drain chase in Terminator 2] That\'s a fantastic scene.      Most people are not comfortable with guns.      [being Governor of California] I had my hands full.      [James Cameron\'s movies] Extraordinary inspiration because it makes other directors online.      [California] The seventh largest economy in the world.      [James] Cameron has really stretched it beyond belief with visual effects in Judgment Day.      [on becoming President of the United States]If I\'d been born in America, I would\'ve run.[October 2016]      [on the 2016 Presidential election]for the first time since I became a citizen in 1983,I will not vote for the republican candidate for President.Salary (22)Hercules in New York\xa0(1970)      $12,000       Conan the Barbarian\xa0(1982)      $250,000       Conan the Destroyer\xa0(1984)      $1,000,000       The Terminator\xa0(1984)      $750,000       Commando\xa0(1985)      $1,500,000       Predator\xa0(1987)      $3,000,000       The Running Man\xa0(1987)      $5,000,000       Red Heat\xa0(1988)      $8,000,000       Total Recall\xa0(1990)      $10,000,000       Kindergarten Cop\xa0(1990)      $12,000,000       Terminator 2: Judgment Day\xa0(1991)      $15,000,000       Last Action Hero\xa0(1993)      $15,000,000       True Lies\xa0(1994)      $15,000,000       Junior\xa0(1994)      $15,000,000       Eraser\xa0(1996)      $20,000,000       Jingle All the Way\xa0(1996)      $20,000,000       Batman & Robin\xa0(1997)      $25,000,000       End of Days\xa0(1999)      $22,000,000       The 6th Day\xa0(2000)      $25,000,000       Collateral Damage\xa0(2002)      $25,000,000       Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\xa0(2003)      $29,250,000       The Last Stand\xa0(2013)      $5,000,000 +25% of first dollar          if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nPaul Lynde ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 38 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(2)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(21)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(10)  Overview (4)Date of Birth13\xa0June1926,\xa0Mount Vernon, Ohio, USA Date of Death10\xa0January1982,\xa0Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California, USA      \xa0(cardiac arrest due to extreme substance abuse)    Birth NamePaul Edward LyndeHeight5\'\xa011""\xa0(1.8\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Paul Lynde was born in 1926 in Mount Vernon, Ohio (one of six children and the middle of four boys). His father was a local police officer and the sheriff of the Mount Vernon Jail for two years. Lynde got his inspiration to become an actor at the age of four or five after his mother took him to see the original silent film Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925). After graduating from Northwestern University, Lynde relocated to New York City where his first break came from being a stand-up comedian at the Number One Fifth Avenue nightclub. Then came an appearance on a Broadway show, ""New Faces of 1952"".Lynde also had a two-year run on TV with The Perry Como Show (1948) and the Broadway and film versions of Bye Bye Birdie (1963). Throught his life, Lynde appeared in the Broadway plays ""The Impossible Years"", ""Don\'t Drink the Water"", and ""Plaza Suite"". His many film credits include New Faces (1954), Send Me No Flowers (1964), and Rabbit Test (1978). One of his most memorable roles was a recurring role on Bewitched (1964) playing the sneering, sarcastic Uncle Arthur. He appeared on TV\'s The Dean Martin Show (1965), The Kraft Music Hall (1967), Donny and Marie (1975), and both the prime-time and daytime versions of the game show The Hollywood Squares (1965) where he occupied the famous center square. He had two TV series of his own, The Paul Lynde Show (1972) and Temperatures Rising (1972). Paul Lynde\'s witty, wisecracking one-liners and his novel line delivery made him one of Hollywood\'s funniest and best loved entertainers. Paul Lynde died under mysterious circumstances when he was found dead in his bed after possibly suffering a heart attack in January 1982 at age 55. He had been in ill-health for over a year with cancer or some other illness that was never fully revealed to the public before or after his death.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Anonymous          Trade Mark (2)        His distinctive laugh after every joke he made on The Hollywood Squares (1965)        Nasally voiceTrivia (21)      Attended Northwestern University (Evanston, IL).      Posthumously ""outed"" by Boze Hadleigh, who has written extensively about previously closeted Hollywood actors/actresses.      The coroner who examined his body said he had the heart of an 88-year-old man.      Told his agent shortly before his death that he had given up cigarettes and alcohol.      Long-time ""center square"" and court jester in residence on the original The Hollywood Squares (1965), Paul Lynde\'s quips on that show are still quoted, and laughed at, to this day.      A fan once set up a museum full of Paul Lynde memorabilia in his home town on Mount Vernon, Ohio      His older brother Cordon died in World War II.      Lynde left The Hollywood Squares (1965) in 1979, in a dispute over his salary. When tabloids ran stories claiming he had been fired for his drinking as well as on-set problems, he sued them for libel, seeking $10 million in damages.      Explained his lifelong bachelorhood to fans (in the days before ""coming out"") by telling them his high-school sweetheart had broken his heart, and he was still too hurt to give other women a chance.      His classmates at Northwestern University included Cloris Leachman, Charlotte Rae, Jeffrey Hunter, Claude Akins, Martha Hyer, Patricia Neal, and Agnes Nixon.      He had a weight problem that he fought to control his entire life.      When he first went to New York, he lived in an apartment building that housed many other struggling actors. The building had communal kitchens, kitchens shared by all the tenants of a floor. One of the other actors in the building claimed that Lynde used to steal his food from the refrigerator. That actor was a young Marlon Brando.      Holds a unique place in show business history - he actually got to sing on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" the song he performed nightly in the Broadway musical ""Bye Bye Birdie"" about the excitement of appearing on the iconic ""Ed Sullivan Show"".      In ""Center Square: The Paul Lynde Story,"" biographers Steve Wilson and Joe Florenski lay to rest rumors that there was something suspicious about Lynde\'s death at the age of 55. Dismissing such rumors that the comedian was murdered by a hustler who robbed Lynde\'s house and left him dead and naked, the authors say that Lynde did die of a heart attack, as the coroner\'s report contended he did. Lynde expired at almost the same age as his father, who also died from a heart attack. The authors express surprise that Lynde didn\'t have a heart attack sooner, what with his transgressive lifestyle. Lynde was heavily into alcohol and also used drugs. He claimed to have quit these habits cold-turkey not long before his death, having been transformed by a personal event that he never revealed.      The sign proclaiming Mount Vernon, Ohio, as the birthplace of Paul Lynde was recently changed to read: ""Home of Daniel Decatur Emmett, Author of [the song] \'Dixie.\'""      Lynde and long-term companion, Bing Davidson were staying at the Drake hotel in San Francisco, California on July 17, 1965. The two went out the next day for a good time and got very drunk. Davidson decided to show Lynde a trick and dangled off the hotel balcony by his fingers. He was slipping and Paul desperately tried to help him in, but Davidson fell to his death. They are buried next to each other in Amity Cemetery in Ohio.      Was an accomplished cook.      Portrayed Mr. MacAfee in the original Broadway stage version of ""Bye Bye Birdie"" which opened April 14, 1960 and ran for 607 performances. He reprised the role in the film Bye Bye Birdie (1963).      His father\'s name was Hoy Lynde, and his mother\'s name was Sylvia Bell. He had three brothers: Richard, Cord, and John.      One of only a handful of actors to have appeared on both ""magic"" television shows Bewitched and I Dream Of Jeannie.      Paul had two sisters.Personal Quotes (10)      Upon telling his family he wanted to go into show business: ""My dad hit the roof and I hit the road, simultaneously.""      I don\'t know who the hell Paul Lynde is or why he\'s funny, and I prefer it to be a mystery to me. An actor shouldn\'t undergo psychoanalysis, because there are a lot of things you\'re better off not knowing.      I have so many friends who were lovers. After they got married, it was over.      I\'m used to living alone, and I like it that way. You become so selfish living alone...I\'d make a terrible husband anyway.      I don\'t meet enough women outside show business, and I wouldn\'t marry anyone in this field. [in 1969]      Sometimes, I think you\'re better off not being married today. When you see your married friends split up, it\'s devastating. Call it scared! Call it an obsession. But I took it for granted I was going to marry a girl I went with for nine years.

I was in the film version, but they should have retitled it \'Hello, Ann-Margret!\' They cut several of my and the other actors\' best scenes and shot new ones for her so she could do her teenage-sex-bombshell act.      I had a drag scene in Doris Day\'s The Glass Bottom Boat (1966). An elegant gown. Actually, it was more expensive than any of the ones Doris had to wear.

You people have completely missed the point of the movie! When Kirk
Douglas falls off the cliff, or off his horse, he is not intended to be
hurt! Didn't you get it when he painted a tunnel on the big rock, and
Arnold and Ann PASS right through it? Then when Douglas tries it, he
runs splat into the rock! It is a very funny comedy! COMEDY being the
key word here. Arnold has some great lines in this movie as does Ann
Margaret. This is your classic Saturday Morning Wile E.
Coyote/Roadrunner cartoon done in a live version. Don't worry so much
about the acting, and just enjoy the movie.<br><br>Also, Ann Margaret is NOT 63 in this movie, and she is VERY hot looking

I can't understand why most people think every movie is trying to be Citizen
Kane. I mean I love steak, but I would tire of it if I had to eat it every
day. Sometimes you need pudding. This movie is pudding..not much substance
but tastes great while it's in your mouth. I hadn't thought about this movie
in ages until I was reading a bio on Arnold. This movie is a live action
cartoon. It's goofy, silly and other adjectives that end in y, but it's fun
to watch. It's especially fun to see it on those Sunday afternoons when
nothing is on, but car racing and fishing. (With the advent of cable this
has become a rare occasion, but I think most people will agree that even
with 150 channels it's still hard to find something you want to watch.) If
you get a chance to see this movie and don't take yourself too seriously you

I'm not quite sure why Kirk Douglas took the part of a live Wile E.
Coyote in the film villain other than to say that he had now tried the
slapstick comedy genre. But in this case the frustrated coyote is not
matched up with the beeping road runner. His adversary is Dudley

sees Daddy's little girl and Arnie whom she pants after, but who
doesn't show the slightest interest.<br><br>The bulk of the film is taken up with Kirk as villainous Cactus Jack

them of a large sum of money from banker Jack Elam to Strother Martin.

place.<br><br>I'm sure Kirk Douglas liked the change of pace, burlesquing his own
western image. And he had a tough assignment because the majority of

If you like goofy-funny movies, this is a classic that will keep you
laughing! Ann-Margaret plays the gorgeous Charming Jones, who recruits
the help of Handsome Stranger (a VERY young Arnold Schwarzenegger) to
escort her as she transfers her inherited fortune. Wealthy Avery
Simpson, played by Jack Elam, wants her inheritance, and hires has-been
cowboy Cactus Jack Slade (Kirk Douglas) to rob her. Slade, along with
his horse Whiskey (the REAL star of this film!), keeps you in stitches
with his Road Runner antics as he makes countless attempts to get the
loot. This film is completed with the appearance of other stars that
tie it all together, including Paul Lynde, Foster Brooks, Strother

for anyone who enjoys comedy westerns!

Zombie Holocaust is an entertaining diversion. If you regularly comb
the drecks of Italian horror garbage, you've seen much worse. This is a
spliced-together film, like Mattei's Hell of The Living Dead, only this
one cobbles two dumb gory b-movies together. There's a heavy dip in the
fondue pot in store for this stink-ridden pile of sleazy excrement, and
by that I mean I like it. Not only does this s hit sizzle but its got
recognizable faces in it: Ian McCulloch from Zombie; Alexandra Delli
Colli from The New York Ripper; Donald O'Brien from Emanuelle and the
Last Cannibals, and a black guy who was in Zombie. I'm not racist, I
just don't remember his name.<br><br>Like I said, there's two movies here (at least!)-- one involving a
psychotic doctor and the other being a cannibal/zombie film. So you'd
think there would be a lot going on here. But there isn't. It's just an
onslaught of cheap gore scenes. One scene has Ian McCulloch defending
himself with an outboard motor to an attacking zombie's face. HIS FACE.
And if that ain't enough, Delli Colli has the camera pointed at her
bush for the last fifteen minutes of the movie. Based on that alone,
you should be scrambling to get to the video store. But seriously,
there's dozens more treats in this movie including disembowelings,
throat gashings, and skull-sawing autopsies.<br><br>If you love films like Hell of The Living Dead, Virus, or City of The
Walking Dead, you'll probably enjoy this one so give it a shot. It's
brain taffy.

besides the disturbing subject matter and ferocious gore, these films
are also usually have really interesting, dare I say fascinating
stories. That's right. Quality B-movies do exist, after all. However,
Zombi Holocaust is not one of them. It looks like your stuck with just
the gore. I think it'll be fine. I mean, just because this one doesn't
hold up against the almighty Cannibal Ferox and Cannibal Holocaust,
doesn't necessarily mean it's not worth your time. And really. Who
wouldn't want a film called Zombi Holocaust in their Horror collection?
Not I.<br><br>Besides what I've already told you, the one thing you might want to
consider, going in to this film, is that it's a Zombie movie. I suppose
you already had that figured out. But still, Zombi Holocaust does
include cannibals, as well as a jungle. Best of both worlds? More like
a touch of both worlds. Nothing groundbreaking from either side of the
fence. And on top of all that, Zombi Holocaust is also a mad scientist
flick. We start out at a hospital, where corpses are being mutilated.
Eventually, a cannibal is caught in the act. I guess it was shame that
drove the poor guy to unconvincingly jumping out the window. Obviously,
tomfoolery like this is not something you'd want going on at your local
hospital. Curiosity gets the best of Ian McCullough and some hot chick.
For some reason, this hospital mystery lies somewhere in the
Carribbean. A mad doctor is slowly turning a tribe of cannibals into
zombies. Zombies who don't really do much of anything, as the cannibals
are the only ones willing to start trouble. Whatever. It's a movie. So,
this guy must be stopped, right? And in case you're wondering, all that
doesn't turn out nearly as entertaining as it sounds. Ultimately, if
you're a fan of such classics as Burial Ground and Jungle Holocaust, I
see no reason why you shouldn't get a kick out of Zombi Holocaust, at
least out of sheer principle. Well, unless you're not too big on stupid
movies with ridiculous dialogue, and awful acting. In that case, you
may want to stay clear of this one. 7/10

Put them together and you get a completely mindless movie! Yes, the
title of this film is completely misleading (the Zombie Holocaust one)
as when I hear it, I imagine hordes of zombies rampaging the
countryside. Instead, what we mainly get is a cannibal horror film
fused together with a mad doctor film with a dash of zombies in it for
taste. It shares a lot of similarities to Lucio Fulci's Zombie movie
too as it features Ian McCulloch and another actor from that film and
it appears to be on the exact same island! When they first drive to the
one doctor's house they go down a street and it looks exactly like a
scene out of Zombie, heck the donkey may have even been in Zombie. They
depart in terms of plot; however, as this one does not focus on the
zombie aspect. Well, it does not really focus on anything, as nothing
anyone in this film does makes much sense. I think they just tried to
fuse to many sub genres together without a complete script or
something.<br><br>The story of this one is the weakest element of the film, because at
times it almost seems like there is none. There are mutilations in a
hospital in New York and it is soon learned that it is the work of a
cannibal. Other cannibals turn up here and there because somehow they
can just get jobs at hospitals. A group of four people travel to an
island for reasons that are really no one's business, because them
going makes absolutely no sense. They meet a doctor who provides them
with some yummy looking lemonade and then they are off to another
island where the cannibals live. The group which now includes three
very expendable helpers and another dude soon find themselves under
assail from the cannibals who get scared by zombies going ""Ah"" and
nearly everyone is killed, but the two survivors decide to try and
figure out the mystery even though it literally accomplishes nothing.<br><br>The film moves at a rather fast pace and it features some good Italian
splatter and some good nudity too. That makes the film at least
watchable, but the plot is so horrendously bad that I just cannot score
it any higher. Some of the effects are rather horrible too, as at one
point one of the cannibals is caught in New York and he proceeds to
jump out a window. It is obviously a mannequin and when it impacts the
ground, its arm pops off! I realize they may not want to redo the
scene, but they could have at least jump cut and edited that part out!
The mad doctor is the only person who seems to know what he is doing,
but making a race of ineffective zombies seems kind of a waste of time.
Just too much bad in this one to overcome even with the nice gore and
very hot blond.<br><br>So this film is a combination film, but I think they just tried to do
too much. At times it is a cannibal film, at other a mad doctor and
then a bit of zombies in there for effect. Heck, the scenes where the
blond undress could be considered soft core porn because the music is
right out of one! They just tried to do much, and as I have said, I
just do not think they had fully completed script to go along with it
all. Though another interesting aspect of the film is its similarities
to Zombie; however, that one is the superior film as it makes a bit
more sense why things are happening and why they go to the island.
Here, it just makes no sense at all.

<br><br>Another film known by many names (eight, to be
precise, that IMDB has been able to track down), Zombi
Holocaust is probably best known by American cult-film
devotees as Dr. Butcher, MD. I ended up picking this
one up because there are a rather large number of
crossovers with Lucio Fulci's brilliant splatterfest
Zombie-- writer Fabrizio DeAngelis was one of the
producers of Fulci's film, male lead Ian McCulloch was
the lead in Zombie, character actor Dakkar plays a
native guide in both, etc. (Most interesting, one of
the film's actors, Walter Patriarca, was Zombie's
costume designer. Go figger.)<br><br>Simple plot, which should sound familiar to anyone
who's seen Fulci's film; a number of deaths occur in
New York City, and Ian McCollouch, a beautiful
sidekick, and two of their pals end up going to a
remote Caribbean island where there's an
English-speaking doctor who treats the natives. Sound
familiar?<br><br>For about the first forty-five minutes of this film, I
was too busy thinking that it was exactly like Zombie
to be impressed. (No one, these days, is sure which
film came out first, and most people also draw
parallels to another classic of the genre that came
out the same year, Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal
Holocaust.) Then Ian McCollouch disposes of a zombie
with a motorboat motor, and suddenly things started
getting a whole lot more fun. Rather like The Evil
Dead, this is a film where there's a whole lot of
setup (though Raimi pulled it off miles better), but
when the gore starts, the director lays it on thick,
fast, and ugly. And while death-by-propeller is
probably the funniest and nastiest scene in the film,
there's certainly more than enough blood
flowing/spraying/dripping/being drunk/etc. to please
most fans of hardcore horror. Pound for pound, though,
in comparison to Zombie, the latter stands up as the
better film. As one reviewer put it, ""Fulci... might
have had the sauce, but [he] passed on the cheese.""
Fulci's obsessive attention to detail, better
scriptwriting, and stunning score give Fulci the edge
over Girolami. But man, it's fun to be the judge. ***<br><br>

""Zombi Holocaust"" is a rather fun cheesy zombie film.<br><br>**SPOILERS**<br><br>During a routine autopsy, medical student Lori Ridgeway, (Alexandra
Delli Colli) notices that the cadaver is incomplete, despite being in
excellent condition the night before. As this trend continues, she
finally goes to her boss, Dr. Dreylock, (Walter Patriarca) who refers
her to Dr. Peter Chandler, (Ian McCulloch) a member of an investigating
board for similar such incidents. As they continue, she notices a sign
on one that resembles a sign from a small Southeast Asian island and
convinces him to put together a team to investigate. Gathering his
assistant George Harper, (Peter O'Neal) and girlfriend Susan Kelly,
(Sherry Buchanan) to go along, and head to the island. There, they find
the place is full of cannibals from a long-lost tribe, and a strange
doctor performing strange operations on the locals. When they become
the next targets for the experiment, they try to get off the island
alive.<br><br>The Good News: This was a pretty pleasant surprise. It's big plus is
that it feels like a great mixture of two big genres, namely the
cannibal and zombie sub-genres. That it uses the tale-tell signs of the
two, and convincingly, makes this one a really entertaining and clever
entry. The cannibals, surprisingly, get the majority of the screen-time
spent, as it's going to their home-place based on speculation of their
existence, and that in turn reveals the truth about the zombies in a
not-exactly-new twist revealed towards the end. There's also plenty of
gore in the film, as this one has some pretty nice kills in it. There's
a really impressive one where a victim is impaled from a trap that
shoots up from behind to impale through the body rather than the other
way around, with a severe series of dismemberments and skin devouring
to follow, some really great impalements, surgical amputations and a
rather shocking scene where one gets their face torn up by a rotating
motorboat engine. That's not to include all the really wicked surgeries
done in the film, which are also quite impressive and really bloody.
That there's also some really juicy skin-devouring really helps to make
this one bloody and gory. The fact that it remains watchable all the
way through to the end is another big plus, as this one doesn't really
get boring and features enough action spots to stay interesting, and
only without a big taste for cheese will this one fail. These all make
it quite entertaining.<br><br>The Bad News: There isn't a whole lot wrong with this one. One of the
big ones is it's incredibly high cheese factor. There's a lot of that
in the film, which can be evidenced by the general plot description.
This also has marks for it in that category for it's gore and general
atmosphere, which is a mark as it's not all that well received by most.
That this one revels so heavily in it makes it something to be avoided
by those who aren't that into that style. This one also has the problem
in that it doesn't really do the big points from it's meshed styles.
For a zombie film, these don't really feel like zombies most of the
time, as they rarely do anything more than stand around and take
orders, and aren't in the film very long to begin with. They're
involved in the last twenty minutes of the film, and it doesn't really
feature them a whole lot in that time-span. As well, there isn't a lot
of time spent on the cannibal tribe getting to know them. All that's
known about them is the name and island where they live, which is
basically it. This here needed more information on them. Otherwise, the
cheesiness is the main problem with this one.<br><br>The Final Verdict: While not the greatest entry in either the Italian
cannibal or zombie genres, this one does have enough to like about it
that fans of both will be happy. See this one if you're a fan of either
of those two genres, or are just in the mood for a quick, cheesy time,
while those not in the mood for such a film or aren't fans altogether
should seek caution.<br><br>Rated UR/R: Graphic Violence, Full Nudity and Language

Being an obsessive-compulsive fan of old-fashioned Euro-gore for
several years now, I've come to expect the absurd (and usually
nonsensical) plots, the constant 'borrowing' from other films, and the
over-the-top gore, all mixed together to form what is usually an
enjoyably trashy cocktail. I picked up ""Zombie Holocaust"" with some
optimism and a little knowledge of its reputation, and after watching
it, could only help but wonder what had just happened. No, it wasn't
the incoherently surreal thrill of watching ""City of the Living Dead,""
but a general, head-scratching confusion that raised questions such as:
""How was this awful waste of time ever released?"" As Tom Servo would
say: ""Meanwhile, in YET ANOTHER MOVIE..."" ""Zombie Holocaust"" doesn't
have a brain in its head (even though the title Doctor is a deranged
neurosurgeon)--it's a low-budget splatter flick without even the
slightest hint of innovation. It borrows settings and characters from
Fulci's ""Zombie"" (not to mention a few actual snippets from that film),
jungle savages from ""Make Them Die Slowly,"" and a couple bronze-faced
zombies that look an awful lot like the wooden-toothed wonders in
""Burial Ground."" Sounds like a swinging good time, but the movie is
downright distracting in its own indecisiveness, flipping back and
forth between these awkwardly, incompetently blended genres without a
hint of wit or style. Perhaps this is attributable to Fabrizio de
Angelis, who is known less for his screen writing capabilities than as
a producer on Lucio Fulci's most notable works. It is conceivable that
the producers wanted to churn out a genre-bending smörgåsbord knowing
they would get some return on it, but the utter ridiculousness of the
finished product is an endurance test for the viewer's patience.<br><br>Ian McCulloch (his usual stuffy self) and Alexandra Delli Colli (""New
York Ripper"") venture off to some faraway island to investigate a
doctor's odd practices. Along the way, they encounter hostile natives,
zombies, and an climax that looks suspiciously like another, better
zombie flick. Eyeballs are gouged out, entrails are eaten, and Delli
Colli is painted in the nude for a ""Laugh-In"" audition.<br><br>There's ultimately nothing in ""Zombie Holocaust"" that hasn't been done
before, and better. Pass.

A splatter classic, Marino Girolami's ""Zombi Holocaust"" of 1980 doesn't
scant with blood and gore. A true B-movie and pure exploitation, this
movie is probably not high art, however, I don't suppose that anybody
who is about to watch a movie entitled ""Zombie Holocaust"" is gonna
expect Citizen Kane.<br><br>After several mutilations of corpses in the morgue of a New York
hospital, and the appearance of a mysterious cannibal sign, a group of
people, amongst them a beautiful female doctor and a bitchy journalist,
decide to go on an expedition to a tropical island, where they expect
to find out about the sign's origin. This is, of course, not a very
good idea. Not only is the island inhabited by cannibals, but it is
also haunted by the living dead.<br><br>One of the classic Italian splatter flicks, ""Zombi Holocaust"", is a fun
and entertaining, although not very thrilling movie, that mainly
concentrates on the enormous amounts of blood and gore and on constant
very graphical violence. The acting in this movie differs. As a huge
fan of Spaghetti Westerns, I found it cool to see Donal O'Brien, who
delivers a great performance as a mad scientist in this, in a
non-western role. The Italian and English title is maybe not the best
to describe the movie, since its the Cannibals, and not the Zombies who
kill the most people. The German title ""Zombies Unter Kannibalen""
(""Zombies Amongst Cannibals"") is probably better to describe the film's
content.<br><br>All things considered, ""Zombie Holocaust"" is a highly entertaining and
very bloody Gorefest that fans of the Cannibal subgenre should not
miss. Entertainment guaranteed!

Zombi Holocaust is a Cannible film, Zombie film and Mad scientist film
thrown together to make one really gory movie. Some scenes are similar
to Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2 such as it starts in New York and then they go
into the tropical island, the Zombies in the island's church. Even two
of the actors from Zombi 2 are in Zombi Holocaust.<br><br>The scenes with the Cannibles killing and eating the people are nice
and gory, the Zombie make up is good and kind of similar to Zombi 2's
Zombie make up. One problem is that we don't see much of the Zombies at
first but halfway through the film they do show up.<br><br>The Mad Scientist elements are something new since Zombi 2 didn't have
a man trying to create Zombies for his research and uses the Cannibles
for his experiments. Zombi Holocaust is a great Zombie flick with some
good gore effects. Check this out.

Dr. Obrero (Dan O' Brien) is experimenting on corpses on a remote

later.<br><br>The movie has some nice gore (surgical and otherwise-including an
awesome motorboat engine to the head death) and nudity to liven things
up, as well as a fun score and tons of camp. Also, unlike other Italian
gore flicks of the time, the movie features a little intentional humor
to go with it (""The patients screaming disturbed me, performed removal
of vocal chords""-that line always gets me), which after the downbeat
feeling of Fulci's zombie movies, is something of a breath of undead
air. It's nice to see an Italian gore flick that doesn't take itself
too seriously for a change.<br><br>If there is any problem, it's that the zombie aspect feels rather
underplayed, as they aren't used for much. Sure, there's that
aforementioned death by boat motor, but they don't do a whole lot to
threaten the team, as the cannibals are more of a threat. Still,
""Zombie Holocaust"" is a blast of exploitation that fans of over the top

Zombie Holocaust (aka Dr. Butcher MD Medical Deviate in the United
States) is a film that capitalizes on the success of the now cult
classic cannibal and zombie films of the late 70's and early 80's such
as Zombi 2, Cannibal Ferox, and Burial Ground etc. The movie begins
with a mysterious man stealing body parts from cadavers in a New York
hospital for a ""late night snack."" What is with these Italian zombie
films and New York connections anyways? The man is eventually
discovered and promptly flings himself out of the hospital window
before anyone can question him. Upon investigating his body we discover
that he bears markings that link him to a native cannibal tribe on an
island off of the South American coast (here we go again) and our leads
are sent to investigate. Ian McCulloch (of Zombi 2 fame) plays Dr.
Peter Chandler (Peter...also in Zombi 2...weird) and reprises his role
as a zombie slayer and travels with anthropologist and medical student
Lori Ridgeway (Alexandra Delli Colli) to the island to meet with Dr.
Obrero (Donald O'Brien) whose questionable character leads to an
interesting twist in the movies latter half. Upoon our characters
arrival at the island they encounter cannibal mayhem, zombie carnage,
and some crazy doctor antics that make for the aforementioned twist.<br><br>Zombie Holocaust falls into one of my favorite categories,
Euro-zombie-trash! These movies usually contain an overabundance of
gore, nudity, bad acting, and a plot with enough holes to embarrass a
slice of Swiss. Zombie Holocaust does not let down in any of these
categories except acting; the acting here is fairly solid. GO IAN! The
movie was released in America as Dr. Butcher MD as mentioned above and
it contains a different opening. Despite common belief, that is the
ONLY significant difference between the two films. The Dr. Butcher
version contains an R rating but does not lack any of the gore in the
Zombie Holocaust version. The Euro-cut is superior to me only because
A) it is the original, and B) because the introduction spoils the whole
zombie revealing that remains kind of mysterious in Zombie Holocaust
until about halfway through the movie. You find yourself wondering how
the will fit in them BAM! There they are. Things to look forward to in
Zombie Holocaust include some really well done gore scenes including
some eyes being ripped out and eaten, graphic disembowelments, a
machete to the head, some likely unsanitary surgeries, and the
grand-daddy of them all here, an running outboard boat engine propeller
to the head of an attacking zombie! Oh... and the nudity, there is
plenty of that! <br><br>The version of the movie that I own comes from Shriek Show (a division
of Media Blasters) and has both crisp image and sound, despite the
atrocious dubbing! I still don't understand why we can't just get the
original language tracks with English subtitles!? The movie came as
part of the highly recommended Zombie Pack 2 (along with Burial Ground:
The Nights of Terror and Flesh Eater). Shriek Show, as usual, packed
this one with extras including both American and German trailers, an
extensive poster and still gallery, an interview with the EFX director,
the opening segments of the US release with commentary, and a slew of
trailers for other zombie and cannibals flicks of the era. This movie
is something that any true zombie/cannibal aficionado should have in
there collection. It is comparable to Zombi 2, so don't be surprised if
some of the zombies or the sets look the same.<br><br>Overall, if you are a fan of zombies, cannibals, Ian McCulloch, extreme
gore, movies with mad scientists/doctors, or a combination thereof, you
should check this out. An overall excellent flick in my opinion.

Zombie Holocaust is an entertaining diversion. If you regularly comb
the drecks of Italian horror garbage, you've seen much worse. This is a
spliced-together film, like Mattei's Hell of The Living Dead, only this
one cobbles two dumb gory b-movies together. There's a heavy dip in the
fondue pot in store for this stink-ridden pile of sleazy excrement, and
by that I mean I like it. Not only does this s hit sizzle but its got
recognizable faces in it: Ian McCulloch from Zombie; Alexandra Delli
Colli from The New York Ripper; Donald O'Brien from Emanuelle and the
Last Cannibals, and a black guy who was in Zombie. I'm not racist, I
just don't remember his name.<br><br>Like I said, there's two movies here (at least!)-- one involving a
psychotic doctor and the other being a cannibal/zombie film. So you'd
think there would be a lot going on here. But there isn't. It's just an
onslaught of cheap gore scenes. One scene has Ian McCulloch defending
himself with an outboard motor to an attacking zombie's face. HIS FACE.
And if that ain't enough, Delli Colli has the camera pointed at her
bush for the last fifteen minutes of the movie. Based on that alone,
you should be scrambling to get to the video store. But seriously,
there's dozens more treats in this movie including disembowelings,
throat gashings, and skull-sawing autopsies.<br><br>If you love films like Hell of The Living Dead, Virus, or City of The
Walking Dead, you'll probably enjoy this one so give it a shot. It's

flowing/spraying/dripping/being drunk/etc. to please
most fans of hardcore horror. Pound for pound, though,
in comparison to Zombie, the latter stands up as the
better film. As one reviewer put it, ""Fulci... might
have had the sauce, but [he] passed on the cheese.""
Fulci's obsessive attention to detail, better
scriptwriting, and stunning score give Fulci the edge
over Girolami. But man, it's fun to be the judge. ***<br><br>

""Zombi Holocaust"" is a rather fun cheesy zombie film.<br><br>**SPOILERS**<br><br>During a routine autopsy, medical student Lori Ridgeway, (Alexandra
Delli Colli) notices that the cadaver is incomplete, despite being in
excellent condition the night before. As this trend continues, she
finally goes to her boss, Dr. Dreylock, (Walter Patriarca) who refers
her to Dr. Peter Chandler, (Ian McCulloch) a member of an investigating
board for similar such incidents. As they continue, she notices a sign
on one that resembles a sign from a small Southeast Asian island and
convinces him to put together a team to investigate. Gathering his
assistant George Harper, (Peter O'Neal) and girlfriend Susan Kelly,
(Sherry Buchanan) to go along, and head to the island. There, they find
the place is full of cannibals from a long-lost tribe, and a strange
doctor performing strange operations on the locals. When they become
the next targets for the experiment, they try to get off the island
alive.<br><br>The Good News: This was a pretty pleasant surprise. It's big plus is
that it feels like a great mixture of two big genres, namely the
cannibal and zombie sub-genres. That it uses the tale-tell signs of the
two, and convincingly, makes this one a really entertaining and clever
entry. The cannibals, surprisingly, get the majority of the screen-time
spent, as it's going to their home-place based on speculation of their
existence, and that in turn reveals the truth about the zombies in a
not-exactly-new twist revealed towards the end. There's also plenty of
gore in the film, as this one has some pretty nice kills in it. There's
a really impressive one where a victim is impaled from a trap that
shoots up from behind to impale through the body rather than the other
way around, with a severe series of dismemberments and skin devouring
to follow, some really great impalements, surgical amputations and a
rather shocking scene where one gets their face torn up by a rotating
motorboat engine. That's not to include all the really wicked surgeries
done in the film, which are also quite impressive and really bloody.
That there's also some really juicy skin-devouring really helps to make
this one bloody and gory. The fact that it remains watchable all the
way through to the end is another big plus, as this one doesn't really
get boring and features enough action spots to stay interesting, and
only without a big taste for cheese will this one fail. These all make
it quite entertaining.<br><br>The Bad News: There isn't a whole lot wrong with this one. One of the
big ones is it's incredibly high cheese factor. There's a lot of that
in the film, which can be evidenced by the general plot description.
This also has marks for it in that category for it's gore and general
atmosphere, which is a mark as it's not all that well received by most.
That this one revels so heavily in it makes it something to be avoided
by those who aren't that into that style. This one also has the problem
in that it doesn't really do the big points from it's meshed styles.
For a zombie film, these don't really feel like zombies most of the
time, as they rarely do anything more than stand around and take
orders, and aren't in the film very long to begin with. They're
involved in the last twenty minutes of the film, and it doesn't really
feature them a whole lot in that time-span. As well, there isn't a lot
of time spent on the cannibal tribe getting to know them. All that's
known about them is the name and island where they live, which is
basically it. This here needed more information on them. Otherwise, the
cheesiness is the main problem with this one.<br><br>The Final Verdict: While not the greatest entry in either the Italian
cannibal or zombie genres, this one does have enough to like about it
that fans of both will be happy. See this one if you're a fan of either
of those two genres, or are just in the mood for a quick, cheesy time,
while those not in the mood for such a film or aren't fans altogether
should seek caution.<br><br>Rated UR/R: Graphic Violence, Full Nudity and Language

Being an obsessive-compulsive fan of old-fashioned Euro-gore for
several years now, I've come to expect the absurd (and usually
nonsensical) plots, the constant 'borrowing' from other films, and the
over-the-top gore, all mixed together to form what is usually an
enjoyably trashy cocktail. I picked up ""Zombie Holocaust"" with some
optimism and a little knowledge of its reputation, and after watching
it, could only help but wonder what had just happened. No, it wasn't
the incoherently surreal thrill of watching ""City of the Living Dead,""
but a general, head-scratching confusion that raised questions such as:
""How was this awful waste of time ever released?"" As Tom Servo would
say: ""Meanwhile, in YET ANOTHER MOVIE..."" ""Zombie Holocaust"" doesn't
have a brain in its head (even though the title Doctor is a deranged
neurosurgeon)--it's a low-budget splatter flick without even the
slightest hint of innovation. It borrows settings and characters from
Fulci's ""Zombie"" (not to mention a few actual snippets from that film),
jungle savages from ""Make Them Die Slowly,"" and a couple bronze-faced
zombies that look an awful lot like the wooden-toothed wonders in
""Burial Ground."" Sounds like a swinging good time, but the movie is
downright distracting in its own indecisiveness, flipping back and
forth between these awkwardly, incompetently blended genres without a
hint of wit or style. Perhaps this is attributable to Fabrizio de
Angelis, who is known less for his screen writing capabilities than as
a producer on Lucio Fulci's most notable works. It is conceivable that
the producers wanted to churn out a genre-bending smörgåsbord knowing
they would get some return on it, but the utter ridiculousness of the
finished product is an endurance test for the viewer's patience.<br><br>Ian McCulloch (his usual stuffy self) and Alexandra Delli Colli (""New
York Ripper"") venture off to some faraway island to investigate a
doctor's odd practices. Along the way, they encounter hostile natives,
zombies, and an climax that looks suspiciously like another, better
zombie flick. Eyeballs are gouged out, entrails are eaten, and Delli
Colli is painted in the nude for a ""Laugh-In"" audition.<br><br>There's ultimately nothing in ""Zombie Holocaust"" that hasn't been done
before, and better. Pass.

A splatter classic, Marino Girolami's ""Zombi Holocaust"" of 1980 doesn't
scant with blood and gore. A true B-movie and pure exploitation, this
movie is probably not high art, however, I don't suppose that anybody
who is about to watch a movie entitled ""Zombie Holocaust"" is gonna
expect Citizen Kane.<br><br>After several mutilations of corpses in the morgue of a New York
hospital, and the appearance of a mysterious cannibal sign, a group of
people, amongst them a beautiful female doctor and a bitchy journalist,
decide to go on an expedition to a tropical island, where they expect
to find out about the sign's origin. This is, of course, not a very
good idea. Not only is the island inhabited by cannibals, but it is
also haunted by the living dead.<br><br>One of the classic Italian splatter flicks, ""Zombi Holocaust"", is a fun
and entertaining, although not very thrilling movie, that mainly
concentrates on the enormous amounts of blood and gore and on constant
very graphical violence. The acting in this movie differs. As a huge
fan of Spaghetti Westerns, I found it cool to see Donal O'Brien, who
delivers a great performance as a mad scientist in this, in a
non-western role. The Italian and English title is maybe not the best
to describe the movie, since its the Cannibals, and not the Zombies who
kill the most people. The German title ""Zombies Unter Kannibalen""
(""Zombies Amongst Cannibals"") is probably better to describe the film's
content.<br><br>All things considered, ""Zombie Holocaust"" is a highly entertaining and
very bloody Gorefest that fans of the Cannibal subgenre should not
miss. Entertainment guaranteed!

Zombi Holocaust is a Cannible film, Zombie film and Mad scientist film
thrown together to make one really gory movie. Some scenes are similar
to Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2 such as it starts in New York and then they go
into the tropical island, the Zombies in the island's church. Even two
of the actors from Zombi 2 are in Zombi Holocaust.<br><br>The scenes with the Cannibles killing and eating the people are nice
and gory, the Zombie make up is good and kind of similar to Zombi 2's
Zombie make up. One problem is that we don't see much of the Zombies at
first but halfway through the film they do show up.<br><br>The Mad Scientist elements are something new since Zombi 2 didn't have
a man trying to create Zombies for his research and uses the Cannibles
for his experiments. Zombi Holocaust is a great Zombie flick with some
good gore effects. Check this out.

Dr. Obrero (Dan O' Brien) is experimenting on corpses on a remote
Island. Well, an expedition team (which includes Zombi 2's Ian
McCulloch) ends up on the island-and runs into the Docotor, who has
some plans-as well as cannibals and zombies-in store for them.<br><br>Titled ""Dr Butcher M.D."" when it came to video in the 80's, ""Zombie
Holocaust"" is an interesting-and fun-blend of two different kinds of
Italian Gore flicks: The Italian Zombie movie, and the Italian Cannibal
movie-only without any of the animal torture and mutilation of the
later.<br><br>The movie has some nice gore (surgical and otherwise-including an
awesome motorboat engine to the head death) and nudity to liven things
up, as well as a fun score and tons of camp. Also, unlike other Italian
gore flicks of the time, the movie features a little intentional humor
to go with it (""The patients screaming disturbed me, performed removal
of vocal chords""-that line always gets me), which after the downbeat
feeling of Fulci's zombie movies, is something of a breath of undead
air. It's nice to see an Italian gore flick that doesn't take itself
too seriously for a change.<br><br>If there is any problem, it's that the zombie aspect feels rather
underplayed, as they aren't used for much. Sure, there's that
aforementioned death by boat motor, but they don't do a whole lot to
threaten the team, as the cannibals are more of a threat. Still,
""Zombie Holocaust"" is a blast of exploitation that fans of over the top
Italian Horror might enjoy. I know I did.

Zombie Holocaust (aka Dr. Butcher MD Medical Deviate in the United
States) is a film that capitalizes on the success of the now cult
classic cannibal and zombie films of the late 70's and early 80's such
as Zombi 2, Cannibal Ferox, and Burial Ground etc. The movie begins
with a mysterious man stealing body parts from cadavers in a New York
hospital for a ""late night snack."" What is with these Italian zombie
films and New York connections anyways? The man is eventually
discovered and promptly flings himself out of the hospital window
before anyone can question him. Upon investigating his body we discover
that he bears markings that link him to a native cannibal tribe on an
island off of the South American coast (here we go again) and our leads
are sent to investigate. Ian McCulloch (of Zombi 2 fame) plays Dr.
Peter Chandler (Peter...also in Zombi 2...weird) and reprises his role
as a zombie slayer and travels with anthropologist and medical student
Lori Ridgeway (Alexandra Delli Colli) to the island to meet with Dr.
Obrero (Donald O'Brien) whose questionable character leads to an
interesting twist in the movies latter half. Upoon our characters
arrival at the island they encounter cannibal mayhem, zombie carnage,
and some crazy doctor antics that make for the aforementioned twist.<br><br>Zombie Holocaust falls into one of my favorite categories,
Euro-zombie-trash! These movies usually contain an overabundance of
gore, nudity, bad acting, and a plot with enough holes to embarrass a
slice of Swiss. Zombie Holocaust does not let down in any of these
categories except acting; the acting here is fairly solid. GO IAN! The
movie was released in America as Dr. Butcher MD as mentioned above and
it contains a different opening. Despite common belief, that is the
ONLY significant difference between the two films. The Dr. Butcher
version contains an R rating but does not lack any of the gore in the
Zombie Holocaust version. The Euro-cut is superior to me only because
A) it is the original, and B) because the introduction spoils the whole
zombie revealing that remains kind of mysterious in Zombie Holocaust
until about halfway through the movie. You find yourself wondering how
the will fit in them BAM! There they are. Things to look forward to in
Zombie Holocaust include some really well done gore scenes including
some eyes being ripped out and eaten, graphic disembowelments, a
machete to the head, some likely unsanitary surgeries, and the
grand-daddy of them all here, an running outboard boat engine propeller
to the head of an attacking zombie! Oh... and the nudity, there is
plenty of that! <br><br>The version of the movie that I own comes from Shriek Show (a division
of Media Blasters) and has both crisp image and sound, despite the
atrocious dubbing! I still don't understand why we can't just get the
original language tracks with English subtitles!? The movie came as
part of the highly recommended Zombie Pack 2 (along with Burial Ground:
The Nights of Terror and Flesh Eater). Shriek Show, as usual, packed
this one with extras including both American and German trailers, an
extensive poster and still gallery, an interview with the EFX director,
the opening segments of the US release with commentary, and a slew of
trailers for other zombie and cannibals flicks of the era. This movie
is something that any true zombie/cannibal aficionado should have in
there collection. It is comparable to Zombi 2, so don't be surprised if
some of the zombies or the sets look the same.<br><br>Overall, if you are a fan of zombies, cannibals, Ian McCulloch, extreme
gore, movies with mad scientists/doctors, or a combination thereof, you
should check this out. An overall excellent flick in my opinion.

His parents were both of half Welsh and half English descent. Influenced by Richard Burton, he decided to study at College of Music and Drama and graduated in 1957. In 1965, he moved to London and joined the National Theatre, invited by Laurence Olivier, who could see the talent in Hopkins. In 1967, he made his first film for television, A Flea in Her Ear (1967).From this moment on, he enjoyed a successful career in cinema and television. In 1968, he worked on The Lion in Winter (1968) with Timothy Dalton. Many successes came later, and Hopkins\' remarkable acting style reached the four corners of the world. In 1977, he appeared in two major films: A Bridge Too Far (1977) with James Caan, Gene Hackman, Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Elliott Gould and Laurence Olivier, and Maximilian Schell. In 1980, he worked on The Elephant Man (1980). Two good television literature adaptations followed: Othello (1981) and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1982). In 1987 he was awarded with the Commander of the order of the British Empire. This year was also important in his cinematic life, with 84 Charing Cross Road (1987), acclaimed by specialists.

Hopkins also notes that Hannibal never blinked his eyes when he spoke.      10/97: Ranked #57 in Empire (UK) magazine\'s ""The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time"" list.

One such segment has Laurence Olivier, in the role of Marcus Crassus, attempting to seduce the slave Antoninus (played by Tony Curtis). But the original soundtrack for this segment had become lost. And so, Olivier having died in 1989, Anthony Hopkins imitated the voice of Olivier (whom Hopkins had understudied at the Old Vic) for the scene\'s re-created soundtrack. (The surviving Tony Curtis presumably supplied his own voice.)      Born at 9:15am-UT      One of his greatest pleasures in past years on his frequent visits to the USA was to get in a car and drive across the country, enjoying its immensity as well as his own anonymity.      9/99: Was selected by an Entertainment Weekly on-line movie poll as the Best Modern Actor and the Best Villain for his role as Hannibal Lecter.      4/12/00: Became a U.S. citizen, but is allowed to retain his British knighthood and the title of Sir.

For his stage performance in ""Pravda"", he was awarded the 1985 London Critics Circle Theatre Award (Drama Theatre Award) for Best Actor, and the Laurence Olivier Theatre Award in 1986 (1985 season) for Outstanding Achievement.      He chose to play Prof. Van Helsing in Dracula (1992) because he was still riding the success of his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and wanted to pick a role as far removed from Lecter as possible.      His Oscar-winning performance as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs (1991) was ranked #1 on the American Film Institute\'s Villains list in its compilation of the 100 Years of The Greatest Screen Heroes and Villains.      As a child, he was very close to his maternal grandfather, who for some reason called him ""George"", while his father called him ""Charlie"".      Is related to the poet William Butler Yeats on his mother\'s side of the family.      He included some unusual touches for Hannibal Lecter during his preparation for the role, among which were making Lecter\'s voice similar to the cutting warble of Katharine Hepburn and almost never blinking, a characteristic he picked up from watching tapes of convicted murderer Charles Manson.      Has played a (future) king of England (Richard Lionheart in The Lion in Winter (1968)) and two U.S. Presidents. Interestingly, President Richard Nixon and his brothers were all named after British kings, so it\'s likely that he played Nixon\'s namesake.      A Member of the RADA Council.      Has three roles in common with Brian Cox. Both of them have played Titus Andronicus. Hopkins appeared on stage as King Lear in 1986, the same year that Manhunter (1986), which starred Cox as Hannibal Lecter, was released. He was succeeded in the role of Lear by Cox in 1991, the same year that he succeeded Cox in the role of Hannibal Lecter.      Graduated from The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, London, England.

He was suggested in the Worst Supporting Actor category for his performance in the film Alexander (2004), however, he failed to receive a nomination. Had he gotten the nomination, it would have been his first in 24 years. He was previously nominated for Worst Actor in the film A Change of Seasons (1980) at the very first Razzie Awards.      Ranked #12 on Tropopkin\'s Top 25 Most Intriguing People [Issue #100]      Has the distinction of twice playing former British Prime Minister David Lloyd George in Young Winston (1972) and The Edwardians (1972).      In Invercargill, New Zealand, there is a drama school named after him--The Anthony Hopkins School of Dramatic Arts. He was present for its opening, as he was in Invercargill filming scenes for the The World\'s Fastest Indian (2005) at the time.      Though dyslexic, he\'s always possessed a great memory for scripts.      9/20/05: On The Oprah Winfrey Show (1986), he said that he is most proud of The Silence of the Lambs (1991), The Remains of the Day (1993) and Proof (2005).

During filming of Amistad (1997), he astounded the cast and crew by memorizing a seven page speech in one go. Steven Spielberg was so impressed that he insisted on calling him ""Sir Anthony"" throughout the shoot rather than Tony.      He has played Pablo Picasso, while his friend and frequent collaborator, Richard Attenborough, is an avid collector of Picasso\'s artwork.      His early ambition was to be a concert pianist.      His father was a baker.      Turned down the role of George Smiley in A Murder of Quality (1991).      His parents were of half Welsh and half English descent. His paternal grandfather, Richard Arthur Thomas Hopkins, and his maternal grandmother, Sophia Phillips, were Welsh. His paternal grandmother, Emma Gardner, and his maternal grandfather, Thomas Frederick Yeates, were both English.      He is filming The City of Your Final Destination (2009) in Argentina, during December 2006 - January 2007. [December 2006]      Pledged $1.6 million to help preserve 4,000 acres of Mt. Snowdon, Wales\' highest peak.      As of 2014, has appeared in five films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: The Lion in Winter (1968), The Elephant Man (1980), The Silence of the Lambs (1991) - which won in the category, Howards End (1992) and The Remains of the Day (1993).      He gave life to many historical figures in many movies and miniseries from presidents to writers and military leaders. His gallery of characters includes Alfred Hitchcock, Richard Nixon, John Quincy Adams, Charles Dickens, Adolf Hitler, Yitzhak Rabin, Pablo Picasso, Bruno Richard Hauptmann, David Lloyd George, Frederick Treves, Lieutenant Colonel Frost, Lieutenant William Bligh, Frank P. Doel, C.S. Lewis, Count Galeazzo Ciano, John Harvey Kellogg and Burt Munro.      He has been wanted very much in the James Bond franchise. First, he was in talks to play a villain in Timothy Dalton\'s unmade third film. Then he was the first choice of the villains in both Goldeneye (1995) and Tomorrow Never Dies (1997). Then he was rumored for Albert Finney\'s role in Skyfall (2012).      In 1997 he was named to star in \'The Ripper Diaries\' to be directed by William Friedkin but in the June it was announced that the film had been put on hold.      He has two roles in common with Frank Langella, who is only one day his junior: (1) Langella played Don Diego de la Vega / Zorro in The Mark of Zorro (1974) while Hopkins played him in The Mask of Zorro (1998) and (2) Hopkins played U.S. President Richard Nixon in Nixon (1995) while Langella played him in Frost/Nixon (2008). Both actors also appeared in adaptations of Bram Stoker\'s 1897 novel ""Dracula"": Langella played the title character in Dracula (1979) while Hopkins played his arch-enemy Professor Abraham Van Helsing in Dracula (1992).      He appeared in four films with Gerald Sim: Young Winston (1972), A Bridge Too Far (1977), Chaplin (1992) and Shadowlands (1993). All four films were directed by Sim\'s brother-in-law Richard Attenborough.      Although he played Nicol Williamson\'s uncle in Hamlet (1969), he was fourteen months his junior.      He appeared in five films directed by Richard Attenborough: Young Winston (1972), A Bridge Too Far (1977), Magic (1978), Chaplin (1992) and Shadowlands (1993).      Was offered the lead role in Gandhi (1982) by Richard Attenborough. When Hopkins called his father to tell him, his father responded with: ""Oh, its a comedy then is it!?"".      Graduated from the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardiff.      He appeared in three films with Anne Bancroft: Young Winston (1972), The Elephant Man (1980) and 84 Charing Cross Road (1987).      He has worked with 12 directors who have won an Oscar for Best Director: Tony Richardson, Richard Attenborough, Robert Wise, Michael Cimino, Jonathan Demme, Francis Ford Coppola, John Schlesinger, Oliver Stone, Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard, Robert Zemeckis, and Woody Allen.      Starred with Bob Hoskins in the BBC\'s Othello. Anthony Hopkins and Bob Hoskins are two actors separated by one letter.      Has played a doctor twice: The Elephant Man (1980) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991).      In 1964 Hopkins composed a waltz named ""And The Waltz Goes On"", but he kept it in a drawer for many years until his wife contacted Dutch violinist and conductor Andre Rieu in 2010. Rieu arranged the piece and it premiered in Vienna in 2011 in the presence of Anthony Hopkins. Rieu included the waltz in his playlist for his next tour and produced a CD named after the waltz.Personal Quotes (70)      [on Gary Oldman] He is just like I was at his age.      I was lousy in school. Real screwed-up. A moron. I was antisocial and didn\'t bother with the other kids. A really bad student. I didn\'t have any brains. I didn\'t know what I was doing there. That\'s why I became an actor.      [Interviewed on Inside the Actors Studio (1994)] I once asked a Jesuit priest what was the best short prayer he knew. He said, ""Fuck it,\' as in, ""Fuck it; it\'s in God\'s hands.""      The Welsh people have a talent for acting that one does not find in the English. The English lack heart.      [December 1998] To hell with this stupid show business, this ridiculous showbiz, this futile waste of life. I look back and see a desert wasteland. All those years spent in a fake environment. Everything was a fake.      [on becoming a U.S. citizen in 2000] America has been very generous to me, magnanimous really. I thought it would be good to give something back. It was a decision of the heart.      [on his days as an alcoholic, when he was drinking Mexican Spirit tequila] I was really sort of on a prolonged acid trip. I saw things and had peculiar quasi-religious experiences. I thought I was John The Baptist, and I would talk to the sea at Malibu and the sea would talk back to me. It was weird.      [on his most famous character, Dr. Hannibal Lecter] I think he might be a very interesting person to have lunch with, provided that YOU weren\'t the lunch.      One of the people I got to know years ago, which was a great privilege, was Laurence Olivier. He was like a laser - that was his power. And the only actor I\'ve met since who had that same quality of laser-like determination is Russell Crowe. The first day I started working with him, I thought, ""That guy\'s got it."" The best way to describe Russell is, he\'s like a shark circling round. He was argumentative. He argued with the director all the time. I don\'t know Russell that well, but I admire him, and you know, whatever he\'s got to do really. I really like him because he\'s ballsy, he\'s got guts, he\'s macho and all the rest of it. He\'s going through his bad boy period, but he\'s basically a nice guy.      I am able to play monsters well. I understand monsters. I understand madmen.      Being a smoker is like being trapped in a complicated maze. It\'s as if Allen Carr has a plan of the maze. Instantly I was freed from my addiction.      Acting is still enjoyable, but there are no more challenges any more for me. No, none at all. I\'m much more interested in painting and composing music these days. I\'ve become what I always wanted to be, a jobbing actor. I\'m just detached, I do my thing. I work hard at it, but I don\'t invest my life in it. As long as they pay me on time and I get a good script with a good director, I have fun. That\'s all.      [on former US President Bill Clinton] It seems to me that the country rather misses him. He has impressed me. He asked me if I wanted to accompany him on a trip to Brazil, and so off I went. I\'d met the President before in Washington, a very nice guy. So we were at this dinner, talking after his gig, he gave this incredible speech and he said, ""Would you like to come to Brazil with me next week?"". Of course I said, ""Yes"". He\'s pretty exhausting to be with, because he\'s always wanting to play cards or golf.      Heroes, like Bogart (Humphrey Bogart). They deserve high definition.      I think the first British actor who really worked well in cinema was Albert Finney. He was a back-street Marlon Brando. He brought a great wittiness and power to the screen. The best actor we\'ve had.      I\'ve done some good films. The Remains of the Day (1993) was alright. The Silence of the Lambs (1991). Nixon (1995) I enjoyed. One of my favourites was working with Roger Donaldson on The World\'s Fastest Indian (2005). That was fun and seems to be quite popular. It is wonderful to have reached that point where I can do what grabs my attention, when I want to. I\'m glad those days are gone where I was yearning for work. People think I\'ve worked a lot, but I haven\'t. I\'ve had a lot of time off. I\'ve turned down a lot. When you\'re younger you want to get every part to stop other people getting it. Nowadays, I don\'t care - let them do it. I don\'t go through that terrible thing of thinking, ""If I don\'t do it, then who\'s going to get to do it?"" I just mosey my way through and see what happens.      [on Oliver Stone] Oh, Oliver\'s crazy, but I like him. He\'s very rude to people. He insults people - he insults me - but you just have to give it back. He says to me, ""Oh, you\'re getting old."" So you shoot back with, ""Yeah, so are you. You\'re getting bald, too. You\'ve aged, you\'re getting balder. Actually, you look older than me, Oliver. It\'s no good dying your hair like that."" But he\'s good. He\'s a very talented man. He can be a bit exhausting. I did about 18 hours on Alexander (2004). I never saw it. I understand it wasn\'t very good. I did 18 hours one night out in Borehamwood and thought, ""No, that\'s it."" Had a long rest after that.      [on David Lynch] I wrote him a letter not so long ago because I\'d seen The Elephant Man (1980) again. I wrote him a letter to apologise for my bad behaviour on that film. I was terribly behaved and very rebellious. He wanted to do too many takes and I couldn\'t do it. And he was a little remote and I could never understand what he was talking about which made me very irritable. I haven\'t seen him for years but he\'s a smart man, a very daring figure. I like David very much. Brilliant, I think.      My own father was a tough man. He was a pretty red hot guy but he was also cold. He was also slightly disappointed in me because I was not a good kid as a school boy, you know. But I learned from it, I liked that coldness, because it was harsh. And he taught me to be tough. So I know how to be tough. I know how to be strong. I know how to be ruthless. It\'s part of my nature. I wouldn\'t be an actor if I wasn\'t.      It\'s fun to get the Oscar, it was fun to get a knighthood. But you know, you wake up in the morning, the reality\'s still there. You\'re still mortal.      The movie industry is full of crazy people who think that they are God.      How do you play Hannibal Lecter? Well just don\'t move. Scare people by being still.      I\'d been to the dentist, and I was seven years old, to have a tooth taken out. In those days they yanked it out. I was feeling nauseous and I hallucinated. I was in bed and I remember waking up with a knock at the door - a box was put in my bedroom. And it was full of encyclopedias, which my father had got me. I remember looking through those books and finding a knowledge. I learned everything I could.      For many, many years I felt like I didn\'t belong. I was a duffer at school - everything was incomprehensible to me.      I was an only child. My mother married into a family of in-laws. She felt like an outsider; which she was. She was a powerful force in my father\'s life. He was a baker - and she was ambitious for him. She didn\'t want him to be subservient to his father. She woke him up.      [on meeting his third wife, Stella Arroyave, a Colombian-born antiques dealer]: I married a remarkable woman who has changed a lot of my perception about myself and about life. She\'s very positive, very powerful. Every time I get a negative thought, she says, \'Cancel it\'.      Once you accept the fact that there\'s nothing to fear, you drill into the primal oil well. I believe when we do things without fear, we can do anything. As long as you don\'t worry about the consequences.      [Twenty-three years after asking Burton for an autograph, Hopkins was on Broadway in Equus (1977). Burton was taking over the role from Hopkins, who asked to see him backstage: ""He was about to go on stage and he said, \'Why haven\'t we worked together? You come from Taibach\'. That\'s the only time I met him again.      It\'s nice to get a knighthood but in the end it\'s just the same old face in the mirror getting older and older - you have to shave every morning and you look at your face and think: this is it, this is the deal. And there\'s a wonderful harsh reality about that. Time is going by. I better get on with it. I better live.      I became an actor but I still don\'t feel that I\'m a part of this profession. I never have - 50 years I\'ve been doing it.      [on working with Woody Allen on You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (2010): ""I wasn\'t sure how he would be - I\'d heard stories that he was aloof. Woody says \'Okay, you come in through the door - let\'s rehearse it. Okay, that\'s good. Sure. Let\'s shoot it\'. So we shoot it. \'Okay, very good. But improvise\'.""      [on British humour]: It\'s like Jewish humour. I love that.      We live in such a precious, pussyfooting society - everyone takes offence so quickly.      [He did try therapy, briefly, but didn\'t like it]: Well, you know you never actually fess up to everything - you try to cover your ground, cover your tracks - you want to sound interesting. Living here [in Los Angeles] - all men must cry. Well, I don\'t think we\'re wired that way. I think it\'s okay to express emotions and grief, but to make a habit of it, this endless psychobabble in our culture - everyone goes on The Oprah Winfrey Show (1986) and Dr. Phil (2002) - it makes me want to throw up. I mean, come on!      When I break with a friend it is sudden. I will give no warning ahead of time, just change my address and telephone number. They may be confused - but they\'ll survive. Nobody dies.      I was told years ago that I suffer from \'terminal reasonableness\'. From that point on I thought that was something to work on. Not to become a son of a bitch, but to say no. Now, after all these years, I can say: \'What part of the word \'no\' do you not understand?\'      I don\'t want to be anything else other than what I am. I can say that with passion. No regrets.      There\'s an epitaph on my mother\'s grave - I brought her over years ago and she\'s buried up in the Hollywood Hills - from a poem written in 1896 by Ernest Dowson: \'They are not long, the days of wine and roses: Out of a misty dream / Our path emerges for a while, then closes / Within a dream.\' Isn\'t that beautiful?      [At age 72]: I\'m not getting the parts I was 20 years ago - but I\'m still doing okay. The prospect of that blank wall where there\'s no more work - it doesn\'t fill me with dread.      I sometimes wake at night and I can hear the sea and I think: what the hell am I doing here? How did I get here?"" And I make no excuses. I say \'tough titty.\' Also \'TYFP\' - \'That\'s your f****** problem. \'      From the moment I made that decision [in 1975 to give up drinking] a very powerful thought shot into my brain - it\'s all over, now you can start living. It\'s extraordinary. That\'s what I\'m aware of today. The powerful spirit in me. I\'m not callous. It\'s expediency. I will not be taken for a fool any more.      I may sound to you like a really hard man - I am not ashamed of it at all. I\'m not hard, I\'m honest.      [on paintings he has done] I suppose I could call them primitive because again, as I have no academic training, I could no longer sit in an art class drawing apples or vases or nudes - I can\'t feel hemmed in.      [on acting} I\'m not going to turn my back on it until they tell me it\'s over and we don\'t want you anymore. So if they say they want me I will go ahead and do it, learn my lines. You know, do what I do. So it\'s the best time of my life now.      Beware the tyranny of the weak. They just suck you dry. They\'re always complaining. I go, ""How are you doing?"" They say ""Ahh..."" and they moan and try to take from you. I know a number of people like that, but I can\'t waste my time on them.      Over the years I worked with a couple of younger actors who reminded me of myself. I like bad boys. I worked with Russell Crowe in Australia before he became a star. Russell is a bad boy. I think he is terrific. Richard Burton was a bad boy, but he shook the rafters of the world. I think it is good to be bad - I was bad all my life. I still am.      On Peter O\'Toole: I had some bizarre nights with Peter when we made The Lion in Winter (1968), but to be honest I don\'t remember them. He enjoyed his drink - and I did, too. We weren\'t close friends or anything but we got drunk very quickly and there was always amusement and laughter. I love drunks; they are terrific - except when they throw up on you.      I hated the Sixties. It was one long wet Wednesday afternoon in the Waterloo Road. For most of it I was drinking myself into oblivion.      We like to look into the dark side of ourselves and I think that causes us great fascination and fear. That\'s why people like Hannibal Lecter. He was a man caught in a monstrous mind.      I\'ve got no problem if people want to spend hours beforehand preparing before they come on-set, as long as they don\'t keep you waiting. And I\'ve read Stanislavski and did the Method myself, and all that, but now I\'ve simplified it: learn your lines, show up, and get on with it.      [on Laurence Olivier] He was a pretty colorful personality. He had tremendous drive, and ambition, and was a real force. A very nice guy and a titanic talent. His sort of talent has, in the eyes of cynics, become rather unfashionable. There are people who knock Olivier quite often, but not a single one of them could ever touch him in terms of talent. I thought he was an extraordinary man.      [on playing Hannibal Lecter for the third time in Red Dragon (2002)] I really wanted to play him with much more ferocious energy, and avoid the jokes. I really wanted to show what a true monster he is. He\'s a killer. He\'s a dangerous man, not Mr. Cutesy. This isn\'t a franchise, like Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). This is a dangerous man, who\'s better off in jail. So that\'s the premise we went with.      I\'m not good at being cooped up with anyone for very long. Maybe that\'s why I wasn\'t designed for marriage. I\'m not good at any kind of relationship with people, really. I mean, I\'ve had a number of good ones, but I get restless and I take off.      [on Richard Attenborough] Richard\'s a nice guy, very persuasive, a great salesman in the sense that he gets what he wants from you. He can charm a lot of people. He\'s a good man. I haven\'t seen him for a long time.      You know when some of these megaphones of Hollywood show up on these award shows, and just never shut the f**k up? I just want to say \'Accept your award. Say ""thank you,"" and get off!\' I\'m just not interested in all that bulls**t. There are surgeons and nurses and teachers, people out there who really deserve awards.      [on The Silence of the Lambs (1991)] As soon as I saw that script I knew this was one of those special parts. I don\'t know why, it\'s just an instinct. I\'d never heard of the book. I\'d never heard of Thomas Harris. I read the script and they told me Jonathan Demme was doing it - I\'d never heard of him, either. So I watched Married to the Mob (1988) and Something Wild (1986), which I thought was a terrific film. And we had the great cast: Jodie Foster. I knew it was something good. That was the only surefire one where I knew it was going to work. I remember my first meeting with Jodie in New York, for a reading of the whole script. Jodie had just won the Oscar for The Accused (1988) and I was kind of impressed at this wonderful young actor. I was a little intimidated, a little quiet, shy.....I didn\'t realise she felt the same!      [on Hannibal (2001)] They offered me the part and a very good salary, so I thought, ""Why not?"" First of all I didn\'t think I wanted to do it again, but then they said it was going off to Venice or wherever, so I watched The Silence of the Lambs (1991) briefly and thought, ""Okay, let\'s have another go at this."" I didn\'t care, really. If that\'s what they want, then okay. When Jodie [Foster] dropped out, Ridley [Scott] said to me, ""What do you think of certain actors?"" I said ""I think Julianne Moore is very, very good."" I\'d worked with her on Surviving Picasso (1996). And she pulled it off beautifully. If the film succeeded or not, I don\'t mind. You move on.      I went to America years ago because I felt I didn\'t fit in here [UK]. I worked with some good people here, like Judi Dench and all that. But I never fitted into a group of actors here. I was on the outside; I was like a sore thumb. I didn\'t have any friends who were actors at all - I never did. I\'ve always been on the outside, which is good. But it was difficult being on London in this very strange acting community. All that ""theatre, dahling"" - I just found it insufferable. It was just boring. So I did the thing I\'d wanted to do all my life, which was to make movies. I\'ve never felt a part of this profession, but I enjoy it. Working with Katharine Hepburn on The Lion in Winter (1968), she said to me, ""Don\'t act. Read the lines. Just be."" I said, ""Okay."" She said, ""Watch Spencer Tracy. He didn\'t act. He just spoke the lines."" I thought, ""Well, that\'s pretty good advice."" I think the actors from that generation were wonderful. They didn\'t act. They just came on and they did it, and the characters were wonderful. People say, ""They didn\'t act. They were always themselves."" Well, who else were they going to be? In England we have a tradition where everyone is acting. Too much acting.      We\'re living in a pretty strange time. I went into a shop to buy my wife some clothes. They had this big plasma screen on with these women on the catwalk. I thought, \'God Almighty, what have we become?\' These girls - anorexic, walking like machines, no soul. You look at fashion magazines and you think, \'What are we living in?\' You look at the red carpet, Paris Hilton, and you think, \'Is there anything going on up there?\' It\'s a mass enslavement, it\'s kind of fascism. It\'s the androgyny of the human soul. I don\'t think people think any more. Maybe I\'m just old.      [on Shirley MacLaine] The most obnoxious actress I\'ve ever worked with.      [on how he prepares for the characters he plays] I learn the text!      [on what his idea of a good night is] Staying in and watching Mob Wives on TV. I don\'t have many friends; I\'m very much a loner. As a child I was very isolated and I\'ve never been really close to anyone. Ask nothing, expect nothing. That\'s my creed. We\'re all just a bunch of sinners crashing around in the darkness.      [on what he considers his greatest achievement] Everything rather blends into one now. It was very nice to get an Oscar but now it just rusts and tarnishes on the sideboard near the TV. You can\'t take any of it too seriously. Death comes to us all. Not long ago I was in Arlington cemetery by JFK\'s grave and I thought how the great years of his presidency were just blown away like ashes. Nothing really is of any importance and there\'s a peace in that.      [on why he relocated to the U.S.] Many people talk of London as being the heart of the swinging 60s. It wasn\'t for me. What I remember is the grey mist hanging over the Waterloo Road on a Wednesday afternoon. It was so depressing I moved to the land of Donald Duck.      I\'ve never considered myself a great actor. I\'m a fluke. I work hard and I see through the bastards and to this day I have massive energy; I think it keeps a youthfulness in me. I never slow down because I love to work. I did four films last year. My agent says, \'Would you like to read the phone book next week for them [directors]?\' And I say, \'Yeah OK.\'      I was away for a few weeks in a hotel watching new releases. Some I had to switch off after eight minutes. I couldn\'t understand what anyone was saying.      [on Marlon Brando] He was fascinating to watch, he could do anything. It was the \'screw you\' attitude. That takes tremendous courage or tremendous folly.      My philosophy is: It\'s none of my business what people say of me and think of me. I am what an am, and I do what I do. I expect nothing and accept everything. And it makes like so much easier.      I think ""I\'m glad I\'ve made a good film, because now I can make a bad one!""      I\'m often asked to do projects. If I don\'t want to do something, after a while I\'ll say ""No. What part of No don\'t you understand?""Salary (4)Mission: Impossible II\xa0(2000)      $5,000,000       Hannibal\xa0(2001)      $15,000,000       Red Dragon\xa0(2002)      $20,000,000       The Wolfman\xa0(2010)      $15,000,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nChris Rock ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 115 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(3)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(35)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(68)\xa0|Salary\xa0(3)  Overview (4)Date of Birth7\xa0February1965,\xa0Andrews, South Carolina, USA Birth NameChristopher Julius Rock IIINicknameChrissy    Height5\'\xa010""\xa0(1.78\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Christopher Julius Rock was born in Andrews, South Carolina and raised in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York.

Hosted The 77th Annual Academy Awards (2005) on February 27, 2005, and, despite concerns over the content of his monologue, he mostly kept this clean.      Has the rare distinction of being in two movies that opened on the same day in the United States: The Longest Yard (2005) and Madagascar (2005) (May 27, 2005).

Jim Carrey looks like he\'s in pretty good shape, but traditionally, funny guys have never been buff. Why do people do yoga? It clears their minds. I embrace the clutter in my head. I like it. What funny guy\'s got it all together?      I love music. Music is the soundtrack to the crappy movie that is my life.      It\'s my real name. My mother\'s name is Rose Rock. It was the worst name as a kid to have. They called me Piece of the Rock, Plymouth Rock, Joe Rockid, and Flintstones. Now they call me Mister Rock.      A man is basically as faithful as his options.      I\'m never proper or careful, but I never curse in front of my mother, either.      How do I say this without sounding like an egomaniac? I don\'t know a comedian that sells more seats than me in the red states and blue states, so I don\'t see where I have to change that much.      I like the tradition of the Oscars. I like that some of the greatest comedians ever have hosted the show.      Hollywood\'s just not funny. You walk around and think \'Where\'s the funny at?\' It\'s not there - all there is is a bunch of directors and actors walking around. I like going into a diner and meeting real people. Funny is where the real people are.      I never wanted to churn it out. Comedians tend to work all the time. They never put it down like musicians who might make an album then take three or four years off to recharge their batteries. Comedians tend to work straight through and they get stale because of that. Even when I didn\'t have a lot of money I never ever did it unless I had something new to say.      People want comedians to be funny. I mean I love Jim Carrey in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) but it ain\'t a better performance than in Dumb and Dumber (1994). I can do serious roles sometimes in other people\'s movies but not in one of my own. I don\'t wanna ask my fans to come and not laugh at me: ""Hey! Come on, let\'s go see Chris Rock not be funny!"".      America is the most powerful country in the world and I think every intelligent country should be concerned about what\'s going on here. I\'ve got no beef with Brits objecting to our election outcome. I applaud that. I\'ll tell you right now, Americans don\'t care about what\'s going on in other countries.      I always say about my daughters, they save me from my miserable self. They take me out, you know, a comedian, you could live in your head a lot. And you\'re writing and you\'re doubting. But when I\'m with my kids and my family, it\'s all about them.      Now that I have children, I realize taking care of my children is more fun than anything in the whole world.      I don\'t write jokes first. I write down topics. I think of what I want to talk about, and then I write the jokes -- they don\'t write me... And even if you don\'t think it\'s funny, you won\'t think it\'s boring. You might disagree, but you\'ll listen. And maybe even laugh as you disagree.      You know, just right place right time, lucked up. Thank God for animation. I can turn down a lot of movies now.      I\'m a nerd. I\'m a little guy... the last guy you\'d expect in a romantic movie.      Guys play characters that won\'t grow up and something catastrophic happens and they have to grow up to save the day -- that\'s pretty much what today\'s comedy is about,      The best part is just having a partner. There is no real worst part. I\'m not going to say there\'s a worst part. I mean I\'m a comedian - comedians like to work alone. So maybe I\'m not the ideal guy to be married to, in that sense.      I\'ve been married for 10 years and, you know, it\'s hard, you spruce it up and you go places. How do you spruce up anything? Artificially. You go places and do things.      I love having somebody there - that companion thing. You know who you\'re going to eat with, who you\'re going to see a movie with.      I\'m more patient. I\'m less of a recluse. I\'ve been on TV for a long freaking time, and it can definitely isolate you. You get to where you only have things in common with people in the business, and kids open you up to a new world. You have something in common with just about everybody. I think I\'m a better artist. Everything I\'ve done since I\'ve had kids is better than the stuff I did before I had kids.      I\'m happy if everybody else is. I\'m a big brother, the oldest. If you\'re happy and I\'m not, I\'m cool with that. If I\'m happy and you\'re not, I\'m sad.      I used to watch my father go to work every day and come home and be so beat. We had seven kids. I always wondered what he really wanted to do. Now that I\'m older and have my own kids, I realize there\'s nothing better than to work for your kids. I\'m sure he got more gratification from his work than I do. My father was feeding his kids every week, paying the heating bills. If he didn\'t work, then it didn\'t get done. There\'s a tremendous amount of gratification from that. And a tremendous amount of pressure, too.      If you live with a single parent, you don\'t see compromise. You witness a grown person living in a world where they do what they want to do. When you are raised by two parents, you are constantly watching compromise take place. Just by observing that, it made me a better person.      All people naturally hate. My kid bites people now. I didn\'t teach my kid to bite anybody. Kids say mean stuff. Only through love do we get this evil out of them. Only through love and structure and discipline do they not hate. The kids that hate didn\'t learn anything, that\'s the problem.      I always say there\'s no more little girls, just boys with (breasts). Girls act like boys nowadays. Teenage girls, they go after boys. They\'re predatory just like boys. My goal is to keep my girls, girls.      I\'m like the Hulk on stage. It\'s way over the top. That\'s Bizarro Chris. Sometimes I get off stage and go ""What did I say?!"" I\'ll watch one of my [stand-up] specials a year later and go ""Eww, that was mean"".      I love my life, but I don\'t think I\'m any happier than my younger brother Andre, who drives a garbage truck.      It\'s weird with stand-up comedy. It doesn\'t really translate worldwide. I want to figure out how do I make it worldwide. Do a special in Africa. Can\'t beat that. Pull that off, then I will have done something.      I\'m a rap comedian the same way Bill Cosby is a jazz comedian, Cosby\'s laid back. I\'m like, bang, bang bang, right into it.      I just remember that whenever I got really mad or passionate, like in an argument, people would laugh, and I\'d be dead serious. It would happen a lot. So it was like ""Gee, I\'ve got something here."".      The material comes from whenever you realize that you and someone else have something in common. So any conversation you\'ve had more than once, anything you see happening to you that you see happening to a friend, you go, ""Hmmm, that\'s a situation I can make funny."".      I was raised to believe that you had to do things better than white people in order to succeed. The old black shows were better than the white shows. The Jeffersons (1975) was a lot better. Good Times (1974) was way funnier. Sanford and Son (1972). Now, though, everyone thinks we\'re equal, so we submit the same shit that everyone else submits. And then we get mad when they won\'t air it. You got to go back to the old attitude of it has to be twice as good.      I like talking about subjects that aren\'t funny in the first place and making them funny. So anything down and depressing is something I\'ll talk about.      Women would rule the world - if only they\'d stop bitchin\' about each other.      I don\'t think my comedy is that political. It\'s more social. But whatever. When you make comedy and you do stand-up, you work alone. Movies have to go under so much scrutiny. A stand-up special is a vision, and a movie is a consensus in a lot of ways.      It\'s no different. It\'s not like I ever cursed around my mother or anything. I never had a hard time turning it on and off. It\'s like you enter another country - sometimes you\'re in a cursing country and then you\'re in a kid\'s country.      At home, [we play] a lot of Disney stuff -- _Raven [Raven-Symoné],High School Musical (2006) soundtrack. My kids love Beyoncé Knowles, but there are a few songs I can\'t let them listen to -- they\'re so materialistic! They\'re all about chinchilla coats and BBS Slims [cell phone]. I\'d rather have them listening to a protest song!      I think if I were to get as big as I could get, it does change your mind-state. I think like the little man. I think like the underdog. I don\'t want to change that.      There\'s no interference in stand-up. It\'s all the things it\'s hard to get in film: I get to have a wife, I get to have kids. I get to be sexual. I get to grow. I get to be a man.      I shouldn\'t be able at this late date to go into a club and be better than guys who are there every night. Nobody really wants to be a stand-up, they want to get on TV. Everybody wants to be Seinfeld (1989), nobody wants to be Jerry Seinfeld.      You want to track Hollywood careers, look in the real estate section. You see a guy buy a house that costs $6 million, and you can literally start counting the days until he starts doing crappy movies.      [on _Head of State (2003)_ ()] I was directing it for the wrong reasons, maybe out of fear.      It\'s the worst script I\'ve ever gotten. The rap group was called Nubian Nation Pussy Patrol! I\'d have been happier getting an envelope full of anthrax. - on receiving the script for Marci X (2003).      Nobody\'s good. I hate it. I truly hate it. I mean, there\'s a lot of guys doing stuff I admire, but stand-up-wise I feel very alone. I really miss [Bill] Hicks. I wish I could have put him on my show. And I really miss Sam [Kinison] a lot. Richard [Pryor]\'s sick... It\'s like you get here and then, oh wait a minute, there\'s nobody here any more. I feel like the guy who finally got into Studio 54, three years too late, ""Duh, where are all the famous people?"".      The only reaction that frightens me is people not laughing. It\'s extraordinary to me when you get a laugh. That you can go in front of a bunch of people you never met before, you can say some stuff and they all laugh in unison - that\'s amazing. It\'s a miracle.      [on the success of Chris Rock: Bring the Pain (1996)] I thought, hopefully this will be better than other HBO specials, and I\'ll get whatever rewards come with that. Maybe somebody will want me to do a sitcom - if I\'m lucky. Next thing they were talking about it on C-Span, and I\'m like, Huh? My only goal was to do a show that was good enough that when I played a club, I wouldn\'t have to promote it on radio.      I think what kind of person you are during success is who you are. It\'s easy to be nice in failure and when you\'re broke - then you really need a lot of help from people. But after you win some money, that\'s the person you really are, because now you can be mean to people. You can act like an asshole. I\'ve seen people trip out again and again. A lot of times this behavior, when you\'re up, will determine if you get another shot someday, because things in this business always go down. I want them to say, ""He was a nice guy during the whole process. He never did the entourage thing."" Because that ain\'t funny. It\'s annoying.      [on being a black student in a predominately white school] My life was Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995). I would get beat up every day, called ""nigger"" and spit on. You get used to it. I couldn\'t fight back, I was so outnumbered, so I would just stand there and take it. The worst part is that, after a while, your spirit is broken. I\'d go to my parents and say, ""Take me out of here."" But they thought it was a better school. I guess it toughened me up.      For me, anything goes when I pick up a mike. I\'m not trying to hurt people - I try not to get too personal - but I look at myself as a reporter. If you can report on anything that has to do with pop culture, then why can\'t I make jokes about it? Yes, it hurts. But I figure that laughter sometimes starts from pain. You might wince, but then I know that I\'m doing my job. The only thing I can do wrong is not be funny.      I pride myself on being the guy who can do Def Comedy Jam (1992) and Charlie Rose (1991). And do well on both.      [on being compared to Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy] I\'m much closer to Mort Sahl and George Carlin and Sam Kinison... It is what it is.      [on Charles S. Dutton\'s criticism of Martin (1992)] Is Charles Dutton funny? Huh? At the end of the day, no. He\'s not. Charles Dutton is not as funny as Martin Lawrence. Now, I got nothing against Charles Dutton... but let\'s be truthful here. If Roc (1991) was funny, it would be on the air... But Charles Dutton is always preaching. How can you say someone has a negative image? You\'re A Murderer!      Every comedian has a moment in his life when he realizes he\'s a little bit different from everyone else. It\'s like being the only guy in a movie who sees the ghost. The ghost talks to you and you talk to him. Then you turn to your friend and say, ""Hey. Do you see that ghost?"" And he says, ""What ghost?""      [on his short-lived job at Red Lobster] The thing about Red Lobster is that if you work there, you can\'t afford to eat there. You\'re making minimum wage. A shrimp costs minimum wage. I cleaned up after the kids. Kids don\'t eat. I used to zero in on a kid. \'Don\'t touch that scallop. Please don\'t touch that scallop.\'      Nobody\'s about saving anymore. No one cares about a rainy day anymore. Nobody saves up enough for even an umbrella for a rainy day. It\'s sad. It really is a new form of slavery. We used to work to be able to afford material things. Now we work FOR these things. They\'re the boss. That house you can\'t afford, that car that\'s out of your price range, that cellphone that drains your bank account - that\'s your boss.      Dude, people love Grown Ups (2010). I don\'t care what the critics say. Who won the Academy Award this year? The Artist (2011)? Hey, ""The Artist"" was great. ""Grown Ups"" is better than ""The Artist"", and it\'s better than ""The Artist"" \'cause the audience says so. No film critic\'s going to say it, but ""Madagascar 3"" is better than ""The Artist,"" and it\'s better because it makes people feel better. That\'s ultimately what it boils down to. Carrot Top\'s better than Mort Sahl. Is he a better writer? Are we going to jot down Carrot Top\'s prose 100 years from now? I\'m not saying that. What I\'m saying is, Carrot Top makes people feel better than Mort Sahl ever made people feel.      [on Louis C.K.\'s late success] I feel like I\'m James Brown, and Jimi Hendrix was in my band. He was just some kid I used to beat up, and now he\'s back, and he\'s Jimi Hendrix. Is he better than me? I don\'t know, maybe. He used to write for so many people. ""I\'m going to L.A. and take some pitch meetings, write some shows."" Dude, write for yourself, I would constantly tell him. And some people are funny older than they are younger. Rodney Dangerfield was that. Redd Foxx was that - had careers as young people but when they got older, it was, like this guy\'s hysterical. And Louie, at 44, it\'s the sweet spot for him.      You know the world is going crazy when the best rapper is a white guy, the best golfer is a black guy, the tallest guy in the NBA is Chinese, the Swiss hold the America\'s Cup, France is accusing the U.S. of arrogance, Germany doesn\'t want to go to war, and the three most powerful men in America are named \'Bush\', \'Dick\' and \'Colon\'.      I was bused to a school in Gerritsen Beach in Brooklyn in 1972. I was one of the first black kids in the history of the school. There were parents with signs: NIGGER GO HOME. For all intents and purposes, the United States had been practicing apartheid until \'68. I was spit on every day. I had water balloons with piss thrown at me. I was fucking Carrie (1976).      I used to have horrible cars that would always end up broken down on the highway. When I tried to flag someone down, nobody stopped. But if I pushed my own car, other drivers would get out and push with me. If you want help, help yourself - people like to see that.      [on the Saturday Night Live (1975) sketch that got Chris Farley noticed] \'Chippendales\' was a weird sketch. I always hated it. The joke of it is, basically, \'We can\'t hire you because you\'re fat.\' There\'s no turn there. There\'s no comic twist to it. It\'s just fucking mean. A more mentally together Chris Farley wouldn\'t have done it, but Chris wanted so much to be liked. As funny as that sketch was and as many accolades as he got for it, it\'s one of the things that killed him. It really is. Something happened right then.      Does having a wife and kids change your life? Yes. but only in the best way. It gives you weight and authority. It also makes you closer to the audience because the audience is married and has kids. People without kids know nothing about kids. Jokes about your kids are always better than jokes about your brother\'s kids. Married guys know more about women than single guys. Single guys have girlfriends. Girlfriends are always auditioning, always on their best behavior. Wives are like Supreme Court justices - they do whatever the fuck they want.      [hosting the 2005 Academy Awards] Black movies don\'t have real names. They get names Iike \'Barbershop\'. That\'s not a name. That\'s just a location. Barbershop. Cookout. Car Wash. You know, Laundromat\'s coming soon. And after that, Check-Cashing Place.      I probably, I might be the only black comedian in the country who hasn\'t gay-bashed. Ever. Like ever, ever!      to the black students: you are black when you\'re black and in show business if you\'re not making history you\'re not making anything you\'re really not, your making history at every step every forward movement is history everything Eddie Murphy did was history the stuff Will Smith is doing right now is history I have been blessed with opportunities to do things that men so much better than me and so much smarter than me that never got the chance to do, to everybody else, show business is a hard job if it was easy everybody would be doing it and no one is entitled to any of it I\'m a pee on to what David Geffen can do or Jeffrey Katzenberg can do, when you\'re in show business Spielberg, Geffen, Bruckheimer and maybe four other people everybody\'s else is auditioning for the rest of their lives, I am auditioning I got a movie coming out right now and when that movie comes out I am officially unemployed and it don\'t mean nothing until I got something else coming out      [on hosting the Oscars] I didn\'t want to do it at first, they offered it to me a few times. I thought the risk was too big next to the rewards, but it was a conscious decision to have a big year. I also wanted to get some offers and stop writing movies, we ended up getting a high rating and it was fast show. There\'s no more pressure in show business than that first seven minutes of monologue, that is it, your whole life is on the line.      Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna\'s panties. I wasn\'t invited.

It\'s very strange. It\'s two hundred small villages linked together. Living here as compared to living in Tokyo, where I lived, or in London or New York, this is so much more like living in the country. You go to bed early and you get up early, even if you\'re not working. You get up early with the sun and go to bed with the sun. That is much more rural kind of living and it suits me so much better than New York."" - On Los Angeles.      ""I liked the way that film took realistic events and added this slightly out-of-kilter perspective. My character in that film was, in one sense, a caricature of a killer, but there was also a sense of mystery surrounding him that captured the imagination. Fargo (1996) was an exciting experience for me largely because of the approach the Coen brothers took. It was the antithesis of Armageddon (1998). It was low-budget, a very guerrilla-style approach to filmmaking that made its own rules and was very specific in what it was trying to accomplish."" --on Fargo (1996).      ""I was a foreigner, and I knew that most of the parts I would be offered would be foreigners. I knew I could not compete with Bruce Willis, Tom Cruise, and Nicolas Cage, and so I did not fight it. I saw the path I was destined to walk and decided to do the parts that would be offered to me as well as I possibly could."" --on his initial career outlook when he first came to the U.S. to act.      Upon receiving the Fargo (1996) script: ""Where are all my lines?!""      I\'ve done Hamlet, and no one talks about Hamlet killing five people. No one even talks about sending him to jail. And it\'s the same thing for a character like Abruzzi. I think people root for him because he\'s just punishing people who are bad humans in a way. Always in movies and TV, in drama we always root for those characters. Even if they have killed four or five people, they have killed people that we\'ve really disliked. They have done us a service. And he\'s such a character. That\'s why I\'ve tried to keep him very Shakespearean. --talking about his character John Abruzzi from Prison Break (2005)      They [the Coen Brothers] have an obsession with pancakes. It\'s a Midwestern thing, I guess. I had never had pancakes. I grew up in Sweden, and I\'m not a big fan of pancakes.      Yeah, prep is very important -- for me, at least. I like to improvise. But if you\'re the only one improvising, then you can f**k it up for other actors in the scene if you\'re the only one coming up with new things. Sometimes it can be good, and the director tells you to do something to stir or awaken the actors whom you\'re playing with, or they do it to you and you have a great reaction. But I think it\'s the directors who especially need to prepare their work. A lot of young directors today work on digital and run the cameras 24/7, and it\'s tedious for an actor to do the same scene over and over again. When a director is prepped, you feel very secure, and you become a better actor. He knows what he wants and he\'s like, ""Okay, let\'s move on to the next scene.""      There are so many people who hate themselves, and I realized early on that you can\'t change your looks. You have to live with what you\'ve got. And you have to give yourself credit every morning by saying ""yes!"" -- and that\'ll help you. But if you dis yourself every morning, it\'s not good for you mentally, and it won\'t help your appearance. It\'s not that I love my looks. But ... it\'s me. And I cherish the blessing that there\'s only one me in this world. I\'m happy about that fact, and it shines through sometimes.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nGabriel Macht ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 31 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(2)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(12)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(15)  Overview (2)Date of Birth22\xa0January1972,\xa0The Bronx, New York City, New York, USA Height6\'\xa0(1.83\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Gabriel Macht is an American actor.

I can\'t argue my way out of a paper bag.      I believe that shows should be shot where they take place.      Honestly, I\'m not a massive fan of courtroom dramas.      Frank Miller is more of a visionary than any director I\'ve ever worked with, and he achieves that vision better than anyone I\'ve ever worked with.      My family is full of musicians, and a couple of times a year we get together and jam at my cousin\'s studio. We improvise and have a great time.      If you go to pilot then you are probably going to go to series. That\'s my feeling about it.      I\'m a T-shirt-and-jeans-with-combat-boots guy. And if I don\'t have to shave, I don\'t.      I\'m a straight shooter, and most of the time my ego doesn\'t interrupt my relationships.      I really feel that New York City is the greatest city in the world.      My father is an actor, and I used to go on set to visit him. I saw the stories he was telling and said: \'That\'s what I want to do.\' I was always in awe whenever I went to the movies or when I watched television.      I think if you\'re artistic in any way, you\'re probably born with it. I guess it\'s a talent that can be learned here and there, but I think the instinct to tell a story or to create something happens maybe in the womb.      I grew up in New York till I was 5, and I remember going to see \'Annie\' and some musicals as a kid, and I remember my parents being somewhat okay with us watching \'Rocky Horror Picture Show,\' which, it boggles my mind that they allowed me to watch it.      For me, I think there\'s a lot more room in cable television to tell broader stories. NBC and the networks, they\'re all very mainstream, and they\'re a little more conservative in how they approach storytelling.

After reading so many negative reviews of this movie, I expected the worst
and almost didn't see it.  But I was in the mood for a movie and it was the
only one showing that I hadn't already seen that was even remotely of
interest to me.  To my surprise I enjoyed the movie and where I think so
many critics went wrong was to view this movie as a comedy, which it really
isn't, except for a few humorous moments as might be expected in any such
action movie.  And Anthony Hopkins actually played his role the way it
should have been played.  It was not a role calling for a wild comic genius
but one calling for a very serious-minded professional who is involved in
trying to train a novice in just a few days for a deadly game involving a
nuke.  Chris Rock also played his role as it should have been played and
restrained himself from his usual antics, as in ""Lethal Weapon 4.""  Not a
great movie but much better than the awful ""The Sum Of All
Fears.""

Chris Rock stars as a CIA agent and a street hustler, twin brothers
separated at birth. When the more successful brother, Kevin (ironically
the
one who got his act together and made a life for himself, yet also the one
who got himself killed) is shot escaping a touchy sting operation in which
he and his team try to buy a stolen nuclear weapon with cyber money that
doesn't exist in real life, the CIA are faced with abandoning a 2 year
project and risking themselves because their new enemies are going to want
to know what happened to their deal or seeking out Kevin's twin brother
Jake, who makes a living whipping the crap out of unsuspecting chess
players
in Central Park and selling scalped tickets to just about any event you
can
imagine.<br><br>At this point in the film, it's clear that the premise is a remarkably
strong one for an action comedy - the irony of having a street hustler
suddenly thrown into a top secret CIA operation. And when you throw in
Chris
Rock as the hustler and Anthony Hopkins as his new mentor, it seems that
you
simply can't go wrong. Unfortunately, the movie seems to lose track of the
fact that it is a comedy, and in more ways that just forgetting to throw
in
some good one-liners.<br><br>Bad Company was made and scheduled to be released before September 11th,
but
was then delayed for obvious reasons (similar to the obvious reasons that
delayed the release of the much more incendiary Collateral Damage, given
its
subject matter). Because the movie was written before the attacks, the
writers can't have been expected to have known what bad taste it was to
center the plot on a stolen nuclear device that was meant to level a major
city on the eat coast. I don't hold that against it because of the 9/11
attacks, but only because it is such a tired premise. When are we going to
see some good action movies that are about something other than one guy
who
has to save a whole city from terrorists with big bombs?<br><br>There are points in the movie where it seems that the writers stopped and
said, `Oh wait, this is supposed to be a comedy,' and threw in a few
completely unamusing jokes here and there, mostly in the form of totally
inappropriate one-liners from Rock that almost invariably fall completely
flat. He and Hopkins do, however, have a bit of chemistry onscreen, but it
is mostly wasted. This is a flashy Bruckheimer production, obviously, but
it
is one of the least interesting action films that Bruckheimer has turned
out
in years. Granted, most of his productions are cheesy crap, but this one
even manages to be boring despite itself.<br><br>I watched Bad Company right after watching Men in Black II, and so was
already prepared for disappointment, but I found myself trying to figure
out
why exactly the movie is called Bad Company. Surely it can't be because
the
CIA is forced to employ someone literally off the street, because he turns
out to be remarkably bright and much more capable than they had
anticipated.
Then at the end of the movie, just as the bad guy is about to get killed,
he
says something about how we Americans think we're so great but we just sit
here while people all over the world suffer and die, and we just watch it
on
our televisions and grab another burger. This is, of course, disturbingly
true, and it is not a small part of the reason that four airplane were
hijacked in late 2001. It's something that Americans love to ignore so
that
we can pretend we're victims. The victims on September 11th were the
people
in the buildings and the people in the planes and al of their families,
the
country itself was not.<br><br>Does `Bad Company,' then, refer to the company that the rest of the world
is
in, being in the company of America? It seems that the message that this
film leaves resonating in your mind at the end is about what a selfish and
greedy country America is, and how capable we are to ignore the suffering
of
the rest of the world as long as we have our fancy cars and our money and
our heart disease instead of starvation. In this case, I guess Bad
Company's
not such a bad movie after all. It certainly gives a pretty potent wake up
call at the end, but one that will probably be largely ignored along with
the rest of the film. Ah well.

In Prague, the CIA secret agent Kevin Pope (Chris Rock) is killed in a
mission with Oakes (Anthony Hopkins). They were trying to recover a nuclear
bomb from the hands of some mercenaries. In order to proceed with the
operation, Jake Hayes (Chris Rock), twin of Kevin, is recruited by CIA to
act as if he were his brother. Jake is a rascal ticker scalper and his dead
brother was an exquisite man. The CIA agents have nine day to make Jake as
refined as he brother was. Although having a plot very predictable and full
of cliches, this movie is a funny action movie, almost a comedy. Therefore,
it objective of entertainment is accomplished. My vote is
seven.

I have to say, this movie caught me off guard. Aside from some incredible
cinematic scenery (Prague is a beautiful city), I didn't expect this to be
much of a movie. And while it may be difficult for some to believe that
Chris Rock is CIA, I found this movie to address something serious and use
Rock's natural humor to both lighten and relieve the audience. There has
to
be something said for how funny Chris Rock is, regardless of the setting.

This film, as far as action films goes, is really not all that bad. I
normally don't like the genre too much for it's continuance of formula, but
this film was a surprise. The choreography was very well done and there were
some good one-liners contributing to some amusement along the way. Anthony
Hopkins and Chris Rock act well in this film, alongside the twisted Russian
mafia boss whom was brilliant, also to be found acting in the superb Guy
Richie film 'Snatch'. The photography of Prague was stunning, great camera
angles and a dramatic mood portrayed well in this beautiful city.<br><br> Regarding the Trevor Rabin track 'BMBBO'... I loved immediately it for its
grace and sombre melancholic mood when I heard it in the film, but was so
mistaken when finally getting hold of the track... what trickery! The
beautiful strings and violin, the elegance and subtlety, gets butchered a
minute in by tacky electronica. what a shame to have this masterpiece
ruined. In the film obviously adaptations were made for particular scenes
and I got the high-octane 'alternative' version, as released on the CD,

After reading so many negative reviews of this movie, I expected the worst
and almost didn't see it.  But I was in the mood for a movie and it was the
only one showing that I hadn't already seen that was even remotely of
interest to me.  To my surprise I enjoyed the movie and where I think so
many critics went wrong was to view this movie as a comedy, which it really
isn't, except for a few humorous moments as might be expected in any such
action movie.  And Anthony Hopkins actually played his role the way it
should have been played.  It was not a role calling for a wild comic genius
but one calling for a very serious-minded professional who is involved in
trying to train a novice in just a few days for a deadly game involving a
nuke.  Chris Rock also played his role as it should have been played and
restrained himself from his usual antics, as in ""Lethal Weapon 4.""  Not a
great movie but much better than the awful ""The Sum Of All
Fears.""

Chris Rock stars as a CIA agent and a street hustler, twin brothers
separated at birth. When the more successful brother, Kevin (ironically
the
one who got his act together and made a life for himself, yet also the one
who got himself killed) is shot escaping a touchy sting operation in which
he and his team try to buy a stolen nuclear weapon with cyber money that
doesn't exist in real life, the CIA are faced with abandoning a 2 year
project and risking themselves because their new enemies are going to want
to know what happened to their deal or seeking out Kevin's twin brother
Jake, who makes a living whipping the crap out of unsuspecting chess
players
in Central Park and selling scalped tickets to just about any event you
can
imagine.<br><br>At this point in the film, it's clear that the premise is a remarkably
strong one for an action comedy - the irony of having a street hustler
suddenly thrown into a top secret CIA operation. And when you throw in
Chris
Rock as the hustler and Anthony Hopkins as his new mentor, it seems that
you
simply can't go wrong. Unfortunately, the movie seems to lose track of the
fact that it is a comedy, and in more ways that just forgetting to throw
in
some good one-liners.<br><br>Bad Company was made and scheduled to be released before September 11th,
but
was then delayed for obvious reasons (similar to the obvious reasons that
delayed the release of the much more incendiary Collateral Damage, given
its
subject matter). Because the movie was written before the attacks, the
writers can't have been expected to have known what bad taste it was to
center the plot on a stolen nuclear device that was meant to level a major
city on the eat coast. I don't hold that against it because of the 9/11
attacks, but only because it is such a tired premise. When are we going to
see some good action movies that are about something other than one guy
who
has to save a whole city from terrorists with big bombs?<br><br>There are points in the movie where it seems that the writers stopped and
said, `Oh wait, this is supposed to be a comedy,' and threw in a few
completely unamusing jokes here and there, mostly in the form of totally
inappropriate one-liners from Rock that almost invariably fall completely
flat. He and Hopkins do, however, have a bit of chemistry onscreen, but it
is mostly wasted. This is a flashy Bruckheimer production, obviously, but
it
is one of the least interesting action films that Bruckheimer has turned
out
in years. Granted, most of his productions are cheesy crap, but this one
even manages to be boring despite itself.<br><br>I watched Bad Company right after watching Men in Black II, and so was
already prepared for disappointment, but I found myself trying to figure
out
why exactly the movie is called Bad Company. Surely it can't be because
the
CIA is forced to employ someone literally off the street, because he turns
out to be remarkably bright and much more capable than they had
anticipated.
Then at the end of the movie, just as the bad guy is about to get killed,
he
says something about how we Americans think we're so great but we just sit
here while people all over the world suffer and die, and we just watch it
on
our televisions and grab another burger. This is, of course, disturbingly
true, and it is not a small part of the reason that four airplane were
hijacked in late 2001. It's something that Americans love to ignore so
that
we can pretend we're victims. The victims on September 11th were the
people
in the buildings and the people in the planes and al of their families,
the
country itself was not.<br><br>Does `Bad Company,' then, refer to the company that the rest of the world
is
in, being in the company of America? It seems that the message that this
film leaves resonating in your mind at the end is about what a selfish and
greedy country America is, and how capable we are to ignore the suffering
of
the rest of the world as long as we have our fancy cars and our money and
our heart disease instead of starvation. In this case, I guess Bad
Company's
not such a bad movie after all. It certainly gives a pretty potent wake up
call at the end, but one that will probably be largely ignored along with
the rest of the film. Ah well.

In Prague, the CIA secret agent Kevin Pope (Chris Rock) is killed in a
mission with Oakes (Anthony Hopkins). They were trying to recover a nuclear
bomb from the hands of some mercenaries. In order to proceed with the
operation, Jake Hayes (Chris Rock), twin of Kevin, is recruited by CIA to
act as if he were his brother. Jake is a rascal ticker scalper and his dead
brother was an exquisite man. The CIA agents have nine day to make Jake as
refined as he brother was. Although having a plot very predictable and full
of cliches, this movie is a funny action movie, almost a comedy. Therefore,
it objective of entertainment is accomplished. My vote is
seven.

This movie was very entertaining but certainly not great. I think Chris
Rock
gave a great performance and Anthony Hopkins is always wonderful. The
action
sequences were very good, especially the camera work in the field car
chase.
I'm glad I didn't see it in the theater, but I'm glad I saw it just the
same.

I have to say, this movie caught me off guard. Aside from some incredible
cinematic scenery (Prague is a beautiful city), I didn't expect this to be
much of a movie. And while it may be difficult for some to believe that
Chris Rock is CIA, I found this movie to address something serious and use
Rock's natural humor to both lighten and relieve the audience. There has
to
be something said for how funny Chris Rock is, regardless of the setting.
This movie is worth watching if you are in the mood for a funny movie with
an action filled plot.

Chris Rock is hilarious in this film. Anthony Hopkins is good too.<br><br>It includes many funny scenes and the action is also good. But the plot it's
nothing special at all and the film is not very bad but not very good
either. If Chris Rock were not in it, it would be bad. I would rate it a
6/10

This film, as far as action films goes, is really not all that bad. I
normally don't like the genre too much for it's continuance of formula, but
this film was a surprise. The choreography was very well done and there were
some good one-liners contributing to some amusement along the way. Anthony
Hopkins and Chris Rock act well in this film, alongside the twisted Russian
mafia boss whom was brilliant, also to be found acting in the superb Guy
Richie film 'Snatch'. The photography of Prague was stunning, great camera
angles and a dramatic mood portrayed well in this beautiful city.<br><br> Regarding the Trevor Rabin track 'BMBBO'... I loved immediately it for its
grace and sombre melancholic mood when I heard it in the film, but was so
mistaken when finally getting hold of the track... what trickery! The
beautiful strings and violin, the elegance and subtlety, gets butchered a
minute in by tacky electronica. what a shame to have this masterpiece
ruined. In the film obviously adaptations were made for particular scenes
and I got the high-octane 'alternative' version, as released on the CD,
which by the way, sounds like something from the 80's, a Jean-Michelle Jare
lasertropic overdose.

...but I'm glad I used a free ticket to see it.<br><br>Anthony Hopkins is clearly slumming.  It's like he polished of his cameo
character from Mission Impossible 2 and set it to work for a whole
film.<br><br>The movie is supposed to be an action comedy but the action scenes are
limited to a few machine gun firefights conducted by people who can't hit
targets 10 feet away, and a single car chase.<br><br>The comedy is limited to hearing Hopkins use the phrase ""get in the car,
b*tch"" and some Chris Rock moments.  It was simply neither action-packed
enough or funny enough for the genre.<br><br>The whole film felt like a first or second draft of the script; like no one
bothered to polish &amp; refine the concept.  It needed better, more original &amp;
well thought out action scenes, and better humor.<br><br>Not bad free, but not even worth a matinee.  I give it a 5 out of
10

I\'ve learned that success comes in a very prickly package. Whether you choose to accept it or not is up to you. It\'s what you choose to do with it, the people you choose to surround yourself with. Always choose people that are better than you. Always choose people that challenge you and are smarter than you. Always be the student. Once you find yourself to be the teacher, you\'ve lost it.      I remember sitting down in Joel Silver\'s office and Joel going, ""Do you want to do this film?"". I remember going, ""I would like to do it, but I would love to talk about the character"", and it was almost like I had said the biggest joke.      The only reason I haven\'t married yet, is because I take it too seriously.      Fame means when your computer modem is broken, the repair guy comes out to your house a little faster.      I have no desire to maintain a lifestyle. I am a horrible celebrity. If I am out in public, I dress like a pig.      The Acadamy Awards shouldn\'t even nominate Meryl Streep anymore. She should just be given an award every year. There should just be the Meryl Streep category.      Everyone told me to pass on Speed (1994) because it was a ""bus movie"".      I\'d rather take risks than make something that\'s cookie cutter.      The first Miss Congeniality (2000) gave me the chance to do broad comedy that had nothing to do with being the romantic interest. The girl-next-door thing went away with that film and I tend to do characters that I want to be more like. In the beginning, though, I was sort of the ""action girl"". And then with While You Were Sleeping (1995), I was the romantic-comedy girl. But when I took time off, I thought, ""There\'s something I\'m missing here."" I literally had to start from scratch.      I don\'t like to talk about personal things. And by keeping it private, you have a better shot at a healthy relationship. I learned at a young age that there are certain things you just don\'t talk about.      I don\'t think there\'s ever what could be called a ""chilled state"" in my head.      My goal now is to remember every place I\'ve been, only do things I love and not say yes when I don\'t mean it.      [on motherhood] If I\'m blessed with that, I hope I am the best version of me that I can possibly be. (People magazine)      Movie sex scenes are never romantic, and you\'re never swept off your feet. It\'s always very technical. I\'m counting the beats: Okay, we\'re supposed to kiss for two beats, then I say my line, then they want another kiss for four beats. I\'m going, One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three and break. It\'s like choreography. Sometimes, you have actors who feel it\'s their job to get as far down into your throat as possible. You\'re like, Excuse me, I like you, but not that much.      Why do you need one? I don\'t understand why there needs to be a love interest to make women go see a film. I think society sort of makes us feel that way - that if you don\'t have a guy, you\'re worthless.      On Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997): That was a mistake but, in retrospect, how are you supposed to know?      (On how it felt and what it said about life that she was nominated for a Razzie and an Oscar for Best Actress within two days in 2010): That life is perfectly balanced.      I used to be an optimist, but now I know that nothing is going to turn out as I expect.      [Contrasting highs in her professional life with lows in her private life] Whoever established the high road, and how high it was going to be, should be fired.      The sexiest man alive? My husband and then, Keanu!! (2006)      [on Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011), her film about 911] The story is about honoring people\'s grief, while giving them permission to have it. And I loved that it showed generations in pain, and how they healed each other by listening and talking.      [on being changed by motherhood] I cry at everything now... I\'ve become more open to surprises and feelings.      [on her largely solo performance in Gravity (2013) simulating being adrift in outer space] I actually never thought about being alone on screen for such a long time until I started doing press, and everyone asked me if that made me nervous, and then I started panicking. I was mostly concerned about the Vomit Comet. I was literally acting off of nothing for up to 10 hours a day, with headphones my only connection to Alfonso [Cuarón, director]. We made a catalog of music clips - whale sounds, Radiohead, weird screeching of metal - and I memorized them. I would say, ""Okay, give me No. 4. That\'s not working. Try No. 2. That\'s better, that\'s getting me to the emotion I need."".      [on Gravity (2013)] It\'s about rebirth. How do you let go in the worst possible situation so you can have some kind of release and peace? Life is not going to stop coming at you. In the end, you just have to say, ""I have no control."" Your time is precious. Are you really going to waste it worrying about this stuff?      [Responding to morning news of her 2nd Oscar-nomination in 2014] I don\'t think it ever stops being an absolute thrill, but I do have an immediate leveler. I still have to get up and make lunch for a little person, and pray - please, dear God - that he eats something I put in his lunchbox today.      What everyone needs is love, unconditionally.      I hate taking selfies. I will not take a selfie that I can\'t erase. I don\'t post or do any of that stuff. People have these worlds they post and it\'s about projecting an image and getting likes. I read a great article about how there\'s a higher rate of depression because people are looking at everyone else\'s Facebook [pages] and seeing this picture-perfect life. We\'re not representing our lives truthfully. Like when you\'re yelling at your child, you\'re not taking a selfie of you being a horrible parent. No, you\'re waiting for the perfect selfie. \'Do I look thinner now?\' \'Do I look great?\' It\'s this false projection of one\'s life. Hollywood has now gone global.

She is of mostly Irish, German, and French-Canadian descent. Ellen worked a number of jobs before she became an actress. At 14, she was a short-order cook at a lunch counter. After graduating from Detroit\'s Cass Technical High School, she went to Texas to model and then to New York as a showgirl on The Jackie Gleason Show (1952). From there, it was to Montreal as a nightclub dancer and then Broadway with her debut in ""Fair Game (1957)"". By 1963, she appeared on the TV series The Doctors (1963), but she gained notice for her role in Goodbye Charlie (1964). Ellen then took time off to study acting with Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio.Her big break came when she was cast as the female lead in The Last Picture Show (1971). For this role, she received nominations for the Golden Globe and Academy Award. Next, she co-starred with Jack Nicholson in The King of Marvin Gardens (1972), giving a chilling performance. Then came The Exorcist (1973). Ellen was again nominated for the Golden Globe and Academy Award. In 1974, she starred in Alice Doesn\'t Live Here Anymore (1974), playing a waitress, which is a job that she well knows. For this performance, she won the Oscar as Best Actress as well as the British award for the same category. For the Golden Globe, she was nominated but lost to Marsha Mason. The same year, Ellen made history by winning a Tony Award for the Broadway play ""Same Time, Next Year"". She won praise and award nominations for the movie version of Same Time, Next Year (1978) and Resurrection (1980). ""Resurrection"" was a another great film in which she played a woman with the power to heal. Even with all these successful movies and all the awards, Ellen found that she could barely get a job in the 80s. A succession of TV movies resulting in two Emmy nominations kept Ellen going as did the series The Ellen Burstyn Show (1986). The TV movies continued through the 90s. Also in the 90s, Ellen was cast in the supporting role in such movies as The Cemetery Club (1993), How to Make an American Quilt (1995), The Baby-Sitters Club (1995) and The Spitfire Grill (1996).

She wrote to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences to protest Liv Ullmann\'s elimination from Oscar contention in 1974 for her performance in Scener ur ett äktenskap (1973) (aka ""Scenes from a Marriage""). AMPAS used a rule under which TV presentations must have appeared in movie theaters in the same year, to prevent Ullmann from being nominated. The result is that Burstyn won the Oscar for her performance in Alice Doesn\'t Live Here Anymore (1974).      Burstyn was not able to attend the 1975 Academy Awards Ceremony, thus couldn\'t accept her Best Actress Oscar for Alice Doesn\'t Live Here Anymore (1974).

""I\'ve wanted an Oscar since I was seven years old. It is the basis of all my secret fantasies."" -- quoted by Robert Osborne in ""Academy Awards 1974 Oscar Annual"".      It\'s unfortunate but our society is such that, for women in Hollywood, you get to a certain age and just fall off a cliff. But in my case, I refuse to die.

The main way you grow is in deepening compassion. Somehow when you go through painful experiences you\'re more sympathetic to other people\'s experiences. After you\'ve been working for awhile and discover how much material you have to call on, you end up saying, \'Oh, thank god I had an unhappy childhood!\' I suppose there are some actors somewhere who have had a happy childhood. I just haven\'t met them yet.

Maybe it\'s here in the U.S. that we find a healing, for in the broader melting pot we get to look at some of these self-destructive attributes that we bring to bear upon our own quarrels and begin to solve them in ways other than just splitting apart.      When I first came to Hollywood, I could not break into movies.      People think we are such great talkers, but there is so much silence in Ireland about certain issues.      I think Irish women are strong as horses, incredibly loyal and for the most part, funny, witty, bright and optimistic in the face of devastating reality.      The image of Ireland is projected as a male image in the acting world, similar to the way that the word of Ireland is male dominated.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nJames Garner ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 137 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(5)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(3)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(104)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(22)\xa0|Salary\xa0(1)  Overview (5)Date of Birth7\xa0April1928,\xa0Norman, Oklahoma, USA Date of Death19\xa0July2014,\xa0Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, USA      \xa0(acute myocardial infarction)    Birth NameJames Scott BumgarnerNicknameSlick    Height6\'\xa02""\xa0(1.88\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Amiable and handsome James Garner had obtained success in both films and television, often playing variations of the charming anti-hero/con-man persona he first developed in Maverick, the offbeat western TV series that shot him to stardom in the late 1950s.James Garner was born James Scott Bumgarner in Norman, Oklahoma, to Mildred Scott (Meek) and Weldon Warren Bumgarner, a carpet layer. He dropped out of high school at 16 to join the Merchant Marines. He worked in a variety of jobs and received 2 Purple Hearts when he was wounded twice during the Korean War. He had his first chance to act when a friend got him a non-speaking role in the Broadway stage play ""The Caine Mutiny Court Martial (1954)"". Part of his work was to read lines to the lead actors and he began to learn the craft of acting. This play led to small television roles, television commercials and eventually a contract with Warner Brothers. Director David Butler saw something in Garner and gave him all the attention he needed when he appeared in The Girl He Left Behind (1956). After co-starring in a handful of films during 1956-57, Warner Brothers gave Garner a co-starring role in the the western series Maverick (1957). Originally planned to alternate between Bart Maverick (Jack Kelly) and Bret Maverick (Garner), the show quickly turned into the Bret Maverick Show. As Maverick, Garner was cool, good-natured, likable and always ready to use his wits to get him in or out of trouble. The series was highly successful, and Garner continued in it into 1960 when he left the series in a dispute over money.In the early 1960s Garner returned to films, often playing the same type of character he had played on ""Maverick"". His successful films included The Thrill of It All (1963), Move Over, Darling (1963), The Great Escape (1963) and The Americanization of Emily (1964). After that, his career wandered and when he appeared in the automobile racing movie Grand Prix (1966), he got the bug to race professionally. Soon, this ambition turned to supporting a racing team, not unlike what Paul Newman would do in later years.Garner found great success in the western comedy Support Your Local Sheriff! (1969). He tried to repeat his success with a sequel, Support Your Local Gunfighter (1971), but it wasn\'t up to the standards of the first one. After 11 years off the small screen, Garner returned to television in a role not unlike that in Support Your Local Sheriff! (1969). The show was Nichols (1971) and he played the sheriff who would try to solve all problems with his wits and without gun play. When the show was canceled, Garner took the news by having Nichols shot dead, never to return in a sequel. In 1974 he got the role for which he will probably be best remembered, as wry private eye Jim Rockford in the classic The Rockford Files (1974). This became his second major television hit, with Noah Beery Jr. and Stuart Margolin, and in 1977 he won an Emmy for his portrayal. However, a combination of injuries and the discovery that Universal Pictures\' ""creative bookkeeping"" would not give him any of the huge profits the show generated soon soured him and the show ended in 1980. In the 1980s Garner appeared in few movies, but the ones he did make were darker than the likable Garner of old. These included Tank (1984) and Murphy\'s Romance (1985). For the latter, he was nominated for both the Academy Award and a Golden Globe. Returning to the western mode, he co-starred with the young Bruce Willis in Sunset (1988), a mythical story of Wyatt Earp, Tom Mix and 1920s Hollywood.In the 1990s Garner received rave reviews for his role in the acclaimed television movie about corporate greed, Barbarians at the Gate (1993). After that he appeared in the theatrical remake of his old television series, Maverick (1994), opposite Mel Gibson. Most of his appearances after that were in numerous TV movies based upon The Rockford Files (1974). His most recent films were My Fellow Americans (1996) and Space Cowboys (2000) .- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Tony Fontana < tony.fontana@spacebbs.com> and pchemoc389@rogers.com          Spouse (1)               Lois Fleishman Clarke          (17 August\xa01956            - 19 July\xa02014)\xa0(his death)\xa0(2 children)          Trade Mark (3)        His voice was heard at the beginning of every episode of The Rockford Files (1974) on the outgoing message for Jim Rockford\'s answering machine.

Early in his career, he appeared as one of the judges in ""The Caine Mutiny Court Martial"" on Broadway. He said his part consisted mostly of listening to the other actors, and he said it was a great lesson, even though he sometimes had to fight to stay awake during the evening performances. He felt listening was just as important as speaking as an actor.

He was quoted as saying during his commencement ceremony speech, ""If there\'s anything positive to come from this event, it is seeing the character, the toughness with the dignity of the Oklahoma people as they suffer the grief and carry on with their lives. It makes every Oklahoman, where ever we are, to be PROUD to be an Oklahoman."".      James Garner adopted his wife\'s 8 year-old-daughter, Kimberly, after he and Lois were married.

When speaking at the Summer Special Olympics in Norman, Oklahoma, he took the opportunity to remind the Oklahoma officials, who invited him to speak, of the circumstances of his original departure. ""It\'s nice to be invited back as a VIP after being run out of town on a rail."" This was a reference to him being ""asked"" to leave for his ""extracurricular activities"".      He was widely known to be a very private man.      The name of his most famous character, James Scott Rockford, from The Rockford Files (1974), shared his own first and middle name.      He began his film career in 1956 (the same year he got married), as a contract player for Warner Brothers, at a rate of $200 per week.      In the four years (1985-89), he was the television and radio commercial spokesman for Mazda cars, he was reportedly paid $1 million per year, plus one Mazda vehicle of his choice per year. He chose three Mazda RX-7\'s and one Mazda truck, all of which he was known to drive frequently.      He was absent from his role on Maverick (1957), when filming for the fourth season began, because of a contract dispute with Warner Brothers. Garner fought with the studio consistently in court, and his tenacity was rewarded at the end of 1960, when the case was decided in his favor, and the court ordered him to be released from his contract because Warner Brothers had violated several of the provisions in the contract.      James Garner passed away on July 19, 2014, at age 86, and within five months of four other television legends, also born in 1928, either aged 85 or 86: Shirley Temple, Ralph Waite, Maya Angelou, and Horace Silver, and just twenty-four days before his close friend Lauren Bacall, born 1924.      Garner survived a series of health problems, from a knee operation, to a bleeding ulcer, to quintuple bypass heart surgery, to a fall, to emergency surgery to unblock an artery and finally to a stroke.      He changed his last name from Bumgarner to Garner when he became a Warner Brothers contract player. He was credited as Jim Bumgarner for his two stage roles. First as a non-speaking Member of the Court (Martial Tribunal), in the Broadway production of ""The Caine Mutiny Court Martial"", and second, a featured speaking role in the national touring company of the same play. In part because he hated speaking in public, he never again took a stage role, and the name Bumgarner ""died"" when his Warner Brothers contract was signed in 1956.      James Garner passed away on July 19, 2014, at age 86, just one month before he would have celebrated his 58th wedding anniversary with his wife, Lois.      When he was starring on The Rockford Files (1974), having to appear in nearly every scene of the series, doing many of his own stunts, including one that injured his back, was wearing him out. A knee injury from his National Guard days worsened in the wake of the continuous jumping and rolling, all of which led to his 1979 hospitalization, with a bleeding ulcer.      Long lives ran in his family.      After his final two roles, DC Showcase Original Shorts Collection (2010) and Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam (2010), both voice only roles, he completely retired from acting at age 82.      Is the youngest of three children of Weldon ""Bill"" and Mildred Meek Bumgarner.      Used to play golf with James Woods and Bill Bixby.      Was Roy Huggins first choice for the lead role on the Western series Cheyenne (1955), but that role eventually went to an another largely unknown actor, Clint Walker, because the casting director could not reach Garner in time (according to Garner\'s autobiography), and Garner wound up playing an Army officer in the pilot instead.      Acting mentor and friends with Tom Selleck, Kaley Cuoco and Amy Davidson.      When Charlton Heston backed out of the lead role in Darby\'s Rangers (1958) before shooting began, Warner Brothers contract player Garner, who had already been cast in the film in a supporting role, was selected to replace Heston in the lead.      His ex-Maverick (1957) co-star, Jack Kelly guest-starred with him in a two-part episode of The Rockford Files (1974), in 1977.      Had twice worked with Harry Morgan: in Support Your Local Sheriff! (1969) and its sort of sequel, Support Your Local Gunfighter (1971).      Before his The Rockford Files (1974) co-star, Stuart Margolin, appeared with him on Rockford, they worked together on Garner\'s short-lived series, Nichols (1971).      Was friends with Roy Huggins, for 45 years, from 1957 until Roy\'s death in 2002, and was friends with Chas. Floyd Johnson for 40 years, from 1974 until his own death in 2014. A professional reunion of sorts was planned on the series being produced by Johnson, NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service (2003), for Jim to come out of retirement in 2008, but it was ultimately decided that Garner\'s health was still a bit unstable, and friend Ralph Waite was cast instead. Coincidentally, Waite ended up passing away in February 2014, five months earlier than Garner.      Had suffered a fall while working on 8 Simple Rules... for Dating My Teenage Daughter (2002). [January 7, 2004].      Was friends with Maverick (1957) co-star and ""brother,"" Jack Kelly, for 35 years, from 1957 until Kelly\'s death in 1992.      At least three actresses named him as their favorite actor: Mariette Hartley, Joan Van Ark and Lauren Bacall, all three worked with him on The Rockford Files (1974).      He dropped out of Norman High School in Norman, Oklahoma, but was able to earn his diploma while in the United States Army.      Until 1988, he was a heavy smoker.      Was closely advised by financial adviser Irving Leonard, who also advised Clint Eastwood in the late 1950s and 1960s.      In July 1983, Garner filed suit against Universal Studios for $16.5 million (USD) in connection with an ongoing dispute from The Rockford Files (1974). The suit charged Universal with ""breach of contract; failure to deal fairly and in good faith; fraud; and deceit"". It was eventually settled out of court in 1989. As part of the agreement Garner could not disclose the amount of the settlement, but frequently told the story about his wife, Lois, having to remind him to wipe the silly grin off his face.      He sued Universal, a second time, for $2.2 million regarding syndication royalties. The suit charged the studio with ""deceiving him and suppressing information about syndication"". He was supposed to receive $25,000 for each episode running in syndication, but Universal charged him ""distribution fees"", which was not in the contract. He also felt that the studio did not release the show to the highest bidder for the episode reruns. [1998].      At Norman High School, he played football, basketball, golf, and competed in track.      Was separated from Lois in 1979, primarily because he was pushing himself too hard and abusing his body while shooting The Rockford Files (1974). Garner was hospitalized in 1979 with an ulcer and other health problems, which eventually caused the cancellation of The Rockford Files, but Lois did not forgive him until they reconciled in 1982.      Relaunched his career as a contract player for United Artists in 1961, after successfully suing Warner Brothers in 1960 to be released from his contract for Maverick (1957).      Was a celebrity spokesperson for the Office of Energy Conservation in the 1970s, through the Advertising Council\'s Public Service Announcement (PSA) television and radio commercials.Lindsay Wagner was the primary guest star on the very first episode of The Rockford Files (1974). Through much of the 1980s, James Garner and Lindsay Wagner were considered the king or queen, respectively, of quality television movies and miniseries of that period.      Even though his Cherokee Productions was the production company, or even part owner, of many of his movies and television series (in the case of The Rockford Files (1974), Cherokee owned 37.5% of the series) between 1965 and 1980, more often than not, he chose not to be listed in the on-screen credits as a producer. So, he was an ""uncredited"" producer of one kind or another on literally dozens of productions between 1965 and 1981, choosing not to be listed on screen for a variety of reasons, sometimes due to potential, or ongoing, or settled lawsuits, including with Warner Bros. and Universal Studios, among others.      Garner refused to shave the hair off his chest or other body parts for any of his shirtless scenes.      Ten days after his passing, numerous news sources reported that the Los Angeles County Coroner listed ""acute myocardial infarction"" (massive heart attack) as the official cause of his death.

While starring on The Rockford Files (1974), he invited many of his longtime friends and new actors to the set.      Shared the same birthday as R.G. Armstrong, who was 11 years Garner\'s senior. Armstrong guest-starred with Garner on an episode of Maverick (1957).      In 2008, he was planning to come out of retirement from on camera roles when he was cast in NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service (2003), but having a stroke soon after being cast, prevented him from doing it. The role was ultimately given to Ralph Waite, who was also born in 1928, but whose health was holding up rather better at that time. In the end, Waite passed away five months before Garner.      His eldest daughter, Kimberly, who was his wife\'s daughter from a previous marriage, was temporarily stricken with polio.      Replaced John Ritter early in the second season of 8 Simple Rules... for Dating My Teenage Daughter (2002), when Ritter pre-maturely passed away in 2003, while in series production.      Met Doris Day in the romance comedy Move Over, Darling (1963). They remained close friends for the rest of Garner\'s life, for more than 50 years.      During the filing of Grand Prix (1966), it was discovered that James Garner was actually too tall for Formula One racing. In order to fit in the cars, the seats had to be removed and Garner sat on the frame with just a towel or a mat protecting his posterior. Additionally, the roll bars needed to be removed and fitted with taller bars, so they would look realistic and not be noticeably shorter than the top of his helmet.      James Garner passed away on July 19, 2014. A month after his passing, his lifelong best friend, Lauren Bacall died the month before what would have been her 90th birthday. Both Garner and Bacall had worked together on an episode of: The Rockford Files (1974), and in two movies: HealtH (1980) and The Fan (1981).      He considered his first director, Charles Laughton, to be his acting mentor.      When he was very young, he lived with his family in the back of his father\'s country store, in the tiny hamlet of Denver, Oklahoma, which consisted of one building, the country store, and a population of only five persons, his parents, his two brothers and himself. Denver, Oklahoma no longer exists, since it was flooded in order to create Lake Thunderbird, an Oklahoma state reservoir.      He was Oklahoma\'s very first draftee for the Korean War.      He called his friend John Hodiak by the nickname ""Hody"".      Had appeared on the front cover of TV Guide 13 times.      He nearly lost his leg, but he had emergency surgery to unblock an artery. [1998].      At age 17, Garner\'s Father moved to Los Angeles without notifying his three sons. Garner went from Oklahoma to Los Angeles to find him. Then Jim enrolled in Hollywood High School was voted the most popular student.      Upon getting married to Lois, they picked out a house together in the upscale neighborhood of Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, where their neighbors included Steve McQueen (next door), O.J. Simpson, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, Mark Harmon and Pam Dawber, and where James and Lois remained for the rest of James\' life of 58 years until his July 2014 death..      His brother Jack Garner was a week older than Julie London. His brother guest-starred with her on an episode of Emergency! (1972).      He appeared in two films which concerned the D-Day landings on June 6, 1944: The Americanization of Emily (1964) and 36 Hours (1964).      Greatly enjoyed his late in life role in sitcom \'8 Simple Rules\', working with such a young and vibrant cast. In his autobiography he paraphrased General \'Douglas MacArthur\'\'s comments on the Korea War describing his casting as ""A great gift to an old campaigner"".      Quit smoking cigarettes in 2005.Personal Quotes (22)      About everything I ever have done, in the way of lawsuits against studios, I\'ve won them all, because I was right every time.      Marriage is like the Army; everyone complains, but you\'d be surprised at the large number of people who reenlist.      [Asked if he would ever do a nude scene] I don\'t do horror films.      [on his conflicts with Warner Brothers, in relation to his contractual obligations to the television series Maverick (1957)] They really stuck it to me. I was young and dumb. I said a couple things about being under contract that they didn\'t like, like that I felt like a ham in a smokehouse. They were waiting to get back at me by laying me off. We went to court and got out of my contract. I didn\'t want somebody in an office guiding my career. If I had a failure, I wanted it to be my failure. If I had a success, I wanted it to be my success.      I\'m a Spencer Tracy-type actor. His idea was to be on time, know your words, hit your marks and tell the truth. Most every actor tries to make it something it isn\'t  looks for the easy way out. I don\'t think acting is that difficult if you can put yourself aside and do what the writer wrote.      I don\'t like to speak in public. It scares the devil out of me.      I got into the business to put a roof over my head. I wasn\'t looking for star status. I just wanted to keep working.      [on his role as Bret Maverick] I\'m playing me. Bret Maverick is lazy: I\'m lazy. And I *like* being lazy.      (on the passing of his good friend Paul Newman) This is such a sad time, I am truly devastated and there are just not enough words to express my sorrow.      (on Steve McQueen) Steve was my neighbor for some time, I called him ""Crazy McQueen"", because, quite frankly, he was crazy. We were friends, but he wanted to play my part in Grand Prix (1966) and because of that we didn\'t talk for four years. He wasn\'t a great actor, but he was a star - McQueen had probably the highest amount of star quality I\'ve ever seen in an actor.      [When he entered Hollywood High School at the time his gym teacher recommended him for his modeling job]: I made 25 bucks an hour! That\'s why I quit school. I was making more money than the teachers. I never finished the ninth grade.      [Who asked Melissa Gilbert warily]: How long does the speech have to be? Well, this will be shorter than others.      Something funny happens as you get older, you don\'t hold back so much.      [When he got serious into becoming an actor after returning from the Korean War]: I had a wife and an 8-year-old daughter who had just gotten out of the hospital with polio, so I took on that responsibility.      My wife and I felt we\'d just watch the sunset. But then, the phone started ringing with all these wonderful offers.      [When he smoked marijuana for most of his adult life]: I started smoking it in my late teens, I drank to get drunk but ultimately didn\'t like the effect. Not so with grass. It had the opposite effect from alcohol: it made me more tolerant and forgiving. I did a little bit of cocaine in the Eighties, courtesy of John Belushi, but fortunately I didn\'t like it. But I smoked marijuana for 50 years and I don\'t know where I\'d be without it. It opened my mind and now it eases my arthritis.

I liked this movie. I really did. Someone very close to me has a mother
very much like this. It's reality folks, not everyone has a sensible
loving mother that grasps the role of ""motherhood"" like a duck to
water. Some people remain stuck in a selfish state where they blame
everyone/thing else for all their unhappiness and the misdirection of
their lives. I'm glad there's a movie that brought that subject to
light. One user said the movie is celebrating an alcoholic, but that's
untrue. You're watching a woman go further and further into a downward
spiral of self-pitying despair and hatred for the events of her life. I
also didn't find Vivi's mother to be evil, but she seemed to have been
desperately trying to claim her role as a respectable wife. When your
husband treats horses better than you, you get a little miffed. He
dismissed her as his partner in life for a child she gave him, so the
woman aimed her frustrations at her child, instead of her husband. At
that time, what could she have really done to the husband? He would've
beaten her most likely. I appreciated the fact that Vivi was flawed.
Just humanly flawed and admitted it. It sucks that people have parents
like this, but Sidda learned to deal with it in her own way. I'm glad
it wasn't a typical reaction, like drugs or promiscuity. She just
accepted her mother for what she is: flawed and screwed up. Motherhood
doesn't make you unselfish and well-versed in letting go of your
troubles. That's something you learn over time, and the movie showed
that. It might take 40-odd years as it did them, or someone could get
it the moment the child is born. What I got from the film is that your
parents had dreams and nightmares before you came into the picture, and
it takes a lot out of them to come to terms with being responsible for
a life that they may or may not be ready for. I also really loved the
part where Sidda begins to question her ability to be a good mother and
wife. I think that resonated well. I certainly would start to wonder.
Parents can screw up their kids easily I tell ya. It's not a
responsibility to enter into lightly. I'm sure there were flaws like
the accents of Louisiana and technical stuff, but altogether, the movie
really reaches many levels.

What a shame!!!  This is the worst excuse for an adaptation of a novel I
have ever seen.  Nothing is explained about Siddalee, Shep, Vivi, the
Ya-Yas, the younger siblings, Buggy, etc.  No one will understand fully the
anguish that the children went through as children or the anguish that Vivi
went through in her own childhood.  Shortcuts were taken left and right in
this film, much to the detriment of the storyline.  For instance, Shep is
not a living saint, Vivi did not simply beat her children because of
dexamyl, Teensy's mother is barely mentioned, Vivi's stay at the boarding
school was left out, and where is Aunt Jezie, grownup Lulu, Little Shep, and
Baylor?  I realize that it was a two hour film, but an adaptation should
never have been attempted if it wasn't going to be done faithfully. 
Everything in this film was explained away too easily.  Sidda needed much
more than a sob story about her mother's loss and use of dexamyl to explain
her behavior.  Too easy, too simple, too cheesy.  No one could possibly come
away with a clear understanding and resolution of the plot.  <br><br>My recommendation:  SKIP IT and read the fabulous books this was supposedly

I really, really wanted to like this film, and before you read the rest of
this I will say I can't explain why I don't like it without spoilers, so
you've been warned.<br><br>This film is being sold as a feel good, female bonding, mother-daughter,
chick flick.  While it's all those things, it's also about a mother, Vivi
(Ellen Burstyn in the present, Ashley Judd in the past) who drank too much
and beat her kids.  Yes, she lost her true love in the war.  Yes, she had
a
nervous breakdown.  And yes, she really, really feels bad about beating

abusive childhood, Vivi doesn't apologize, she pitches a fit and has
another
Bloody Mary.<br><br>Don't get me wrong.  There were some good times in Sidda Lee's childhood,
and her father reminds her that she should remember those instead.
Because
it is the adult child's responsibility to understand and forgive the

parent.  Yes, that strange sound you hear is my blood boiling.<br><br>So with the help of the (mostly) drunk Ya-Ya Sisters, kidnapped Sidda Lee
comes to understand that her mother was heart broken and sometimes the
kids
all got sick at the same time and that's why she drank and beat the crap
out
of them.  So Sidda forgives Vivi, even though Vivi still never apologized.
Then the band plays and everyone is happy.<br><br>Were there times when I laughed?  You bet.  There are some great lines.
But
the movie is slow, jumps around in time far more than necessary, and
handles
serious issues like alcoholism and child abuse far too lightly.  I have no
idea why this film was championed by Bette Midler, Bonnie Bruckheimer,
Callie Khouri and Sandra Bullock.  Surely they could have found a better

starting an entirely new life, in the process gaining distance from her

the mistreatment she suffered as a child. That serves as a call to
action for her mother's lifelong friends (Fionnula Flanagan, Shirley
Knight, and the incomparable Maggie Smith, wheeling an oxygen tank). It
seems likely at this point that Siddalee's mother Vivi (Ellen Burstyn)
will go to her grave without ever speaking to her beloved daughter
again. Drastic action is called for, and these three ladies are no

and set about the task of helping both mother and daughter to remember
that growth comes from acknowledging connections, not severing them.
They are aided in this task by an ornate scrapbook that the four of
them kept of their youthful adventures as the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.<br><br>The members of this sisterhood do not turn a blind eye to each other's
shortcomings. In one of the film's many poignant moments, Siddalee does
a cruel impersonation of her mother. As the audience readies itself for
Vivi's friends to rush to her defense, one of them (Maggie Smith, of

Excellent is an understatement. The movie, which I saw yesterday, was
exactly like the book, which I read a few months ago. The actors captured

It makes you feel sad, then happy, then sad and then happy again. Maggie
Smith was hilarious as Caro and Ellen Burstyn was outstanding as Vivi
Dahlin'. Ashley Judd played the part of young Vivi brilliantly. It's
probably her finest performance yet.

I really hoped to like this movie. Parts were funny, but large sections
of it were just awful. I don't see how the daughter was supposed to
forgive and forget. Her mother was alcoholic and abusive. Just because
prescription drugs pushed her over the edge doesn't really make her a
great person otherwise. The scenes of her craziness, losing it with the
kids and beating them with a belt just made me sick. The fond memories
her daughter has of her seem fun because they were wild and offbeat,

too.<br><br>I just can't buy the 'all is forgiven' ending, it seemed way too easy

be as good of friends to the poor children at any point in their life

along with series of Hollywood contrivances, but it meanders and

                    After a martini-induced rampage, a fantasy-prone young woman is placed under house arrest.
            ","

In San Francisco, Zoe is a shy and outcast in her working place that adores the love songs she listens to the radio. Zoe goes to a bar with her coworkers and she spends the night talking to a colleague that also like mushy songs. She drinks with him and when she goes to her car to take her cellular to call a taxi, a stalker forces her to drive away. A police officer sees the intruder in her car and asks her to stop the car. However, the guy forces Zoe to run over the policeman that is hit and dies. Zoe has a car accident and the aggressor escapes. Neither the police nor her defense lawyer believes on her words and Zoe is arrested for murdering the policeman. She is confined at home with an ankle bracelet under the surveillance of Daly, a lonely man that falls in love with Zoe. She tries to find a way to leave the spot to chase the criminal and prove her innocence.                Written by

They have a son together, Oscar Holly Marmet (b.June 26, 2016).Personal Quotes (4)      I was always brought up to say please and thank you and always tell the truth, and people were saying, ""Oh my God, what\'s going to happen with your character next year [on Prison Break (2005)]?\' and I wasn\'t allowed to say, so I felt really guilty because I was lying to all these people, including my neighbors. You know, the character had its run, and I was really happy to be part of a show that was so successful and that people loved so much, but there was really nothing else for her to do.      You know, I think my attitude would have stopped me a little bit. I always had a stance like, you know, fuck Maxim. You know, I was supposed to be on the cover and my publicist set up the shoot behind my back and I was like, ""There is no fucking way I am wearing my underpants on the cover of a magazine; they can go fuck themselves."" Sexuality in that way and women using it has been around for forever, but it seems now with Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, it seems that now in order to be successful you need to look like you want to have sex with every guy. I don\'t get it.      [about shaving her head for ""Empire records""] I was a child model and my mom would never let me do anything I wanted like cut my hair or get my ears pierced or any of those phases. I was 21 and for the first time I did something I was dying to do. I had always wanted to do something aberrant like that. I loved having it for a while, but by the end everyone saying ""Excuse me, sir"" was kind of annoying. I wasn\'t thinking about it in terms of some sort of feminist stance. I thought that if you were going to do it, the opportunity of doing it on film was also pretty cool.      I gotta tell you, I like to play the cards. I don\'t have any time anymore like I used to. When I was unemployed sometimes I would be at the casino in the middle of the day. One of my favorite moments on the The Mentalist was when we did an episode we shot at a casino in Los Angeles. The [assistant director] came up to me and said, ""Wait till you see the people in there. Total degenerate gamblers. It\'s terrifying."" And I went to sit and play some hands at lunch and I knew like five people [laughs]. It\'s fun. You have to be completely engaged. But it\'s an incredibly chauvinist game.

A young woman,Zoe,is placed under electronic house arrest for a crime she
did not commit.  The eccentric and energetic `Cherish, ' written and
directed by Finn Taylor (`Dream with the Fishes') has the virtues of romance
and thriller with a good dose of odd love.  It is by far superior to any
other in its multi-genre this year.<br><br>Robin Tunney plays Zoe as a cross between Frankie Potente in `Run, Lola,
Run' and an updated Audrey Hepburn in `Breakfast at Tiffany's.' She indeed
runs for her life, in a sequence clearly influenced by `Lola,' and she hangs
out on an apartment terrace wistfully looking at life as Audrey did almost a
half a century ago. <br><br>Tunney is natural and attractive dealing with the loneliness of exile and a
possible romance with the rep for the electronic imprisoning
device.<br><br>Her antagonist is a male version of Clint Eastwood's nemesis in `Play Misty
for Me'-a cunning loner whose affection for music and Zoe is pathological.
This insanity allows for an eclectic soundtrack rich with the songs of the
50's and 60's and an emphasis on the eccentric contemporary Noe Venable,
perfectly suited to the situation.<br><br>And the music is a star-the pop lyrics give meaning and nostalgia in a world
where Zoe is confined by four walls but liberated by her imagination to
become a passably good roller skater and lovable neighborhood oddity.
Association hit ""Cherish"" is the titular song whose demented lyrics reflect
the antagonist's sick obsession with a girl he can never have.<br><br>Confinement has released her imagination. Finally, an intelligent movie this
summer to share the spotlight with Hugh grant's `About a
Boy.'<br><br>

""Cherish"", directed by Finn Taylor, is worth a look because it's much
better than some other more pretentious movies that fared much better,
be it because hype, or wider distribution. The talent gathered here is
young and wonderful and the great sound track, mostly from the 80s
works extremely well.<br><br>We first meet Zoe, an insecure young person, as she comes to work in an
office where she sticks out like a sore thumb. Zoe is an original in
her own way, but she tries too hard to fit in. Her mostly sophisticated
coworkers reject her on the basis of looks. Zoe is heavily into music.
We see her dialing her local radio station to ask the D.J. to play
favorites, which he always has ready. Her 'radio' name is Natasha!<br><br>Something horrible happens to Zoe after a party. A policeman is killed
and all points out to Zoe being the culprit. Thus begins a house arrest
in which Zoe is made to wear an ankle strap that will monitor her
movements. Daly, the police department in charge of this operation,
becomes fascinated by this young woman. Suddenly, this man will be
seeing things differently as he falls for Zoe in a no-win situation.<br><br>The viewer is in for a treat because of the immensely winning
performance of Robin Tunney. She is a fantastic presence as Zoe. We get
a feeling of claustrophobia as we watch her confined to a seedy loft
for a crime she has nothing to do with. Tim Blake Nelson, who we have
seen on plays in the New York stage, makes an incredible contribution
to this story that is set in the Bay area. <br><br>""Cherish"" will win anyone with an open heart.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's the type of flick that you want to
see
again, and real soon, because you have the sense you missed a lot the
first
time around.<br><br>The use of music is huge in this movie. Although completely different, I
am
drawing up memories of High Fidelity. Both movies feature music as its own
entity or major theme in the story, not just as a backdrop to help tell
the
story. As a music lover, I just dig this.<br><br>Robin Tunney was phenomenal as Zoe. I think even if I didn't enjoy the
other
characters and the plot so much, this movie would be worth seeing just for
her performance. She did an excellent job of portraying Zoe's journey. Her
performance never felt pushed or strained; she just WAS Zoe, from the
first
scene to the last. Of course, this is what actors are paid for! I just
felt
she did an extraordinary job of capturing the character.<br><br>I love the way this movie was presented. It didn't abuse, or rely on,
special effects. Rather, they were used at just the right time to help
tell
the story.<br><br>This movie has just enough of everything you want in a movie to make it
suitable for all the types of moods you might be in when you see
it!

A fine exploration of love and obsession and a woman's journey for
identity
wrapped in an implausible plot, 'Cherish' is an admirable
film
full of well-rounded, comedic performances by a mostly unsung cast. Robin
Tunney, who some of you may know from the remake of 'The In-Laws', stars
as
Zoe, a ditzy, confused young woman at the beginning of the film. She
defines
herself by her pitiful relationships with men, which through plot
circumstances I won't reveal, result in her being confined to a seedy
apartment somewhere in San Francisco, awaiting trial for a crime she
didn't
commit. Gradually, she discovers her strength as a woman, both physically
and emotionally, through her relationships with her apartment mates, local
neighbors, and most significantly with Tim Blake Daly, who portrays the
cop
who monitors her confinement. Great musical score that comments on the
movie's themes, some great comic bits by the supporting cast and excellent
direction by Finn Taylor. San Franciscans will snicker at the journey Zoe
takes through the city to return to her apartment when she is allowed a
day
of escape, and some folks may scoff at the rather absurd plot, but I found
this to be a very adorable film and recommend it to any film buffs who
have
grown bored by the usual Hollywood mush.

Fine breakthrough performance by Robin Tunney (""The Craft"") and 80's
soundtrack drives this independent sleeper.  Tunney plays a computer
animator named Zoe who likes to fantasize and listen to 80's pop music.  One
night, Zoe's life changes for the worse after a stranger hops in her car and
makes her run over a police officer by accident and he gets away.  As a
result, she finds herself under house arrest with an electronic bracelet
uncomfortably attached to her ankle and limited to 57 feet of space in a
run-down apartment until her trial.  While dealing with confinement and
solitude she tries to improvise.  A parole officer (Tim Blake Nelson) checks
up on Zoe quite frequently and even tries to help her find the assailant
responsible.  And yes, there's chemistry between the two.  Want more info? 
You'll have to see this movie for yourself. <br><br>What makes ""Cherish"" entertaining is that this movie revolves around Zoe.
Writer/director Finn Taylor wants us to identify with Zoe.  We shouldn't
laugh at her, but with her and to sympathize with her.  She uses music as a
tool, a way to overcome misery.  In fact, just about every character uses
music in their own way.  For those who love music are in for a treat.  The
soundtrack contains songs by Hall &amp; Oates, Soft Cell, Modern English and Tom
Petty to name a few.  <br><br>If you're tired of summer blockbusters and want to see something different
and entertaining, this is the movie to track down for the whole family. 
That is, if it's playing in your area.  My evaluation: *** out of
****.

Robin Tunney plays Zoe, a woman who finds herself trapped in her own home
through the home arrest program after being falsely accused as a
cop-killer.
Tim Blake Nelson plays the home arrest worker who often visits to check
on
the equipment.  The new film by Finn Taylor works like a romantic comedy,
but also contains elements of a thriller.  Cherish could easily have
become
buried in pretense or a messy mixture of genres, but it succeeds though,
primarily by focusing on the complex character created by Tunney.<br><br>Most of the film takes place inside the loft apartment Zoe has been
confined
to.  Gradually, she finds ways to expand her circle of territory, which
mirrors her personal growth.  The irony is that when she was free Zoe
never
connected with anyone, but when under arrest she is able to reach out and
develop friendships.  Tunney does a great job of playing an intelligent,
but
obviously flawed character.  Tim Blake Nelson has a much smaller role, but
he does a lot with it.  When he becomes obsessed with Zoe he shows it in
small ways, staring at a photo, buying her a radio.  It's the kind of
behavior I think we've all experienced when someone captures our
attention.
Other cast members that pop up in small but memorable roles include Jason
Priestley (rather unrecognizable as a smarmy co-worker), Liz Phair, Nora
Dunn and Brad Hunt as a stalker.  But special mention should be made of
Ricardo Gil, an amateur actor (he regularly works as a photographer) who
plays Zoe's neighbor, a gay Jewish short person.  Seems a bit extreme when
writing it, but the nice thing is that Gil plays the part well never
delving
into pathos or caricature.  The soundtrack is fun with several cheesy pop
songs from the 70's and 80's, which often are played for comedic effect
like
when our stalker dances around to Hall and Oates's `Private Eyes'.  What
Taylor is aiming for though, is showing us people who want to use pop
songs
as a means of expression.  It's a great twist to the usual method of just
inserting an appropriate tune.

This is one of my favorite independent films. Yeah, the storyline may
not be original, but Robin Tunney and Tim Blake Nelson do such a good
job that you just love their characters (at least I did) and you want
everything to turn out well for them. When I saw this in the theater
originally, I loved the soundtrack, as it fit the storyline so well.
The 80s songs featured are so cheesy and they fit the stalker theme.
This film is so obviously low budget, but the actors involved made the
story interesting, and I got so wrapped up in the story that I didn't
care about the ""little things."" The DVD is well made, with an

Oh this movie had so much potential and I still recommend it as the
soundtrack rocks and Robbin and Tim are both beautiful and so lovely to
watch, but....this is an example, to me, of a good movie just made too
fast or something, I was bummed because it just has such great
potential, there were just way way way too many inconsistencies and
unbelievable situations... i.e. the whole attic/shoot thing she was
always jumping around in, the lovers never catching on, the new red
cordless at the end of the movie, the wood plank suddenly not on the
door just after she placed it there moments before....and the ending?
(Spoiler Alert) actually just before the ending the fight with Mr.
Psycho...it just didn't seem truthful, but I do like the fact that she
took off and didn't get ""saved"" by her cute man and yet the emailing
alludes to the possibility of them hooking up, even if at first he
seemed creepy....so what I'm saying, rent it, but don't expect
truthfulness to the situation...

I liked this movie!  A lot of problems with new indie films is that they
try
to be too artsy (with rapid cuts or industrial music) or too dark where
you
wind up loathing all of the characters.  This movie was neither.  The
soundtrack was ecclectic and quirky.  You were able to sympathize with all
the characters.<br><br>Nelson and Tunney had great chemistry and were fun to watch together.  The
genres (comedy/drama/thriller) meshed very well together to make a
cohesive,
entertaining piece.<br><br>Good job :-)

A young woman,Zoe,is placed under electronic house arrest for a crime she
did not commit.  The eccentric and energetic `Cherish, ' written and
directed by Finn Taylor (`Dream with the Fishes') has the virtues of romance
and thriller with a good dose of odd love.  It is by far superior to any
other in its multi-genre this year.<br><br>Robin Tunney plays Zoe as a cross between Frankie Potente in `Run, Lola,
Run' and an updated Audrey Hepburn in `Breakfast at Tiffany's.' She indeed
runs for her life, in a sequence clearly influenced by `Lola,' and she hangs
out on an apartment terrace wistfully looking at life as Audrey did almost a
half a century ago. <br><br>Tunney is natural and attractive dealing with the loneliness of exile and a
possible romance with the rep for the electronic imprisoning
device.<br><br>Her antagonist is a male version of Clint Eastwood's nemesis in `Play Misty
for Me'-a cunning loner whose affection for music and Zoe is pathological.
This insanity allows for an eclectic soundtrack rich with the songs of the
50's and 60's and an emphasis on the eccentric contemporary Noe Venable,
perfectly suited to the situation.<br><br>And the music is a star-the pop lyrics give meaning and nostalgia in a world
where Zoe is confined by four walls but liberated by her imagination to
become a passably good roller skater and lovable neighborhood oddity.
Association hit ""Cherish"" is the titular song whose demented lyrics reflect
the antagonist's sick obsession with a girl he can never have.<br><br>Confinement has released her imagination. Finally, an intelligent movie this
summer to share the spotlight with Hugh grant's `About a
Boy.'<br><br>

In San Francisco, Zoe (Robin Tunney) is a shy and outcast in her
working place that adores the love songs she listens to the radio. Zoe
goes to a bar with her coworkers and she spends the night talking to a
colleague that also like mushy songs. She drinks with him and when she
goes to her car to take her cellular to call a taxi, a stalker forces
her to drive away. A police officer sees the intruder in her car and
asks her to stop the car. However, the guy forces Zoe to run over the
policeman that is hit and dies. Zoe has a car accident and the
aggressor escapes.<br><br>Neither the police nor her defense lawyer believes on her words and Zoe
is arrested for murdering the policeman. She is confined at home with
an ankle bracelet under the surveillance of Daly (Tim Blake Nelson), a
lonely man that falls in love with Zoe. She tries to find a way to
leave the spot to chase the criminal and prove her innocence.<br><br>I bought ""Cherish"" on DVD a long time ago, and only today I have
watched it. It was a pleasant surprise, since Robin Tunney and the
music score with wonderful songs from the 60's, 70's and 80's make this
good low- budget film also delightful. The conclusion is satisfactory
but could be better and better. My vote is seven.<br><br>Title (Brazil): ""No Lugar e na Hora Errada"" (""In the Wrong Place and

""Cherish"", directed by Finn Taylor, is worth a look because it's much
better than some other more pretentious movies that fared much better,
be it because hype, or wider distribution. The talent gathered here is
young and wonderful and the great sound track, mostly from the 80s
works extremely well.<br><br>We first meet Zoe, an insecure young person, as she comes to work in an
office where she sticks out like a sore thumb. Zoe is an original in
her own way, but she tries too hard to fit in. Her mostly sophisticated
coworkers reject her on the basis of looks. Zoe is heavily into music.
We see her dialing her local radio station to ask the D.J. to play
favorites, which he always has ready. Her 'radio' name is Natasha!<br><br>Something horrible happens to Zoe after a party. A policeman is killed
and all points out to Zoe being the culprit. Thus begins a house arrest
in which Zoe is made to wear an ankle strap that will monitor her
movements. Daly, the police department in charge of this operation,
becomes fascinated by this young woman. Suddenly, this man will be
seeing things differently as he falls for Zoe in a no-win situation.<br><br>The viewer is in for a treat because of the immensely winning
performance of Robin Tunney. She is a fantastic presence as Zoe. We get
a feeling of claustrophobia as we watch her confined to a seedy loft
for a crime she has nothing to do with. Tim Blake Nelson, who we have
seen on plays in the New York stage, makes an incredible contribution
to this story that is set in the Bay area. <br><br>""Cherish"" will win anyone with an open heart.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's the type of flick that you want to
see
again, and real soon, because you have the sense you missed a lot the
first
time around.<br><br>The use of music is huge in this movie. Although completely different, I
am
drawing up memories of High Fidelity. Both movies feature music as its own
entity or major theme in the story, not just as a backdrop to help tell
the
story. As a music lover, I just dig this.<br><br>Robin Tunney was phenomenal as Zoe. I think even if I didn't enjoy the
other
characters and the plot so much, this movie would be worth seeing just for
her performance. She did an excellent job of portraying Zoe's journey. Her
performance never felt pushed or strained; she just WAS Zoe, from the
first
scene to the last. Of course, this is what actors are paid for! I just
felt
she did an extraordinary job of capturing the character.<br><br>I love the way this movie was presented. It didn't abuse, or rely on,
special effects. Rather, they were used at just the right time to help
tell
the story.<br><br>This movie has just enough of everything you want in a movie to make it
suitable for all the types of moods you might be in when you see
it!

A fine exploration of love and obsession and a woman's journey for
identity
wrapped in an implausible plot, 'Cherish' is an admirable
film
full of well-rounded, comedic performances by a mostly unsung cast. Robin
Tunney, who some of you may know from the remake of 'The In-Laws', stars
as
Zoe, a ditzy, confused young woman at the beginning of the film. She
defines
herself by her pitiful relationships with men, which through plot
circumstances I won't reveal, result in her being confined to a seedy
apartment somewhere in San Francisco, awaiting trial for a crime she
didn't
commit. Gradually, she discovers her strength as a woman, both physically
and emotionally, through her relationships with her apartment mates, local
neighbors, and most significantly with Tim Blake Daly, who portrays the
cop
who monitors her confinement. Great musical score that comments on the
movie's themes, some great comic bits by the supporting cast and excellent
direction by Finn Taylor. San Franciscans will snicker at the journey Zoe
takes through the city to return to her apartment when she is allowed a
day
of escape, and some folks may scoff at the rather absurd plot, but I found
this to be a very adorable film and recommend it to any film buffs who
have
grown bored by the usual Hollywood mush.

Fine breakthrough performance by Robin Tunney (""The Craft"") and 80's
soundtrack drives this independent sleeper.  Tunney plays a computer
animator named Zoe who likes to fantasize and listen to 80's pop music.  One
night, Zoe's life changes for the worse after a stranger hops in her car and
makes her run over a police officer by accident and he gets away.  As a
result, she finds herself under house arrest with an electronic bracelet
uncomfortably attached to her ankle and limited to 57 feet of space in a
run-down apartment until her trial.  While dealing with confinement and
solitude she tries to improvise.  A parole officer (Tim Blake Nelson) checks
up on Zoe quite frequently and even tries to help her find the assailant
responsible.  And yes, there's chemistry between the two.  Want more info? 
You'll have to see this movie for yourself. <br><br>What makes ""Cherish"" entertaining is that this movie revolves around Zoe.
Writer/director Finn Taylor wants us to identify with Zoe.  We shouldn't
laugh at her, but with her and to sympathize with her.  She uses music as a
tool, a way to overcome misery.  In fact, just about every character uses
music in their own way.  For those who love music are in for a treat.  The
soundtrack contains songs by Hall &amp; Oates, Soft Cell, Modern English and Tom
Petty to name a few.  <br><br>If you're tired of summer blockbusters and want to see something different
and entertaining, this is the movie to track down for the whole family. 
That is, if it's playing in your area.  My evaluation: *** out of
****.

Robin Tunney plays Zoe, a woman who finds herself trapped in her own home
through the home arrest program after being falsely accused as a
cop-killer.
Tim Blake Nelson plays the home arrest worker who often visits to check
on
the equipment.  The new film by Finn Taylor works like a romantic comedy,
but also contains elements of a thriller.  Cherish could easily have
become
buried in pretense or a messy mixture of genres, but it succeeds though,
primarily by focusing on the complex character created by Tunney.<br><br>Most of the film takes place inside the loft apartment Zoe has been
confined
to.  Gradually, she finds ways to expand her circle of territory, which
mirrors her personal growth.  The irony is that when she was free Zoe
never
connected with anyone, but when under arrest she is able to reach out and
develop friendships.  Tunney does a great job of playing an intelligent,
but
obviously flawed character.  Tim Blake Nelson has a much smaller role, but
he does a lot with it.  When he becomes obsessed with Zoe he shows it in
small ways, staring at a photo, buying her a radio.  It's the kind of
behavior I think we've all experienced when someone captures our
attention.
Other cast members that pop up in small but memorable roles include Jason
Priestley (rather unrecognizable as a smarmy co-worker), Liz Phair, Nora
Dunn and Brad Hunt as a stalker.  But special mention should be made of
Ricardo Gil, an amateur actor (he regularly works as a photographer) who
plays Zoe's neighbor, a gay Jewish short person.  Seems a bit extreme when
writing it, but the nice thing is that Gil plays the part well never
delving
into pathos or caricature.  The soundtrack is fun with several cheesy pop
songs from the 70's and 80's, which often are played for comedic effect
like
when our stalker dances around to Hall and Oates's `Private Eyes'.  What
Taylor is aiming for though, is showing us people who want to use pop
songs
as a means of expression.  It's a great twist to the usual method of just
inserting an appropriate tune.

This is one of my favorite independent films. Yeah, the storyline may
not be original, but Robin Tunney and Tim Blake Nelson do such a good
job that you just love their characters (at least I did) and you want
everything to turn out well for them. When I saw this in the theater
originally, I loved the soundtrack, as it fit the storyline so well.
The 80s songs featured are so cheesy and they fit the stalker theme.
This film is so obviously low budget, but the actors involved made the
story interesting, and I got so wrapped up in the story that I didn't
care about the ""little things."" The DVD is well made, with an
entertaining commentary track and an interesting ""making of""
featurette. What more could a film geek want?

I saw this movie last night and went to bed without words. After having a
chance to sleep on it, it is now starting to sink in how truly amazing
this
movie was. You will be first blown away by the fact that this movie even
exists. It is truly unprecedented in every sense of the word. I don't
remember seeing anything like it, since maybe ""Nanook of the North"", which
would be a stretch.  Unlike ""Nanook"", this movie is shot from the Inuit
perspective, the characters are not looked upon as anthropological
specimens. They are people living in a fragile existence, where any wrong
move could mean sure death.<br><br>The actors are astonishing, and it must have been so terribly cold up
there,
that you know this was a labor of love for the production team. The
scenery
is astonishing. Almost everyone who participated in this production was
full-blooded Inuit. It is a beautiful story based on an Inuit legend that
exists on many different levels and subplots, etc. All told on the frozen
tundra without ANY indication given about the timeframe, or even century,
in
which it was set.<br><br>I am just astonished at the painstaking attention to historical detail. I
have read many books on Inuit culture, and most everything I have read was
visualized in this movie, the social structure, the power of the
patriarch,
the constant looming of starvation, the role of the hunter/husband, the
insubordination of women (pre-arranged marriages), the obsession with
taboo
and curses, the fine art of building igloos and staying warm in -60 temps,
and yet, through all the hardships, there was so much happiness. They even
showed how the dogs were handled and treated, even down to the way they
would slicken their sledge rails by spitting small amounts of water on
them
until a layer of slick frozen ice formed, which makes the sledges slide
easier over the pack ice. The one thing that I thought of today was how
the
movie was TOTALLY absent of the white, European influence. Their knives
were
made from caribou horns; they had no metal knives or metal cookware, which
indicates that the movie was purposely based on a time before the Inuit's
first contact with white men.<br><br>It has a slow start, it's only fault. You will be a bit confused at first,
trying to understand the characters and what exactly is happening, but
then
it starts to really suck you in, you begin to love the protagonists, who
are
physically beautiful people, and then you will grow to hate the
antagonists,
who are mean and undesirable. Afterwards, you will realize that almost all
of these people, cast and crew, were full-blooded Inuit. You will then
want
to immediately see it again and demand a documentary on the making of this
film. You will want to know who these people are, what they do in their
normal lives, because most of these actors are making their big screen
debut. The end of the movie gives you a quick behind-the-scenes peek, but
it
serves as only a small appetizer to a bigger feast. Most importantly, your
respect for their pride and perseverance of their culture will increase
ten-fold

Perhaps the word that best describes this film is 'remarkable'.  It is
remarkable that it was
made at all, by an Inuit film company, remarkable that it was shot on
location in the High
Arctic in conditions of winter and summer, remarkable for its absolute
authenticity, for its
faithfulness both to its subject and to the Inuit culture, which
transcends
remarkable.<br><br>I have been to the High Artic more than once.  I have sat in the great
silence of the north on
the late summer tundra when it turns purple and the winds begin to blow
across the
ground and make the cotton grass sing.  I have heard the snow squeak at
thirty-five below
zero, as it did in this film; filming in such conditions must have been a
nightmare.  Metal
does strange things at those temperatures; cameras freeze and film
becomes
brittle and
breaks into pieces.  Actors get cold and those just standing around get
colder.  There are
no local power sources.  And everything must be flown in by transport
plane,
including
everything needed for the film crew to live and eat.  There are no hotels
and no restaurants,
no pub of an evening and the daylight hours for filiming in February or
March are very
short.  And in the summer, there are the flies.<br><br>The use of Inuktitut, which is still a living language, preserves that
essential atmosphere of
complete authenticity; the building of igloos, the darkness inside the
communal dwelling
with only seal oil lamps, the use of bone and driftwood and dried seaweed
for tools and
fuel are absolutely authentic.  And yet not once did I have the
impression
of watching a
documentary.  These were real people, living real lives, using real
tools,
wearing real
clothing, relying on the hunt, on luck and on each other for
survival.<br><br>The story is set a thousand years ago. It is a legend, but one easily
sees
that it was a real
story, passed down through time in the oral tradition. As it plays itself
out - in the slow
pace of Inuit time, not the frantic, high-pressure pace of our everyday
existence - the rules
of survival become clear, family alliances, taboos, social practices.
Where
survival in a
lethal environment is moment to moment, social rules broken have
immediate
consequences not only for individuals but for the whole community, which
usually
consisted of no more than a dozen or so related individuals.  Jealousy,
murder, theft could
not be tolerated.  The story must not, therefore, be judged by our
standards.  The only way
to see this film is with complete openness; not only must you let the
characters tell you the
events of their drama, you must let them show you why those events were
so
destructive
and why their way of dealing with it was right for them.<br><br>This is about survival in a way that someone living in a city with a
supermarket down the
street, medical care and central heating can probably never fully grasp.
It
is not for the
small-minded, not for anyone who cannot see past his own prejudices or
narrow moral
concepts and it is not for the squeamish.  Survival is messy; it involves
animal guts and
blood and pain, it involves you in your own continued existence in a way
that we can no
longer experience in all our plenty and our ease.  This film is also
about
fierce love,
blinding jealousy, hatred, courage and abiding patience - all things we
share in our
common humanity.  But the filmmakers did not present the characters as
'noble savages'.
Life was about food, about having it or not having it, about hunting it,
gathering it,
bringing it home, preparing it, preserving it, eating it and then doing
it
all over again.  All
the time.  The Inuit are in no way 'primitive' people, whatever that
truly
means; this is how
they survived.  We couldn't do it - and perhaps that makes us the
primitives.<br><br>I was fascinated.  It takes a short while to become used to the
unfamiliar,
the setting, the
names, the culture shock.  After that, it is compelling, and very, very
real.  The events
unfold tragically and inevitably in a distressingly familiar, a
frighteningly human way.  And
you care deeply about the characters, about what happens to them, about
whether they win
out - because it is made very clear that they have every chance of not
surviving for any
number of reasons.<br><br>And it is gorgeous.  The Artic is immensely photogenic but the
cinematography was up to
the challenge.  The sounds are a whole new experience for those who have
never been
there - the wind, the squeak and crunch of the snow, the dogs, the
singing,
the drumming,
the rattling of bones, the sounds of the ice.<br><br>This film is an experience; if the Arctic has ever intrigued you, this
must
not be missed.<br><br>

It tells a legend from the two thousand years ago, about Atanarjuat,
who incurs the jealous enmity of Oki when he marries Atuat Oki kills
Atanarjuat's brother, but Atanarjuat escapes in a stunning sequence,
running naked across the ice floes, outstripping his pursuers until,
his feet torn and bloody, he is taken in by a friendly sorcerer <br><br>The motion picture concedes nothing in the way of authenticity, with
sequences that show in realistic detail the training of sled-dogs,
cutting up animal carcasses or making an igloo But the convincing
ethnographic elements only serve to intensify the compelling story and
characters, which take on a truly epic dimension <br><br>If the purpose of a national cinema is to represent the culture of the
peoples it belongs to, then ""Atanarjuat"" achieves this victoriously,

It is extremely difficult to transfer stories from foreign cultures and oral

with subtle assumptions on how stories hold together and characters should
act; and these assumptions mostly belong to ""Western""-modern culture. I
think this films great achievement is to avoid much of it. One example: It's

is really exciting and touching. It's pace is slow (and I like slow-paced
movies). It's solutions for particular scenes are striking - the appearance
of the bad spirit in the end is eerie, and the effect is just done by the
camera position. On the other hand, there is a sort a documentary immediacy

""Atanarjuat"" was shot not on film but on digital video ... and don't
believe anyone who offers the justification, feeble even if true, that
it's just too hard to shoot on film in sub-zero temperatures. It was
done in the 1920s and it's still done today. Is it perhaps too hard to
shoot 35mm inside igloos at night? Not inherently so; after all,
Stanley Kubrick shot ""Barry Lyndon"" by candlelight back in the
mid-1970s. There's no excuse for shooting as badly as this when it can
be done properly  and, for that matter, no excuse for shooting AT ALL
if it can only be done this badly. The ice vistas cry out for the
sensuous subtlety and razor-sharp precision of film. It's an insult to
the material to settle for less. Imagine how badly ""Lawrence of Arabia""
would have been spoiled if David Lean had said: ""Ack, the sand, ack,
the heat  I think I'll shoot on video.""<br><br>Make no mistake, the digital video ruins the film all by itself. It's
ugly to look at (we can tell, by a process of mental reconstruction,
THAT the ice fields are beautiful, but we cannot actually see the
beauty). Outlines are fuzzy; it's hard not to squint at them. Necessary
details are lost. The pervasive lens flares nearly drove me nuts. In
places there's a weird blotchy purplish discolouration that I'm at a
loss to explain. The lighting continuity errors (and there are many)
are somehow made more obvious. And  although the digital technology is
only indirectly to blame for this  the amateurish, Dogme-style framing
is infuriating. Some say the digital video is the only flaw, which,
apart from being false, is like saying: ""It's a good film, apart from
the fact that all 243,360 frames are terrible.""<br><br>At first I thought that the story would be as tedious and
incomprehensible as the first hour  or perhaps it only feels like an
hour  promises, but luckily, the outlines of a true epic begin to
appear and make it possible for a conscientious audience member to make
it through to the end. (It's good that the film is so long  or at
least, it would be good, if it were at all well made. Perhaps it's good
anyway, as it gives us time to get used to the film's many failings and
begin to ignore them.) We start to care about the central character.
This is by no means the utter disaster the opening hour (half hour,
whatever) would suggest. But not being an utter disaster is hardly much
of an achievement. The acting is at best just barely convincing, at
worst painfully unconvincing, the music is uninspiring, the editing
has, so far as I can tell, not been thought out at all and the entire
supernatural basis of the story has been muffed completely. It would
have been franker to leave out the sorcery altogether, rather than to
have the cinematographic equivalent of a half-mumbled, ""Oh, hang on a
minute, I forgot: the tribal elder was possessed by the Lord of the
Walruses, and ... uh ... some magic stuff happened.""<br><br>These are not nit-picks; they are deep flaws that completely undermine
the story's sweep. Nor are they aspects of the film that anyone (except
children, perhaps) could honestly claim not to have noticed. We cannot

offered in good faith.

For the longest time, I sort of avoided Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner, as
I knew the movie was a long one, and about Inuit legend, something that
really didn't appeal to me. But when the title became available, I
decided to, as they say, throw caution into the wind, and watch this.
After finishing it, I'm really glad I had the experience, as it's a
pretty amazing movie, both in it's story and the sheer fact that it got
made. The story is about one man, Atanarjuat, and his daily life in the
cold harsh arctic. He seems to get along well with the other Inuit, but
soon, a power struggle erupts, and soon he has to rely on the powers
within himself and others to overcome great odds thrown in his way.
Again, the sheer fact that this was made, and the fact that they found
actors in the caliber of performance that Natar Ungalaaq Pulls off is
nothing short of remarkable. I don't know the full story of how this
was made, but I am sure these are first time actors here, and they just
ace it. Probably because the story hits so close to home. The lead
actor, Natar Ungalaaq is to be especially commended for taking so many
acting risks as he did (running naked on ice floes??) The only problem
I have with this, and this seems to be a common complaint with people
who watched this, is that it's quite hard for the first hour or so, to
figure out who's who. But other than that, yeah, try to see this one if
you can, you'll be glad you did.

I saw this movie last night and went to bed without words. After having a
chance to sleep on it, it is now starting to sink in how truly amazing
this
movie was. You will be first blown away by the fact that this movie even
exists. It is truly unprecedented in every sense of the word. I don't
remember seeing anything like it, since maybe ""Nanook of the North"", which
would be a stretch.  Unlike ""Nanook"", this movie is shot from the Inuit
perspective, the characters are not looked upon as anthropological
specimens. They are people living in a fragile existence, where any wrong
move could mean sure death.<br><br>The actors are astonishing, and it must have been so terribly cold up
there,
that you know this was a labor of love for the production team. The
scenery
is astonishing. Almost everyone who participated in this production was
full-blooded Inuit. It is a beautiful story based on an Inuit legend that
exists on many different levels and subplots, etc. All told on the frozen
tundra without ANY indication given about the timeframe, or even century,
in
which it was set.<br><br>I am just astonished at the painstaking attention to historical detail. I
have read many books on Inuit culture, and most everything I have read was
visualized in this movie, the social structure, the power of the
patriarch,
the constant looming of starvation, the role of the hunter/husband, the
insubordination of women (pre-arranged marriages), the obsession with
taboo
and curses, the fine art of building igloos and staying warm in -60 temps,
and yet, through all the hardships, there was so much happiness. They even
showed how the dogs were handled and treated, even down to the way they
would slicken their sledge rails by spitting small amounts of water on
them
until a layer of slick frozen ice formed, which makes the sledges slide
easier over the pack ice. The one thing that I thought of today was how
the
movie was TOTALLY absent of the white, European influence. Their knives
were
made from caribou horns; they had no metal knives or metal cookware, which
indicates that the movie was purposely based on a time before the Inuit's
first contact with white men.<br><br>It has a slow start, it's only fault. You will be a bit confused at first,
trying to understand the characters and what exactly is happening, but
then
it starts to really suck you in, you begin to love the protagonists, who
are
physically beautiful people, and then you will grow to hate the
antagonists,
who are mean and undesirable. Afterwards, you will realize that almost all
of these people, cast and crew, were full-blooded Inuit. You will then
want
to immediately see it again and demand a documentary on the making of this
film. You will want to know who these people are, what they do in their
normal lives, because most of these actors are making their big screen
debut. The end of the movie gives you a quick behind-the-scenes peek, but
it
serves as only a small appetizer to a bigger feast. Most importantly, your
respect for their pride and perseverance of their culture will increase
ten-fold

Perhaps the word that best describes this film is 'remarkable'.  It is
remarkable that it was
made at all, by an Inuit film company, remarkable that it was shot on
location in the High
Arctic in conditions of winter and summer, remarkable for its absolute
authenticity, for its
faithfulness both to its subject and to the Inuit culture, which
transcends
remarkable.<br><br>I have been to the High Artic more than once.  I have sat in the great
silence of the north on
the late summer tundra when it turns purple and the winds begin to blow
across the
ground and make the cotton grass sing.  I have heard the snow squeak at
thirty-five below
zero, as it did in this film; filming in such conditions must have been a
nightmare.  Metal
does strange things at those temperatures; cameras freeze and film
becomes
brittle and
breaks into pieces.  Actors get cold and those just standing around get
colder.  There are
no local power sources.  And everything must be flown in by transport
plane,
including
everything needed for the film crew to live and eat.  There are no hotels
and no restaurants,
no pub of an evening and the daylight hours for filiming in February or
March are very
short.  And in the summer, there are the flies.<br><br>The use of Inuktitut, which is still a living language, preserves that
essential atmosphere of
complete authenticity; the building of igloos, the darkness inside the
communal dwelling
with only seal oil lamps, the use of bone and driftwood and dried seaweed
for tools and
fuel are absolutely authentic.  And yet not once did I have the
impression
of watching a
documentary.  These were real people, living real lives, using real
tools,
wearing real
clothing, relying on the hunt, on luck and on each other for
survival.<br><br>The story is set a thousand years ago. It is a legend, but one easily
sees
that it was a real
story, passed down through time in the oral tradition. As it plays itself
out - in the slow
pace of Inuit time, not the frantic, high-pressure pace of our everyday
existence - the rules
of survival become clear, family alliances, taboos, social practices.
Where
survival in a
lethal environment is moment to moment, social rules broken have
immediate
consequences not only for individuals but for the whole community, which
usually
consisted of no more than a dozen or so related individuals.  Jealousy,
murder, theft could
not be tolerated.  The story must not, therefore, be judged by our
standards.  The only way
to see this film is with complete openness; not only must you let the
characters tell you the
events of their drama, you must let them show you why those events were
so
destructive
and why their way of dealing with it was right for them.<br><br>This is about survival in a way that someone living in a city with a
supermarket down the
street, medical care and central heating can probably never fully grasp.
It
is not for the
small-minded, not for anyone who cannot see past his own prejudices or
narrow moral
concepts and it is not for the squeamish.  Survival is messy; it involves
animal guts and
blood and pain, it involves you in your own continued existence in a way
that we can no
longer experience in all our plenty and our ease.  This film is also
about
fierce love,
blinding jealousy, hatred, courage and abiding patience - all things we
share in our
common humanity.  But the filmmakers did not present the characters as
'noble savages'.
Life was about food, about having it or not having it, about hunting it,
gathering it,
bringing it home, preparing it, preserving it, eating it and then doing
it
all over again.  All
the time.  The Inuit are in no way 'primitive' people, whatever that
truly
means; this is how
they survived.  We couldn't do it - and perhaps that makes us the
primitives.<br><br>I was fascinated.  It takes a short while to become used to the
unfamiliar,
the setting, the
names, the culture shock.  After that, it is compelling, and very, very
real.  The events
unfold tragically and inevitably in a distressingly familiar, a
frighteningly human way.  And
you care deeply about the characters, about what happens to them, about
whether they win
out - because it is made very clear that they have every chance of not
surviving for any
number of reasons.<br><br>And it is gorgeous.  The Artic is immensely photogenic but the
cinematography was up to
the challenge.  The sounds are a whole new experience for those who have
never been
there - the wind, the squeak and crunch of the snow, the dogs, the
singing,
the drumming,
the rattling of bones, the sounds of the ice.<br><br>This film is an experience; if the Arctic has ever intrigued you, this
must
not be missed.<br><br>

It tells a legend from the two thousand years ago, about Atanarjuat,
who incurs the jealous enmity of Oki when he marries Atuat Oki kills
Atanarjuat's brother, but Atanarjuat escapes in a stunning sequence,
running naked across the ice floes, outstripping his pursuers until,
his feet torn and bloody, he is taken in by a friendly sorcerer <br><br>The motion picture concedes nothing in the way of authenticity, with
sequences that show in realistic detail the training of sled-dogs,
cutting up animal carcasses or making an igloo But the convincing
ethnographic elements only serve to intensify the compelling story and
characters, which take on a truly epic dimension <br><br>If the purpose of a national cinema is to represent the culture of the
peoples it belongs to, then ""Atanarjuat"" achieves this victoriously,
both the content of the film and the manner of its telling being wholly
specific to Canada, yet in the process achieving a universal appeal

made. The story is about one man, Atanarjuat, and his daily life in the
cold harsh arctic. He seems to get along well with the other Inuit, but
soon, a power struggle erupts, and soon he has to rely on the powers
within himself and others to overcome great odds thrown in his way.
Again, the sheer fact that this was made, and the fact that they found
actors in the caliber of performance that Natar Ungalaaq Pulls off is
nothing short of remarkable. I don't know the full story of how this
was made, but I am sure these are first time actors here, and they just
ace it. Probably because the story hits so close to home. The lead
actor, Natar Ungalaaq is to be especially commended for taking so many
acting risks as he did (running naked on ice floes??) The only problem
I have with this, and this seems to be a common complaint with people
who watched this, is that it's quite hard for the first hour or so, to
figure out who's who. But other than that, yeah, try to see this one if
you can, you'll be glad you did.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt258463/?,The Bourne Identity (2002) ,7.9,"
                    A man is picked up by a fishing boat, bullet-riddled and suffering from amnesia, before racing to elude assassins and regain his memory.
            ","

Based very loosely on Robert Ludlum's novel, the Bourne Identity is the story of a man whose wounded body is discovered by fishermen who nurse him back to health. He can remember nothing and begins to try to rebuild his memory based on clues such as a Swiss bank account, the number of which is implanted in his hip. He soon realizes that he is being hunted and takes off with Marie on a search to find out who he is - and why he is being hunted.                Written by

Matt has an older brother named Kyle who is now a sculptor. His father is of English and Scottish descent, and his mother is of Finnish and Swedish ancestry. The family lived in Newton until his parents divorced in 1973, when Damon and his brother moved with his mother to Cambridge. He grew up in a stable community, and was raised near actor Ben Affleck.Damon attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and he performed in a number of theater productions during his time there. He attended Harvard University as an English major. While in Harvard, he kept on skipping classes to pursue acting projects, which included the TNT original film, Rising Sun (1993), and prep-school drama, School Ties (1992). It was until his film, Geronimo: An American Legend (1993), was expected to be a big success that he decided to drop out of university completely. Arriving in Hollywood, Matt managed to get his first break with a part in the romantic comedy, Mystic Pizza (1988). However, the film did not do too well and his film career failed to take off. Not letting failure discourage him from acting, he went for another audition, and managed to get a starring role in School Ties (1992). Up next for Matt was a role as a soldier who had problems with drug-addiction in the movie, Courage Under Fire (1996). Matt had, in fact, lost forty pounds for his role which resulted in health problems. The following year, he garnered accolades for Good Will Hunting (1997), a screenplay he had originally written for an English class at Harvard University. Good Will Hunting (1997) was nominated for 9 Academy Awards, one of which, Matt won for Best Original Screenplay along with Ben Affleck. In the year 1998, Matt played the title role in Steven Spielberg\'s film, Saving Private Ryan (1998), which was one of the most acclaimed films in that year. Matt had the opportunity of working with Tom Hanks and Vin Diesel while filming that movie. That same year, he starred as an earnest law student and reformed poker player in Rounders (1998), starring opposite Edward Norton and John Malkovich. The next year, Matt rejoined his childhood friend, Ben Affleck and fellow comedian, Chris Rock, in the comedy Dogma (1999).Towards the end of 1999, Matt played ""Tom Ripley"", a working-class young man who tastes the good life and will do anything to live it. Both Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow also starred in the movie. The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) earned mixed reviews from critics, but even so, Matt earned praise for his performance. Matt lent his voice to the animated movie, Titan A.E. (2000) in the year 2000, which also earned mixed reviews from the public. He also starred in two other movies, All the Pretty Horses (2000) and the golf comedy-drama, The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000), starring alongside Will Smith. In the year 2003, he signed on to star in The Informant! (2009) by Steven Soderbergh and the Farrelly Brothers\' Stuck on You (2003). He also starred in Gerry (2002), a film he co-wrote with his friends, Gus Van Sant and Casey Affleck. One of Matt\'s most recognizable work to date is his role in the ""Bourne"" movie franchise. He plays an amnesiac assassin, ""Jason Bourne"", in The Bourne Identity (2002), The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). Another praised role is that as ""Linus Caldwell"" in the ""Ocean\'s"" movie franchise. He had the opportunity to star opposite George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Don Cheadle in Ocean\'s Eleven (2001). The successful crime comedy-drama eventually had two other sequels, Ocean\'s Twelve (2004) and Ocean\'s Thirteen (2007). Among other highly acclaimed movies that Matt managed to be a part of was in Terry Gilliam\'s The Brothers Grimm (2005), George Clooney\'s Syriana (2005), Martin Scorsese\'s The Departed (2006) and Robert De Niro\'s The Good Shepherd (2006).In his personal life, Matt is now happily married to Argentine-born Luciana Barroso, whom he met in Miami, where she was working as a bartender. They married in a private civil ceremony on December 9, 2005, at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. The couple have four daughters Alexia, Luciana\'s daughter from a previous relationship, as well as Isabella, Gia and Stella. Matt is a big fan of the Boston Red Sox and he tries to attend their games whenever possible. He has also formed great friendships with his Ocean\'s co-stars, George Clooney and Brad Pitt, whom he works on charity projects with. He and actor Ben Affleck, together with Ben\'s wife, Jennifer Garner, are also good family friends and can be often seen going out together with Matt\'s wife.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Anonymous, Dennis Lewis, and Charles Caro          Spouse (1) Luciana Barroso (9 December\xa02005            - present)\xa0(3 children)          Trade Mark (3)        Often works with actors Ben Affleck and George Clooney        Frequently works with director Paul Greengrass        Frequently plays highly intelligent characters, i.e. Will Hunting in \'Good Will Hunting (1997)\', Tom Ripley in \'The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)\', Jason Bourne in The Bourne Series, etc.Trivia (78)      1998: Played in $10,000 buy-in Texas Hold \'Em tournament at the World Series of Poker (www.wsop.com) in Las Vegas.

They try to protect their position like clinging to a beachhead. These actors end up making really safe choices. I never wanted to go that route. If I go down, I\'m going down swinging. I know that\'s the way Heath Ledger feels and Ben Affleck feels the same way, too. We want to take the big swings.      If your movies don\'t perform, they just stop calling you.      I found myself getting more publicly shy when the gala events and big crowds started. Some people embrace it. To me, it\'s not worth enough to risk my private life being public.      I\'m not being a monk. I live my life in New York. I have a girlfriend [Luciana Barroso]. But it\'s not cost-effective for paparazzi to follow us. They can get one picture of us walking down the street.      Now I feel I have an unspoken deal with the paparazzi: ""I won\'t do anything publicly interesting if you agree not to follow me.""      I\'d love to be a dad. I hope I\'d be great at it. That\'s every man\'s fear, yet his most important job.      [on The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)] We\'re all signed on in principle, in the sense that we\'ve all agreed that we want to do it, but we\'re not going to do it unless we have a great script. It\'s ours to lose at the minute and, if we do make a third one, we want to make it as good as the first two. And if we can\'t do that, then we\'re going to have to let it drop.      [on The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)] If you have any ideas for a script, please, call Universal! We\'ve gone so far from the book. [Robert Ludlum] wrote it as a trilogy and we\'ve really kind of ignored that plot because it\'s very Cold War. And so, in the updating process, we kind of threw out most of what he had so we\'re kind of on our own to find a third one. ""Bourne Ultimatum"" is the third one and I feel like I\'ve given ultimatums in both the first two!      If anybody wanted to photograph my life, they\'d get bored in a day. ""Here\'s Matt at home learning his lines. Here\'s Matt researching in aisle six of his local library"". A few hours of that and they\'d go home.      What I want to do is a character-driven porn movie. It\'s all going to be about characters, and the porn\'s gonna grow all out of the character\'s and it\'s going to serve as character development.      It\'s just better to be yourself than to try to be some version of what you think the other person wants.      There are people who appear in the magazines and I don\'t know who they are. I\'ve never seen anything they\'ve done and their careers are over already. They\'re famous for maybe 10 minutes. Real careers, I think, take a long time to unfold.      I\'d had people say, ""You\'ll enjoy being famous for a week, and you\'ll never enjoy it again"". But I don\'t think I had that week. I may have been working and missed that moment.      Bond is part of the system. He\'s an imperialist and a misogynist, and he laughs at killing people, and he sits there slugging martinis. It\'ll never be the same thing as this, because Bourne is a guy who is against the establishment, who is paranoid and on the run. I just think fundamentally they\'re just very different things.      The Bond character will always be anchored in the 1960s and in the values of the 1960s. It\'s so anachronistic when you put it in the world we live in today that Mike Myers made a fortune with his own spy franchise [Austin Powers] - it makes for great comedy. Bond is an imperialist and a misogynist who kills people and laughs about it, and drinks martinis and cracks jokes. Bourne is a serial monogamist whose girlfriend is dead and he does nothing but think about her. He doesn\'t have the support of gadgets, and he feels guilty for what he\'s done.      (On being seen as a \'nice\' celebrity) I don\'t hold myself to some higher standard of behavior. You don\'t have to do a lot to be seen as nice. I guess some of these people must be such rampant pricks that people are amazed when you say hello. I don\'t know why people like me, and I don\'t know if I want to know. That might be the kiss of death. I\'d rather people not know a lot about me and go see the movies.      You\'ve given an aging suburban dad the ego-boost of a lifetime. (On being named People magazine\'s Sexiest Man Alive 2007)      (On celebrity campaigns against such things as childhood poverty and disease) Look, I would much rather people were listening to politicians about this than actors. But the politicians aren\'t talking about this, you know.      (Talking about working with Robert De Niro in The Good Shepherd (2006)): I think I can say I\'m a better actor after having worked with Robert De Niro.      (On his favorite roles) Good Will Hunting (1997) is so close to my heart because my best friend [Ben Affleck] and I invented him, he\'s from Boston, and it was what we knew. The stakes were pretty high with ""Good Will Hunting"" and it worked out as best as it can in this business - people saw the movie, it got good reviews, I was happy with the finished product, and they gave us an Oscar. I am also pretty fond of ""Tom Ripley"" - playing smart and sinister is just so much fun. I wasn\'t that fond of his choice of swim trunks, though, so a few points away for that. And ""John Grady Cole"" in All the Pretty Horses (2000) was good, too. The integrity of that character is admirable. Unfortunately, I am the only one who saw that movie, so no one will get that reference.      You do the actuary tables, there\'s a one out of three chance, if not more, that McCain doesn\'t survive his first term, and it\'ll be President Palin. It\'s like a really bad Disney movie, \'The Hockey Mom.\' Oh, I\'m just a hockey mom from Alaska, and she\'s president. She\'s facing down Vladimir Putin and using the folksy stuff she learned at the hockey rink. It\'s absurd.      (On James Bond) He\'s repulsive. Bond is an imperialist, misogynist, sociopath who goes around bedding women and swilling martinis and killing people. The movies have a formula, they stick to it, and it makes them a lot of money. They know what they are doing and they\'re going to keep doing it.      [on the difference between Jason Bourne and James Bond] He\'s not like Bond, who goes on individual missions. I mean, you could make Bond movies forever, because you\'d start each film at the beginning of a new mission. But Bourne isn\'t built that way, unfortunately.      [on 9/11] That day is seared into who I am more than I\'d even like. It was weird because I stepped outside my apartment, looked up and saw it happening and then went back in and just watched CNN because I just wanted information. I remember everything about that day.      Ask anybody on the street which actors starred in the ""Ocean\'s"" movies, and they\'ll tell you it was George [Clooney] and Brad [Pitt]. I\'m \'support\' in ""Ocean\'s"". As I was in Saving Private Ryan (1998) - Tom [Hanks] carried that movie. You could accuse me of piggybacking on other people\'s brilliance more than anything.      [on the Oscars] They should give them out 10 years later, like the way they do the Hall of Fame in baseball. They do it in five years, but if you did 10 years later, if this year (2010), we were voting on what was the best picture of 2000, I think it would be much more honest. It\'s like, when you pick up great old movies and you go, why the hell didn\'t Brando win the Oscar for this one? Who won that year? Whatever the sizzle was about that year. 50 years later you\'re looking at a movie and going, this is a historic cinematic performance.      [on the possibility of a fourth Jason Bourne movie] I don\'t know, you know. I think it will be a prequel of some kind with another actor and another director before we (himself and director Paul Greengrass) do another one. I think we are probably five years away from another one. We gotta get a script.      I want to direct someday and I can\'t really pass up the chance to work with the people I\'m getting to work with. I\'ve worked with Paul Greengrass three times now, and Clint Eastwood twice, and Steven Soderbergh five or six times, and the Coen Brothers this month. As long as that keeps happening, I can\'t see myself taking time off, unless the work dried up.      Usually the scripts I get have got Brad Pitt\'s fingerprints on them, or Leonardo DiCaprio\'s.      I\'ve come to believe that the best way, if we really wanted to try to give out awards, would be to wait at least ten years.      I\'m becoming far more interested in just functionality and making sure my body is as strong as it can be so I can swing my kids around and not worry about aches and pains.      [on what kind of political leadership he supports] Somebody who believes that building a strong, solid, educated middle class is ultimately the best thing for America. Someone like FDR. There\'s a misconception that leaders lead. They don\'t. They follow. Every great movement has come from the bottom up.      [on how he would react to a pandemic in real life] I have the benefit of knowing the virologist Ian Lipkin, our technical adviser [on _Contagion_]. He\'s not the guy to talk to if you don\'t want to get paranoid. He will freak you out. But I would follow his advice during an outbreak.      Working with Steven [Soderbergh] is very different from working with anybody else. He takes the hocus-pocus out of making movies, and I like that.      I\'m always cautious about overstepping any boundaries. At the end of the day, it\'s a director\'s medium, and if they don\'t want to hear from me I just step back.      As disturbed as I am by a lot of the things that Obama has done and is doing, I would not have preferred a Romney presidency, that\'s for sure. The alternative is even more frightening.      I think the values that I have are consistent with the values I was raised with. I vote against my own self-interests constantly. I campaign against my own self-interests. If you\'re born with a silver spoon in your mouth, you\'re probably more likely to be the Koch brothers and think that you shouldn\'t pay taxes on things. I think it\'s just a question of where you come from.      [in defence of friend Ben Affleck, being criticized for agreeing to controversial casting].You know, he\'s not playing King Lear. It\'s Batman!      All you have in the end is to look back and like the choices you\'ve made.      Does [Sarah Palin] really believe that dinosaurs were here four thousand years ago? I need to know that. Because she\'s going to have the nuclear codes.      (2012) When I turned 40 I had my whole family and some friends together. I realized I had to make a toast and hadn\'t thought of anything to say. I stood up, and what came to me seemed incredibly true in the moment and even more so as time has gone by. I said, ""I think I might actually be the luckiest guy on earth. I really might be him."" And nobody in the room reflexively said, ""Bullshit,"" because I am so lucky to have Lucy, my kids, my friends and this job. It\'s been an unbelievable life. So I\'m just looking for health and to stay in this groove as long as I can.      (2012) One of the scariest things I\'ve ever had to do was the underwater scene in the second Bourne movie, where the car goes into the river and I\'ve lost the love of my life. I didn\'t want to do that at all. So I wouldn\'t be constantly aware of how scared I am of drowning, I had to go to a pool with this great stunt guy and dive master a couple of times a week for a month or so to train me to relax underwater without an oxygen mask and with a blindfold and, later, to do simple tasks underwater like tying a shoe... After we shot for one day, that night I woke up probably four times gasping for breath, thinking I was drowning. It was terrible. When you make movies, you end up being trained to do really weird things you don\'t do anywhere else.      (2012, on turning down roles) Having to say no to Avatar (2009) was tough because I particularly wanted to work with James Cameron, and still do, because he\'s fantastic. He knew he was the star of that movie and that everyone was going to go see it anyway. When he said, ""Look, I\'m offering it to you, but if you say no, the movie doesn\'t need you,"" I remember thinking, Oh God, not only do I have to say no because of scheduling, but he\'s going to make a star out of some guy who\'s going to start taking jobs from me later... Milk (2008) was another hard one because I was excited it would have been for Gus Van Sant, and I would have had the chance to do scenes with Sean Penn. They pushed the schedule and it ran into the slot for Green Zone (2010). Steven Soderbergh\'s mantra is ""The movie gets the right person; the right actor gets the part,"" but I was like, ""Shit, no. That was my part."" But when I saw Milk (2008), Josh Brolin was so fucking good that I knew Soderbergh was right. Way back, Gus and I talked about my doing Brokeback Mountain (2005) with Joaquin Phoenix, but I had just done The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) and All the Pretty Horses (2000), so I said, ""Gus, let\'s do it in a couple of years. I just did a gay movie and a cowboy movie. I can\'t do a gay cowboy movie now."" The right actor got the part. Heath Ledger was magnificent.      (2012) I learned that I am afraid of heights. When I was doing Syriana, they arranged for my wife, Lucy, and me to go up to watch the sunset over the Arabian Peninsula from the top of that seven-star Dubai hotel that\'s shaped like a sail, the Burj Al Arab. So we go to the very top-60 stories or something-we\'re given champagne, and we go, ""Oh my God, this is great."" But as I started to walk toward the edge, my legs locked up. I was absolutely frozen. I completely jumped my neocortex and went straight to this primal, full lizard-brain fear state. Lucy was walking all around the edge, while I was about to collapse from fear. She thought it was hysterical.      [on working with Robert De Niro in The Good Shepard] I learned a lot of things I didn\'t know and I remembered a lot of things I\'d forgotten and that ""disappearing"" into work for ten years and working constantly... you can get into some bad habits.      [How he felt after winning his first Oscar]I remember going back home and I couldn\'t sleep so I was just sitting there looking at the award and I remember thinking very clearly and said to myself thank God I didn\'t fuck anyone over for this.      [Describing what he did and how he felt after winning an Oscar for Best Screenplay for Good Will Hunting] I remember going back home and I couldn\'t sleep so I was just sitting there looking at the award and I remember thinking very clearly and said to myself thank God I didn\'t fuck anyone over for this. I felt so blessed because I won it at such a young age. I couldn\'t imagine how it would feel to chased it my entire career and not ever getting it.      The ingredients of my ideal taco, oh my god. Fantastic question. My ideal taco is actually the taco I\'m not supposed to have which is the taco we have on taco night at my house. It\'s the crunchy corn shell with the good meat, just ground beef in there. It\'s all about the layering. The meats gotta be hot, and the cheese goes on first so that it melts. And then you\'re gonna get in there with a little bit of tomato and lettuce but not too much cause it\'s not a salad, it\'s a taco, and then you\'re gonna throw some avocado on top and some sour cream and then a bunch of cholula. I don\'t know if you know what cholula hot sauce is but it\'s the best. Throw a bunch of cholula on there, maybe squeeze some lime on top, and go to town.      [on the difference of getting in shape from the first Bourne movie to the most recent one] It\'s a lot harder. I\'m 45 years old, everything is harder. I remember during the first Bourne movie I was 29 and I boxed for six months, I was lifting weights and that\'s just one of the hard parts. A lot of the hard parts was the diet: I love eating and going out, drinking good wine, eating good food with my wife, so that was my sacrifice but that\'s not a lot to sacrifice because ultimately you get to make a movie you really want to make.      [5 ways he is not Jason Bourne] First all the languages he speaks, they\'re all languages that I wish I spoke, the way he fights, I certainly can\'t fight like that, his a lot more tortured than I am, I\'ve got a great wife, and he definitely doesn\'t have one, and I\'ve got kids.      [on living with 5 women, his wife and daughters]Yeah it\'s a lot of estrogen, sometimes I need to talk a walk by myself.      [Why he came back to do another Bourne film] I said I wouldn\'t do it without Paul Greengrass and it was always we\'d talk about, we\' re always looking for projects for us to do together and after a while we felt like ""we\'re kind of like dicks if we don\'t do another Bourne film. So when we knew we wanted to it became a question of what would the movie be? And what\'s the story?, How would the characters interact? so it took a few more years to figure it out.      [on the best advice, his been given] when I was younger, everybody told me not to be an actor and to this day I say that to people who come up to me and say I\'m thinking about going into acting, what\'d you think? I say absolutely not. It\'s a terrible idea don\'t do it, because that\'s what everyone said to me and I think if you\'re going to make it in this business that is full of rejection and hardship you need to believe in yourself despite what everybody you love and trust tells you.      [advice from his high school acting teacher Gerry Speca] five words: just do your work kid. And he repeated that so many times to me and that is what I can always retreat to, that\'s my touch stone, when in doubt, just focus on the work, if everything on the movie is going wrong, I\'ll just make sure my work is tight and done.Salary (10)The Good Old Boys\xa0(1995)      $20,000       Rounders\xa0(1998)      $600,000       The Talented Mr. Ripley\xa0(1999)      $5,000,000       The Legend of Bagger Vance\xa0(2000)      $7,000,000       All the Pretty Horses\xa0(2000)      $5,500,000       Ocean\'s Eleven\xa0(2001)      $5,000,000       The Bourne Identity\xa0(2002)      $10,000,000       The Brothers Grimm\xa0(2005)      $10,000,000       The Bourne Ultimatum\xa0(2007)      $20,000,000       The Martian\xa0(2015)      $15,000,000 to $25,000,000          if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nFranka Potente ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 46 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(2)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(23)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(17)\xa0|Salary\xa0(1)  Overview (2)Date of Birth22\xa0July1974,\xa0Münster, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany Height5\'\xa08½""\xa0(1.74\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Franka Potente was born on 22 July 1974 in the German city of Münster, to Hildegard, a medical assistant, and Dieter Potente, a teacher, and raised in the nearby town of Dülmen. After her graduation in 1994, she went to the Otto-Falckenberg-Schule, a drama school in Munich, but soon broke off to study at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute in New York. After a notable debut in Nach Fünf im Urwald (1995), the role of the heroine in Lola rennt (1998), directed by her then longtime companion Tom Tykwer was her national breakthrough. After some other successful movies in Germany, she starred in several Hollywood productions, most prominently The Bourne Identity (2002) and The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and lived one year in Los Angeles. After her return to Berlin, she continues working with German and international directors.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       fippi2000          Spouse (1) Derek Richardson (2012            - present)\xa0(2 children)          Trade Mark (1)        Ever-changing hair colorTrivia (23)      Her last name ""Potente"" (pronounced Poe-ten-the) means ""powerful"" in Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese.

Says she was discovered as an actress in a public restroom. She was in a bar when she noticed she was constantly stared at by some woman. She decided to leave but went to the restroom before. The woman followed her and again stared at her through the mirror. Suddenly she asked ""How would you describe yourself in one sentence?"". Turns out she was a casting agent.      Has a brother who is three years younger and was very sick when he was born. She says she always was very jealous on the way he was cosseted and that was why she often behaved like a clown and arranged performances to get more attention, and that this was why she decided to become an actress.Tom Tykwer wrote Lola rennt (1998) specifically for her, with the intention of casting her as Lola.      In spring 2002, she broke up with longtime boyfriend Tom Tykwer.      Knows how to fence.      Disliked the strict fitness regimen and diet that were required for The Bourne Identity (2002).

I guess every kid wants to - we just want to have access - free access.      I think working with Johnny Depp was very intimidating. It was my fault though. I mean he\'s a total cool nice, nice guy, but I was just so, I don\'t know, overpowered by his presence. Like he\'s a very mystic person. He\'s older so I never really warmed up around him. I was so stiff.      I said, \'Wouldn\'t it be great if Matt Damon\'s character fell in love with a girl with a real butt?\' They were like, \'Yeah sure, sure - here\'s your personal trainer.\'      I always performed when I was a child. My parents got very annoyed, because my brother and I had our little bedrooms upstairs, and I would plaster the house with posters with arrows pointing upstairs.      I think when I\'m in love, I really am very good with calling, little faxes, and visiting and I really put a lot of effort into it. I\'m really not the one that\'s not available because of work and I\'m very sad when I actually leave.      I choose my work very carefully, always for the script and the director, and I don\'t think that\'s going to change. My work is like a house. It\'s built on very strong poles.      I don\'t like actors who try to talk directors into making their part bigger and that\'s really lame.      Everybody is great when things are great. It\'s the \'not great\' stuff that matters.      My background is a small town with no movie theater. So... I always pictured myself onstage. I went to acting school and learned all the skills. I left early because I did my first movie and discovered that I really loved the minimalistic work with the camera.      I just want to be able to sit on grass as long as I want to, without anybody telling me to leave. Everything is so restricted, here, in that you actually have to stand behind a line, you can\'t go up the Canyon and enjoy the view.      I don\'t really care where I work, actually, because you know making a movie is like living in movie world. There\'s such a secluded world, and the director is the king ruling the country, and everybody\'s building this little town to speak in symbolism.      I think I\'m a really good partner and very sensitive to the other person\'s feelings. I want somebody else to be comfortable, to understand about my job, and if they want to come on a set and see me work, they always can.      I think actors are divided into two groups: one that wants to be an actor to become famous and rich, and the other that wants to be an actor because they have to be. I\'m more in the second group.      I never consciously said, \'I want to be an actor.\' It sounds stupid, but it\'s kind of like being a painter or something. You don\'t say, \'From today on I\'m going to be a painter.\' It\'s not something conscious - you\'ve just been painting pictures all your life.      I\'m so uncomfortable, especially in emotional situations, having to say sentences that don\'t feel right. As an actor - or really, as any kind of person sensitive to it.      I\'ve published one book before, and now I\'m writing a book of essays and stories about life in Tokyo.

Did not make his first screen appearance until he was thirty-six years old.Personal Quotes (6)      (On landing his role in Matewan) That was my first feature film, but it came in kind of an interesting way. My wife [Marianne] was also an actor. When we were living in New York, she answered a backstage ad for an NYU student\'s film, and that turned out to be Nancy Savoca. So Marianne did Nancy\'s half-hour junior black-and-white piece. Then she and Nancy and Rich, Nancy\'s husband-we all four became real good friends from that experience. Then Nancy worked on Brother From Another Planet when John [Sayles] was shooting that. And she was aware that John beforehand had lost financing. He wanted to do Matewan, but lost the financing, so he went on to do Brother From Another Planet. So Nancy gave John my name, and said, ""When the time comes for Matewan, take a look at this guy."" So that\'s kind of how that came about. It was an audition in midtown. I went up and read a couple of scenes. And then some months passed. I went to London to do a West End production with Harold Pinter-it was a Tennessee Williams play, Sweet Bird Of Youth, directed by Harold Pinter and starring Lauren Bacall. So in the seven months that I was over in England, news came. I got a callback to read some more scenes. So we did the Sunday matinée, and I had to get on a plane, fly to the States, do the audition, get back on the plane, fly back for Tuesday night\'s performance. I had virtually noooo sleep. I was really on a high just in anticipation of the audition. And then during that Tuesday-night performance, I came really, really close to fainting onstage because I was so tuckered.      (On Money Train) We had just moved to Kingston, I think in \'94. I think I had gone into New York and auditioned for one or two characters in that script, and we bought this little house here that we still live in. And financially, we had no business buying this house. We were scared to death. So it was an opportunity to make some money and do another film role, and it\'s something I thought would be very challenging. It turned out to be... Certainly not a pleasant character. Sometimes you go into those dark areas, and that\'s what you\'re called to do. It was a pretty wicked, awful character, considering what he did. I just really can\'t say that was an enjoyable role. It was more of an opportunity, and kind of survival. Something for a number of reasons that I just had to do.      (On Adaptation) The audition I did was very, very unusual, in that when I read the script, I just saw so many possibilities and ways to play a scene. If you\'re not familiar with the audition process-you\'re lucky if you get a second reading of the character. I went to the audition and pleaded with Spike to please allow me to show him four or five interpretations of a scene. And he let me do that. We did four, possibly five scenes where I showed him different ways I thought this could be played. Then once I was cast, and we were shooting the film, when the finished product came out, that\'s how Spike directed me. He would say in a particular scene, ""Okay, here you are picking up Susan Orlean at her hotel, and you\'re going into the Everglades or whatever. Okay, on first meeting her, you could be terribly intimidated. Here you are, this Florida redneck cracker meeting this intellectual New York journalist, and you\'re completely intimidated. Okay, now play it like you\'re the smartest guy in the world, and she\'s lucky to have this time to spend with you. So you\'re very confident."" So on and so forth. So we\'d play all those different variations, and then when it came to editing the film, it was up to Spike to choose what take he wanted. And that became a real surprise to me at the premiere when I saw the film, because I didn\'t know what take he was going to use.      (On landing Lonesome Dove) It\'s a mystery-I know they auditioned a lot of folks in L.A., and if I remember correctly, they had a handful of actors they were going to read in New York. And why or how I got the opportunity to audition for Lonesome Dove, I have no idea. But I knew that character of July Johnson was just-seemed to fit me like a glove. And I worked my tail off on that audition. And also, somehow, somewhere getting the news that the director felt pretty sure he had cast the role of July Johnson, that just spurred me on to try and give the best audition I could ever give at that time. And I guess it worked out.      (On his role in The Town) It\'s like one scene. But a great scene, I think. This is a great adaptation from a Chuck Hogan book called Prince Of Thieves. I play Ben Affleck\'s father, who is doing five life terms for a Brinks heist that I committed and killed a couple of the guards. But this story is generational. It\'s thieves who pass down their triumphs and mistakes to the next generation, so that they don\'t make the same mistake that the previous-like I had made. So Ben is visiting me in Walpole Prison. We spent just a great day with this prison visit scene. And Ben was kind enough to assemble 13 minutes of film that involved every reference to my character before my scene, so I could see how other people saw him before I played him.      The Bourne Identity. It\'s pretty amazing. I had the Bourne script for a good month and a half, and I knew I was going to Prague to shoot my segment of the film. So two weeks before I\'m off to Prague, I get a call from the production company, and they say ""Look, forget the script. We\'ve got a lot of re-writing to do, and we\'ll send you a script as soon as we can."" So a week goes by, and I\'m getting pretty freaked out, because here I am, and I don\'t know what the heck I\'m going to do. And I\'m not a quick line-reader. I don\'t learn lines real quickly. So a week went by, and it\'s a week before I go to Prague, and I get another script. I no sooner set that script down, than within an hour, production\'s calling saying ""Forget that script. We\'re still in re-writes. We\'ll send you something as soon as we can."" I flew to Prague without a script. I didn\'t know what the heck I was going to do. I think it\'s fair to say-I think it\'s been out in the atmosphere enough that people know that\'s just how the shoot went. And I think it\'s kind of how the second shoot went. We were working 12-14-hour days, and then I would find myself hanging around the set for another hour asking anybody, ""Do we have pages for tomorrow?"" And it was a great, great example of finding that survival gear. I mean literally, that gear to work in that kind of situation. All those guys, that support team that I had around me while we were tracking down Bourne, we\'d get these pages of technical jargon, and we\'d have to go off to a quiet corner for a half-hour and just jam and learn these scenes and make them look interesting, and make them look like we knew what we were talking about. So that was quite an experience. Boy, somebody was watching out for me, because at the same time, I\'m going through jet-lag, and doing a lot of physical scene work, and I would get maybe four hours of sleep a night.

Owen is typically cast as characters whose primary traits are a balance of physical strength, intellect, conflicting soul but forceful will. He is best known to film audiences for his work in Children of Men (2006), Closer (2004) and his breakout part in Croupier (1998). He recently portrayed Ernest Hemingway in the HBO made-for-TV movie Hemingway & Gellhorn (2012).Born in Coventry, in England\'s West Midlands county, on 3 October 1964, Owen is the fourth of five brothers. He is the son of Pamela (Cotton) and Jess Owen, a country and western singer. His father abandoned the family when he was three years old, and Owen was subsequently raised by his mother and stepfather. He attended Binley Park Comprehensive School and joined the youth theater at 13 after playing the scene-stealing role of the Artful Dodger in a production of ""Oliver!""Acting was not his first choice as a profession, but he changed his mind and went on to graduate from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1987. Owen proceeded to join the Young Vic Theatre Company, where he honed his craft while performing in a number of Shakespearean productions.Clive made his film debut in the British-made Vroom (1988) co-starring with David Thewlis as two fellows who restore a classic American car and take off on the road. Within two years, Clive became a full-fledged TV star playing devilish rogue Stephen Crane in Chancer (1990). However, the now-sought-after Clive abandoned the star-making part at the height of the show\'s popularity because of unwanted invasion of privacy and his fear of typecasting. His next project raised more than a few eyebrows when he filmed Close My Eyes (1991) in which he played a brother who acts on his incestuous desires for his older sister. Clive\'s reputation as a lovable shyster was completely shattered and he lost profitable commercial endorsements following the film\'s release. Offers fell off for the next two years as a result. But the persistent Clive carried on with stage work, including the role of a bisexual in a production of Noël Coward\'s ""Design For Living."" He returned to TV at that time as well and played a number of roles in both mini-movies and series.In 1997, Clive had a huge hit on the London stage with ""Closer,"" a cynical, contemporary ensemble piece about relationships. Controversy surrounded him again in the film role of Max in Bent (1997) playing a brash, reckless homosexual lothario in decadent pre-war Germany who finds unconditional love while interned in a Nazi war camp. His biggest film break, however, was in Mike Hodges\' Croupier (1998), as a struggling writer-turned-casino employee who gets in over his head with a femme fatale scam artist. English audiences stayed away in droves but the U.S. embraced the film and Hollywood took notice of Clive, who was virtually unknown outside of England. Despite playing detective Ross Tanner in a series of successful ""Second Sight"" mini-movies and finding critical acclaim on stage with ""The Day in the Death of Joe Egg"" in 2001, Clive has focused primarily on film, including the offbeat Brit romantic comedy Greenfingers (2000), the classy and popular Robert Altman film Gosford Park (2001), the Matt Damon star-vehicle The Bourne Identity (2002), and the title role in King Arthur (2004). He has since reached the top rungs of the Hollywood ladder with the film version of his stage smash Closer (2004), in which he received an Academy Award nomination and won the BAFTA award for ""Supporting Actor""; opposite Denzel Washington in Inside Man (2006); and alongside Julianne Moore and Michael Caine in Children of Men (2006). Upcoming is his portrayal of Sir Walter Raleigh opposite Cate Blanchett\'s Elizabeth I in the film Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007).Owen is married to Sarah-Jane Fenton, who played Juliet to his Romeo at the Young Vic in 1998. The couple has two daughters.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net          Spouse (1) Sarah-Jane Fenton (6 March\xa01995            - present)\xa0(2 children)          Trade Mark (4)        Deep baritone voice        Sardonic sense of humor        Frequently plays tough characters who use intelligence rather than strength        Many of his roles have him wearing a long coat, usually well worn and tatteredTrivia (30)      Had a recurring role on a series of BMW commercials as their mysterious driver.

He says, ""I don\'t know why, but no one else has ever had such an effect on me. I didn\'t have most of his work. I had everything."" In the 1970s, when Bowie was changing his appearance and style with every album, Owen would re-dye his hair whatever color Bowie\'s was at the time.      Turned down the role as The Driver for BMW twice. He was sent a copy of the script for the first ad, read it and was impressed by its presentation. He immediately accepted the role, jumped on a plane to LA, and was whisked away to the set of the first ad as soon as he landed.      Two of his brothers, Alan and Lee, became musicians and released a single called ""Heartbeat.""      Met his wife at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art while doing Romeo and Juliet.

Voted #5 in Elle (France) Magazine\'s ""15 Sexiest Men"" poll (June 2007).      Is the patron for the Electric Palace Cinema in Harwich, England.      Was named Empire Magazines #25 in the list of 100 Sexiest Stars(2007).      Lobbied for the role of Lord Asriel in The Golden Compass (2007).      After Russell Crowe turned down the role, he was chosen by Jerry Bruckheimer over Antoine Fuqua\'s choice of Daniel Craig for the lead role in King Arthur (2004). Owen was later turned down for the role of Lord Asriel in The Golden Compass (2007) in favor of Daniel Craig in spite of offering to screen test for the part.      Although his \'official\' date of birth is 1964, the News of the World published a birth certificate stating it as 1962 as part of an article about the real age of movie stars.      Got the the role of King Arthur (2004) after Russell Crowe, Mel Gibson and Hugh Jackman turned it down and after producer Jerry Bruckheimer vetoed the director\'s choice of a then comparatively unknown Daniel Craig because he was convinced Owen was going to be the next James Bond.      Admitted in a Newsweek interview to promote The International (2009) that he has considered submitting false trivia about himself (""I once talked to someone about putting something on IMDB"") and was surprised at how seriously people took it. In the same interview he also claimed he doesn\'t eat biscuits because \'He-men don\'t need biscuits.\'.      In an interview published in the Daily Express, he said that he was terrified of badgers. In a subsequent interview in Newsweek, he denied being afraid of them and said it was a joke.      Developing a remake of popular 70s children\'s TV series Catweazle (1970) as a starring vehicle and as co-producer. [December 2009]      Currently filming The Boys Are Back (2009) in Adelaide, Australia. [October 2008]      Member of the \'Official Competition\' jury at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival in 2016.Personal Quotes (19)      I\'ve never been interested in playing good guys. I\'m always attracted to dangerous characters. Those roles are usually far more interesting and I hold no fears about doing them. With my character in Croupier (1998), you\'re never really sure where he\'s coming from. He\'s not really a good guy or a bad guy. But people generally aren\'t, are they?      The sexiest part of the body is the eyes. Corny, but that\'s what I believe. They\'re what connect us as human beings.      Theatre uses a different energy. It\'s like going to the gym and having a vigorous workout. But every few years is enough because I love filming. I am a real film animal.      When I was 10 or 11, I played the Artful Dodger in a school production of \'Oliver. From that point forward, I said I wanted to be an actor. Nobody in my family took it seriously, but I saw no other path. I was a cocky little kid. This one teacher said: \'You\'re a working-class kid from Coventry. What do you know?\'      Theater is like exercise. I feel it\'s healthy. But I don\'t love it as much as movies. A bad experience in the theater can be so depressing. You\'ve got to do it every night, even if the production is not working.      The lighter stuff has got to be really well written for me, or it just doesn\'t get me going. There\'s something to play if there\'s conflict going on. Whatever that conflict is, that\'s where drama is; if the character is grappling with something you\'ve got something to play, there\'s layers to it. And when that isn\'t there it\'s ... less interesting.      [Talking about Daniel Craig]: ""I think when Craig first took the (James Bond) part he got a pretty rough ride, which to a certain extent is inevitable because there are so many different people who have so many different ideas about something like that. You are never going to please everybody. The thing that is really exciting is that he is a proper actor. He is not shallow or posing, they have cast a really serious actor and I think that when the film comes out everyone will see what a great choice he was"".      On his fear of badgers: I\'ve never been bitten by one or anything like that, they just look evil to me. Even watching The Wind in the Willows they scared me. It was like the Devil staring straight into my eyes. It\'s something I\'ve never outgrown. Even today, just the thought of badgers absolutely terrifies me. Hell to me is a room full of badgers.      Bond was the best thing that never happened to me. I was never in the running but the more I said so, the more people thought I had it in the bag. What\'s so funny about it all is my career in Britain was in really bad shape at the time, but my agents pretty much built me a new one in America by playing up all the Bond stories. All I had to do was keep on telling people I was never going to be Bond. I\'d like to think I made it on talent, but it\'s really just dumb luck. If I hadn\'t worn that tux in Croupier (1998), I\'d still be begging for the parts Robson Green turned down on cop shows.      I don\'t ""do"" emotion. Emotions are overrated. I\'m more interested in creating a presence.      (On Bond) It\'s easy to keep saying no to a role you\'re not being offered. If they really had offered? I don\'t know. It\'s possible I would have said yes. It\'s possible. But they never asked so we\'ll never really know.      I\'ve heard people say I have a dull and monotonous voice, but the truth is that I put all my effort into communicating to the audience via my eyes. An actor can say so much with their eyes. I would have loved to have been an actor in the days of silent movies. Sounding interesting disinterests me. Looking interesting is another matter entirely.      I got in a cab in Glasgow years ago and this quite surly cabdriver says to me, \'You\'re that actor, aren\'t you? You get paid to lie, don\'t you? That\'s what actors are, aren\'t they? Professional bullsh***ers.\' It had quite an effect on me. I f***ing get paid to lie. . . . I walked out of there and I spent a bit of time thinking about it. And then I realized I think it\'s the opposite: It\'s an opportunity to tell the truth. I try to do that in everything I do. And whether you like a movie I\'m in or not, I want you to believe me. More than admire me or think I was brilliantly skillful, I want you to believe me.      [on bad scripts he is reading] These are films that are funded and ready to go - expensive movies. You\'re amazed that people are funding them. I start to think it\'s me, that I\'m being too choosy.      (On his plans for Catweazle (1970)) Making the film (The Boys Are Back (2009)) made me realise I\'ve not made many films my own children can see, and I want them to see what their old man does for a living. When I was a kid, Catweazle (1970) was the bees\' knees, the best thing on TV. I didn\'t want to be Cedric or the other kid, I wanted to grow up to be just like Catweazle. It\'s my dream role. You could say my whole career has just been a rehearsal for Catweazle. It (the character\'s look) is a bit of a problem with the Lancombe contract, but if it comes to choice between them, it\'ll have to be Catweazle. I hope it doesn\'t come to that! Maybe they can do before and after adverts - with Catweazle (1970) the before!      Before I became an actor, I remember how I hated chickens. I was sick when I even saw one. But all that is over now, for acting has shown me how foolish it was. I have learned to love chickens, to love their flesh, their voice. One day, when I\'m through with acting, I\'ll go home to look after the chickens that I love so much. That\'s what being an actor has done for me.      People keep on saying I missed my chance with not being James Bond, but my films still appear with the tedious inevitability of an unloved season.      That\'s the best place to be, both excited and scared. What\'s the worst thing that can happen? The worst thing that can happen is that I\'ll be bad. I\'ve been bad before - I\'ll be bad again.      I like the high-wire act, playing someone who is not entirely straightforward, not something easy, palatable.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['Jason Bourne', '""Jason Bourne was part of a project called Treadstone, where agents were turned into ultimate assassins.

His difficulties regaining memory are magnified by the fact that prior to the incident when he was shot, his training program and his job had seriously altered his mental state and essentially made him a different person. Memory loss theme persists through each movie with Jason trying, and having difficulty, to remember certain mysterious episodes of his life as an assassin. With Jason being out in the open, many loose ends of things he worked on are left unprotected, and that touches some of the highest circles of power including secret government agencies and criminal organizations who perceive Jason to be a threat to themselves.

I have grown extremely tired of the typical formula spy film like Bond, or
the juvenile stunt exhibition ""Triple X."" There have been a bare handful
of
spy films that feature relatively realistic spy thrillers, especially
recently with a concentration on spectacular movies that have less
substance
than cotton candy.<br><br>Besides ""The Bourne Identity,"" ""Ronin"" is the only other recent spy movie
I
can think of that didn't feature skydiving, bungie jumping, skiing
downhill
while shooting innumerable bad guys, laser pens, cars with ejection seats,
or silicone breasted women with names you'd be vaguely embarrassed to say
in
front of your mother. Most of the crap that passes for an espionage film
has
no plot or reason for existing other than to meet a quota of explosions
and
cleavage in order to draw the summer action film crowd.<br><br>While ""Bourne"" does not have a particularly deep plot, it is consistent
and
focused. The focus is entirely upon Bourne and how he is to deal with
having
no memory of his past, being hunted without knowing why. Some people have
complained about being confused by the movie. I for one, do not need to
have
everything spelled out since in many cases this smacks of unreality in the
first place; the essence of espionage is drawing conclusions from very
sketchy information. If you can't handle a little of that, you probably
should stick to Disney films or TV's Scooby Doo where everything is
explained in the end. We never find out about what is in the case in
""Ronin""
and I can live without some information being filled in about Bourne's
past.<br><br>To those who have moaned about the incompatibility of the book and the
movie, seek help. There are probably several things that work in the book
that would either be boring and take too much screen time to explain, or
would be viewed as cliche to modern screen audiences. As I remember, I
liked
the book, and I definitely like this movie. I view any movie adaptation as
an interpretation of the book rather than a translation from words to
pictures anyway.<br><br>As for realism, most of the action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets
are to be seen, no incredibly lovely models fall madly in bed with Bourne,
and the hero shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very
high level of training and competance. As someone who has trained in
martial
arts for over 10 years, unrealistic fight scenes are a pet peeve. The
fights
in ""Bourne"" are fast, nasty, and very realistic while still being
entertaining for the layman. (And yes, taking a gun away from some idiot
who
is standing well within your striking radius without getting shot is
definitely doable, though I had serious doubts until we tested it for
ourselves with plastic dart guns in the dojo several years
ago).<br><br>While not being perfect, ""The Bourne Identity"" is, simply put, several
grades above the typical spy film. Being focused on an individual level
rather than involving itself huge political ramifications lends it another
layer of respectability rather than detracting from it as some comments
have
implied since it remains a human problem on a comprehensible scale. The
mysteries that are left are bigger mysteries for Bourne than us, and I
think
should be viewed as intentional omissions rather than loose ends. The
implausibilities are kept to a minimum and the realism to as high a level
as
possible while still being spectacular enough to meet the expectations of
the genre.

James Bond and Ethan Hunt take notice. ""The Bourne Identity"" is my new
standard for contemporary spy thrillers.  Gone (or almost gone) are the
special effects that James and Ethan rely on all too heavily. Hell, in those
franchises the special effects have virtually replaced story and characters.
""The Bourne Identity"" has a very straightforward story to tell, a mystery
that slowly unravels. Spycraft is not all about technical gizmos, but
requires human brains and human brawn (and a fair amount of gunplay and car
chases). <br><br>Set in various locales in Switzerland and France during the winter much of
the visuals for ""The Bourne Identity"" are gray and damp. That's a plus,
Monte Carlo and like locales can get boring. Mat Damon is great as Jason
Bourne, fished from the Mediterranean mostly dead by gunshot wounds. A total
amnesiac, he slowly realizes that he possesses the deadly skills of a
well-trained assassin, and that someone is out to kill him. Franka Potente
is equally good as the young woman swept up in his life and forced to run
with him. Run or be killed.<br><br>I can't say enough good things about this movie. Doug Limon, thanks, you did
a great job.

Next to Ronin, this is one of the best action / spy movies that I've
ever seen. I heard a lot of good critics, but didn't know what to think
about it. I only saw it 2 years after it first appeared and I'm a
little disappointed that I didn't go watch it in the cinema.<br><br>I'm not too keen on movies like James Bond and other stuff in this
genre, but this one is a lot better. Normally you see the ""super hero""
using all kinds of weird gadgets, driving extremely fast sports cars
and sleeping with ladies who look more like prostitutes than being
normal women.<br><br>Jason Bourne however doesn't have all this things, which makes this
movie a lot more realistic. The fights are fast and very realistic but
still entertaining. The action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets,
no incredibly willing women sharing his bed... Our hero even shows
definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of
training and competence. In the meanwhile he has to deal with amnesia,
while being hunted without knowing why. In the end this is still a man
which you can identify yourself with.<br><br>I would say: Go watch it when you are a fan of movies like Ronin, don't
watch it if you think James Bond is a person who you can bump into on
the streets when going out. Personally I would award this movie with an
8/10.

This is a great movie. Unfortunately one reviewer has no knowledge
towards the field of psychology. One reviewer states it's a good movie
based on a completely false occurrence, that being amnesia in general.
They say it doesn't exist and nobody loses their memory of their
identity while retaining knowledge of everything else. This is untrue.
I am currently studying to become a psychologist, it's called
Dissociative Amnesia. -Dissociative Amnesia - formerly Psychogenic
Amnesia, is a pervasive loss of memory of significant personal
information. This disorder is characterized by a blocking out of
critical personal information. Dissociative amnesia, unlike other types
of amnesia, does not result from other medical trauma, such as a blow
to the head. The predominant disturbance is one or more episodes of
inability to recall important personal information, usually of a
traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by
ordinary forgetfulness - Just to prove, it's true, and does happen. So
this movie is not based on something made up, similar losses of memory
do happen to people. Especially people in a job such as that. So,
concluding, this is a great action film, I truly enjoyed this movie
along with the sequel, The Bourne Supremacy. Both are I think going to
be a couple of the best movies we will see this decade (2000-2010)

This story has been done several times in the past, most recently in ""A
Long Kiss Goodnight"". It's also true that Doug Liman and the producers
created their own Jason Bourne mythology,since this movie is different
in many ways to the book. But the truth is Liman takes an old story and
puts a new fast paced spin on it.<br><br>Matt Damon stars as the enigmatic assassin who just wants to figure out
who he is. As he travels from city to city he's followed by CIA agents
who want to dispose of him to save their own jobs. He's helped along
the way by Marie played by the brilliant Franka Potente. Together they
come face to face with the people that want them dead.<br><br>The cast is great and so is the story. This film should be on

The crew of a fishing vessel find a body floating in the middle of the

bullets on the back and a Swiss bank account implanted in the hip of
the body. The 'body' indeed is not dead but unconscious: he is Jason
Bourne (Matt Dammon), a CIA secret and very well prepared agent with

the American Consulate. There he meets Marie Helena Kreutz (Franka
Potente, from 'Run Lola Run' and 'Anatomy') and they two together will
pass to the most spectacular actions along the film. The great Matt
Dammon and Franka Potente are perfect. This movie is everything that
'Tripple X' and 'Die Another Day' intended to be and did not offer to
the viewer: a non-stop and excellent action film. Fortunately this

to perform the role of Jason Bourne and spoil this film, as usual. It
is amazing the filmography of Matt Dammon. This great actor knows how
to select good screenplays. I am not familiarized with the filmography
of Franka Potente ( I believe most of them has not been released on VHS

performance very much. One thing that called my attention along this

While the action genre is as believable 
and formulaic as an NSync 
song, The Bourne Identity takes a much 
needed step to the side to watch oncoming 
traffic. Subtle, yet still holding true to multiple 
action formulas (lots of fighting, cool 
weaponry, and chase scenes), this film 
presents a new era of action film making 
which could be all the wave. Matt Damon, 
who has the unfortunate nature of watching 
his less talented friend Ben Affleck gain
notoriety for trash movies, is an excellent 
choice as the CIA operative turned amnesiac 
Jason Bourne. <br><br>His presence is both believable and realistic, 
like he is some guy who looks like a bookworm. 
While the film's cinematography was rather 
average, there are moments in the film 
which presents actual anxiety. The viewer 
knows something is coming, yet the genuine 
far exhibited by the characters makes those 
moments so interesting. I thought this would 
be some average action, but I walked away 
amazed. Franka Potente played the role of 
Marie perfectly, even though some prettier 
and less talented actress could have been 
placed in this film. Kudos to the producers 
for the casting choice. 7.4/10

I can sympathize with reviewers who had read the book and were
disappointed by this film and the liberties it apparently took with the
story. I've had that happen with books I've enjoyed and it can spoil a
film you might otherwise have liked. I never read the book, so I was
able to appreciate this film on its own merits - slick, tough,
fast-paced and refreshingly devoid of the kind of nonsense that has
made the Bond films harder and harder to sit through. <br><br>I'm especially impressed by the fights, which, as other reviewers have
pointed out, are among the most believable martial-arts-based fight
scenes ever seen. No big grand gestures or Olympian kicks - just fast,
nasty moves designed to inflict maximum damage with minimum effort.<br><br>The cast is uniformly good - even Damon, who is no fave of mine, comes
across believably as a man who's trained to hold it all in, but isn't
sure what it all is that he's holding in. Cooper, Cox and Owen shine in
their all-too-brief screen time. Potente is attractive in a real person
sort of way (sigh of relief for this genre) and possesses an inner
strength that makes her character's actions and reactions ring truer
than what we'd get from the traditional Hollywood eye-candy girlfriend
these films normally feature.<br><br>From the gritty bowels of the trawler, where Damon awakens to his
situation, to the field where he confronts his most deadly assailant,
the locations are the antithesis of the travel poster hotspots that
Bond so frequently visits. Despite its breakneck pace (handled so well
by Liman and so poorly in the sequel by his protégé), the film manages
to convey a sense of melancholy that lifts it a bit above the average
action thriller. Sorry book fans - it may not be your cup of Ludlum,
but it's still a damn fine little action flick.

I have grown extremely tired of the typical formula spy film like Bond, or
the juvenile stunt exhibition ""Triple X."" There have been a bare handful
of
spy films that feature relatively realistic spy thrillers, especially
recently with a concentration on spectacular movies that have less
substance
than cotton candy.<br><br>Besides ""The Bourne Identity,"" ""Ronin"" is the only other recent spy movie
I
can think of that didn't feature skydiving, bungie jumping, skiing
downhill
while shooting innumerable bad guys, laser pens, cars with ejection seats,
or silicone breasted women with names you'd be vaguely embarrassed to say
in
front of your mother. Most of the crap that passes for an espionage film
has
no plot or reason for existing other than to meet a quota of explosions
and
cleavage in order to draw the summer action film crowd.<br><br>While ""Bourne"" does not have a particularly deep plot, it is consistent
and
focused. The focus is entirely upon Bourne and how he is to deal with
having
no memory of his past, being hunted without knowing why. Some people have
complained about being confused by the movie. I for one, do not need to
have
everything spelled out since in many cases this smacks of unreality in the
first place; the essence of espionage is drawing conclusions from very
sketchy information. If you can't handle a little of that, you probably
should stick to Disney films or TV's Scooby Doo where everything is
explained in the end. We never find out about what is in the case in
""Ronin""
and I can live without some information being filled in about Bourne's
past.<br><br>To those who have moaned about the incompatibility of the book and the
movie, seek help. There are probably several things that work in the book
that would either be boring and take too much screen time to explain, or
would be viewed as cliche to modern screen audiences. As I remember, I
liked
the book, and I definitely like this movie. I view any movie adaptation as
an interpretation of the book rather than a translation from words to
pictures anyway.<br><br>As for realism, most of the action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets
are to be seen, no incredibly lovely models fall madly in bed with Bourne,
and the hero shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very
high level of training and competance. As someone who has trained in
martial
arts for over 10 years, unrealistic fight scenes are a pet peeve. The
fights
in ""Bourne"" are fast, nasty, and very realistic while still being
entertaining for the layman. (And yes, taking a gun away from some idiot
who
is standing well within your striking radius without getting shot is
definitely doable, though I had serious doubts until we tested it for
ourselves with plastic dart guns in the dojo several years
ago).<br><br>While not being perfect, ""The Bourne Identity"" is, simply put, several
grades above the typical spy film. Being focused on an individual level
rather than involving itself huge political ramifications lends it another
layer of respectability rather than detracting from it as some comments
have
implied since it remains a human problem on a comprehensible scale. The
mysteries that are left are bigger mysteries for Bourne than us, and I
think
should be viewed as intentional omissions rather than loose ends. The
implausibilities are kept to a minimum and the realism to as high a level
as
possible while still being spectacular enough to meet the expectations of
the genre.

James Bond and Ethan Hunt take notice. ""The Bourne Identity"" is my new
standard for contemporary spy thrillers.  Gone (or almost gone) are the
special effects that James and Ethan rely on all too heavily. Hell, in those
franchises the special effects have virtually replaced story and characters.
""The Bourne Identity"" has a very straightforward story to tell, a mystery
that slowly unravels. Spycraft is not all about technical gizmos, but
requires human brains and human brawn (and a fair amount of gunplay and car
chases). <br><br>Set in various locales in Switzerland and France during the winter much of
the visuals for ""The Bourne Identity"" are gray and damp. That's a plus,
Monte Carlo and like locales can get boring. Mat Damon is great as Jason
Bourne, fished from the Mediterranean mostly dead by gunshot wounds. A total
amnesiac, he slowly realizes that he possesses the deadly skills of a
well-trained assassin, and that someone is out to kill him. Franka Potente
is equally good as the young woman swept up in his life and forced to run
with him. Run or be killed.<br><br>I can't say enough good things about this movie. Doug Limon, thanks, you did
a great job.

Next to Ronin, this is one of the best action / spy movies that I've
ever seen. I heard a lot of good critics, but didn't know what to think
about it. I only saw it 2 years after it first appeared and I'm a
little disappointed that I didn't go watch it in the cinema.<br><br>I'm not too keen on movies like James Bond and other stuff in this
genre, but this one is a lot better. Normally you see the ""super hero""
using all kinds of weird gadgets, driving extremely fast sports cars
and sleeping with ladies who look more like prostitutes than being
normal women.<br><br>Jason Bourne however doesn't have all this things, which makes this
movie a lot more realistic. The fights are fast and very realistic but
still entertaining. The action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets,
no incredibly willing women sharing his bed... Our hero even shows
definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of
training and competence. In the meanwhile he has to deal with amnesia,
while being hunted without knowing why. In the end this is still a man
which you can identify yourself with.<br><br>I would say: Go watch it when you are a fan of movies like Ronin, don't
watch it if you think James Bond is a person who you can bump into on
the streets when going out. Personally I would award this movie with an
8/10.

This is a great movie. Unfortunately one reviewer has no knowledge
towards the field of psychology. One reviewer states it's a good movie
based on a completely false occurrence, that being amnesia in general.
They say it doesn't exist and nobody loses their memory of their
identity while retaining knowledge of everything else. This is untrue.
I am currently studying to become a psychologist, it's called
Dissociative Amnesia. -Dissociative Amnesia - formerly Psychogenic
Amnesia, is a pervasive loss of memory of significant personal
information. This disorder is characterized by a blocking out of
critical personal information. Dissociative amnesia, unlike other types
of amnesia, does not result from other medical trauma, such as a blow
to the head. The predominant disturbance is one or more episodes of
inability to recall important personal information, usually of a
traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by
ordinary forgetfulness - Just to prove, it's true, and does happen. So
this movie is not based on something made up, similar losses of memory
do happen to people. Especially people in a job such as that. So,
concluding, this is a great action film, I truly enjoyed this movie
along with the sequel, The Bourne Supremacy. Both are I think going to
be a couple of the best movies we will see this decade (2000-2010)

This story has been done several times in the past, most recently in ""A
Long Kiss Goodnight"". It's also true that Doug Liman and the producers
created their own Jason Bourne mythology,since this movie is different
in many ways to the book. But the truth is Liman takes an old story and
puts a new fast paced spin on it.<br><br>Matt Damon stars as the enigmatic assassin who just wants to figure out
who he is. As he travels from city to city he's followed by CIA agents
who want to dispose of him to save their own jobs. He's helped along
the way by Marie played by the brilliant Franka Potente. Together they
come face to face with the people that want them dead.<br><br>The cast is great and so is the story. This film should be on
everyone's top ten list.

Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is a highly trained assassin, found left for
dead at sea. He wakes to find he has no memory of who he is and he
needs answers fast if he is to survive the attempts to erase his
existence.<br><br>The Bourne Identity is excellently paced and brings a great deal of
realism to the spy genre. The fight sequences are fast and believable,
the car chases are accurately choreographed and the character of Jason
Bourne is vulnerable and easy to identify with.<br><br>Matt Damon plays the role with apparent ease, he simply slips into the
character and brings him to life. As spy thrillers go The Bourne
identity one of the best around.<br><br>8/10

The crew of a fishing vessel find a body floating in the middle of the
ocean. They bring it on board and the improvised 'doctor' finds two
bullets on the back and a Swiss bank account implanted in the hip of
the body. The 'body' indeed is not dead but unconscious: he is Jason
Bourne (Matt Dammon), a CIA secret and very well prepared agent with
amnesia. During the period of fishing in the sea, he recovers his
health. Once on shore, he decides to go to the Swiss bank and then to

I was really nervous, though. I hadn\'t kissed many girls in real life."" - about his scene with Claire Danes in the film To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday (1996).      It only takes 30 seconds to pluck my eyebrows, but it hurts. I have to tweeze them in the middle once a week. Otherwise, I look like Bert from Sesame Street (1969). I\'ve been doing it for 11 years.      [on his career choice] [Acting is] the only thing I\'m good at. I know how to create and make people feel something. Honestly, if I didn\'t do this, I would just have some minimum-wage job in New Mexico, and I would go out on the weekends and make just enough money to pay my insurance and pay for a couple beers, and that would be it.      [on Valentine\'s Day] I think it\'s kind of a crock, and here\'s why: I believe we should be doing that every day [...] make your girl feel special whenever you can. I\'m a big big believer in surprises. You\'ve got to be romantic all of the time. Guys, you can hate me or whatever for saying this, but you know what you should do.      (On children) ""I will be the best father you\'ve ever seen. I will win father of the year everytime. And Sarah will be the most fantastic mother.""      I\'m going to stop acting in the next few years because it\'s just too weird. You have to constantly be willing to live in a scary, emotional place, which is why actors are in therapy all the time.      If people would only think of (my father\'s) gift (of comedy) instead of his death, I would love it. I have an album of his stand-up, ""Lookin\' Good"", and no matter how upset I was, anytime, ever, the second I played it he could make me laugh. He was so sharp and spontaneous, so fast!      Life is not about making dough or how many movies you can make in a year. It\'s about finding someone that you can share things with.      I know one day I\'m going to be the best father in the world. Me not having a father makes me want to be a great one. I have so much love I wanted to give him, and I\'ll be damned if I don\'t give it to a child of mine.      Drugs are the sucker\'s way, man, and I\'m not a sucker. I don\'t smoke, do blow, or hardly ever drink, but there\'s still a fear: what if it\'s genetic? I want to be like Evander Holyfield, who has a work ethic, morals, a real heart, who understands his responsibility to help other people, To me, that\'s an American hero living an American dream.      When I was in school I read a lot of comic books and pretend I was in them and kids would tease me and call me names. But now I do the same things and people say that I\'m artistic and cool and I\'m doing the exact same thing I did in high school. It wasn\'t a very artistic school.      ""My favorite role ever was ""Anthony Pascal"" from The House of Yes (1997). He was like a ""Norman Bates"" before his mom bought the motel years. You knew he was going to snap and something was just a little bit off"".      ""The person who most inspires me today would probably be Evander Holyfield. I like the fact that he\'s very calm and spiritual and knows what he wants. He gives so much back to the community"".      Being a teenager is the roughest (time of your life) and that\'s when your emotions are going 90 mph. I\'d get angry or sad or I isolated myself a little and then I looked for help.      My dad taught me the greatest lesson in life and that\'s to make sure the people around you feel loved. That\'s something he might not have been able to teach me if he were alive. So I owe him one.      After years of feeling like an outsider, I finally have a woman I love, and friends that I can trust. I am the luckiest man in the world to have met Sarah.      I was an untouchable. People just stayed away, which was good because I didn\'t like what they stood for or believed in. I was raised to believe in myself. I know I\'m cool. I\'m not trying to brag or say I\'m the man or anything like that. I don\'t lie or cheat, and I\'m not mean to anybody. I treat people with respect.      I never did drugs in my life, no matter how often it was thrown in my face.      I really tried to live on my own world that no one would want to be a part of. Unfortunately, that backfired, and people wanted to kick the crap out of me because I was different.      To be honest, I wouldn\'t change a thing, cos\' I like me the way I am. That\'s the way I was made and I don\'t think people should try to change that.      My face is all messed up and I\'m covered in scars! Just look at me, I have parts of me that aren\'t perfect at all. I appreciate that people think I\'m this big heart throb film star, but movies are designed to make you look much better than you are in real life.      Y\'know, the way I see it there\'s no such thing as being perfect. We\'re all pretty much made the same but some people are better at certain things than others. Everybody is great at something...you just have to find what that is.      The pole we were using as a light sabre hit the ground before I hit the ground and then it stuck in my chin. When it came out a big old piece of my chin came with it and my mom ran out screaming and she grabbed the piece of my chin and we rushed to the hospital. They put it back in and stitched it in and it looked like I had a beard at five years old with my stitches. - On that scar on his chin.      If you come out here without a solid foundation, you\'re done. You\'re dead before you\'ve lived.      It blows me away to see people younger than my father [was], and for them it\'s becoming fashionable and glamorous to do heroin and put eight pounds of cocaine up your nose a night.      It\'s insane what I see people doing, but they\'re not going to listen to me, so what am I going to do? I\'ve said a couple of things to a couple of people, but they\'re not going to learn anything from me. They\'ve got it made, making $12 million a movie, so they don\'t get it. They don\'t recognize it as a problem, because it helps them forget about their problems. And if anybody who works with them tries to tell them, usually those people get fired.      I was in the Vancouver airport, and I was speaking with a young girl. She asked if I was Freddie Prinze Jr., and I said I was. She kind of giggled, and while I was talking with her, her girlfriend ran up and took my sandwich. I did not call out after her. I didn\'t know what to do. I had never had anyone steal food from me before. How do you react if someone takes your sandwich? I just finished my cup of coffee and got on the plane and flew home. [source: New York Post Online Edition]      [on Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997)] A lot of people owe Sarah a lot for doing that show, and she doesn\'t always get the credit she deserves. She\'s a very strong woman, because she deals with a lot of nonsense, and instead of that nonsense, she should be thanked - and she\'s not. That\'s the reason she won\'t be coming back.      [on a possible Buffy reboot movie] No. Not with Sarah. I\'ve never heard of it coming back whatsoever. Joss Whedon is on the movie train right now, and it hasn\'t stopped yet. So I think he\'ll be on that for a while. They already made one and it didn\'t work. That\'s why they made the TV series. It worked much, much better as a TV series. It worked so well as a TV show, I don\'t think Sarah would want to invest in something that\'s already failed once.      I did 24 (2001), it was terrible. I hated every moment of it. [Kiefer Sutherland] was the most unprofessional dude in the world. That\'s not me talking trash, I\'d say it to his face, I think everyone that\'s worked with him has said that. I just wanted to quit the business after that. So, I just sort of stopped. I went and worked for Vince McMahon at the WWE for Christ\'s sake and it was a crazier job than working with Kiefer, but at least he was cool and tall. I didn\'t have to take my shoes off to do scenes with him, which they made me do. Just put the guy on an apple box or don\'t hire me next time.

I don\'t have a father. I would never give him the credit or acknowledge him as my father.      [on being a teen idol] This is what I\'ve waited for my whole life.      [High school] My biggest complaint is school when it\'s Send-the-roses day. Somebody\'s always left out. I always got roses, but I would give them to someone who hadn\'t gotten any.      [Horror Movies] I\'m always the one who gets killed. And I want it to be really gory. Body parts all over the place. Mangled!      [on Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon]: ""They\'re unbelievable. They\'re an inspiration to young love.""      [on job pressures] There\'s so much pressure on all of us right now. On Katie Holmes, on James Van Der Beek and myself, to do these movies, and do as much as you can because there is the slight feeling that one day your phone will stop ringing. It\'s not about the craft, per se. It\'s so easy to fall for it all because people remind you constantly that as fast as it comes, it can go. And I think there is this sort of paranoia, this need to keep working. And I know that I felt it, and for the first three years of the show, I never had more than a week off, except for Christmas. That was it.      [on being \'skinny\'] How can women be as thin as we are? We have personal trainers to work us out. We have specially prepared meals.      [on the Internet] I got a computer and I\'m learning how to use it. I collect antique books, so I used it to get my copy of \'Les Liaisons Dangereuses,\' and I use it for travel, to look up customs. I went to Fiji, and I looked up all this stuff before I went, like \'Don\'t wear a hat in someone\'s house because it\'s rude, and don\'t wear shoes.\' You\'ve got to think there\'s something better I can do with my time than log on to the Internet and say, \'Ooo, let\'s find out about me!\' I think that would frighten me a little bit.      [on what the word ""feminist"" means] I don\'t call myself a feminist because feminism has a negative connotation. It makes you think of women who don\'t shave their legs. But feminism is not just about not being weak. It\'s about being able to take care of yourself. Just because you might care about what you look like or what the opposite sex thinks of you, it doesn\'t make you not a feminist, although it\'s a word I hate. Do I consider myself a strong female individual? Uh-huh. Can I take care of myself? Yes.      [on her kissing scene with Selma Blair in Cruel Intentions (1999)] It was a great kiss. It even had a saliva trail.      One of the greatest gifts my job has given me is that my mother, who gave up her entire life for me, doesn\'t have to work any more. I\'m now in a position to repay her for her devotion.      I am militant about drugs. You want to do \'em? You\'re out of my life.      [on posing nude] Right now I can\'t picture posing, but I don\'t believe in saying never... There might be a time when I got pregnant and felt really beautiful and wanted to have a nude picture.      [on what she would do if she wasn\'t acting] I would go to college to be a journalist. I always wanted to write for Time or Newsweek.      You\'ll never know what you\'re capable of if you don\'t try.      I don\'t understand why James Bond has to be a man all the time. When Pierce Brosnan retires, why not one of us?      [on why she was happy to get married:] I\'m so grateful I don\'t have to go looking for a man on a Saturday night. I was always terrible at chatting up men. [December 10, 2003]      [about Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997)] To me, the scariest elements of horror films are the things that could really happen. And what is more scary than high school? ... What I like about the show is that it reminds you it\'s O.K. to be different. What people think isn\'t necessarily true. If people walk away with half of that, we\'ve done our job. [New York Times, April 27, 1997]      [on playing Kendall Hart on All My Children (1970)] I seduced my stepfather, and when he wouldn\'t sleep with me, I slept with the stable boy, cried rape, and my mother stabbed him with a letter opener. Then I went to jail for perjury, burned my parents\' divorce papers, and locked up my little sister. I think that was all in the first week. [New York Times, April 27, 1997]      [on attending the Professional Children\'s High School in Manhattan] Everybody there had a talent, and everyone was respected. If somebody didn\'t like you -- they didn\'t talk to you! They didn\'t make fun of you, punish you. You could, you know, mess around with how you dress. You really had that chance to find yourself, and I thank God for that school. I went to that school feeling amazingly untalented. That school was my lifeline. Let me tell you something -- talent night at our school? There was nothing like it.      Horror films are where women can shine and have a chance to lead. They always save the day in these films.      [on gay marriage] I have good friends, gay couples, who\'ve been together for 18 years. It drives me crazy that in the eyes of the law, their love isn\'t acknowledged when I have girlfriends who have married four times by the age of 25.      [on religion] I don\'t believe in organized religion and I never have.      No, that\'s what bothers me. That\'s how they think. Okay, this is a summer...I remember that it used to be you could see great movies any time. Now it\'s like summer is for blockbusters, fall is for the movies that they can\'t fit into any other time, that\'s like September. Then Oscar movies start, it used to be post Thanksgiving. Now the awards are earlier so it starts earlier. January is when they dump movies. And it\'s just so... it seems to me so obvious that wouldn\'t it be better for the marketplace to have these movies spread out? Not just people don\'t only go to the movies in summer time. If that was the truth, then in the summer time they would count the whole week\'s worth of the box office but it\'s still only a weekend. So why does it matter...sorry, I get a little upset. It\'s just frustrating.      Basically I only like to choose films that I don\'t understand. As long as they\'re greater than my mental capacity, I figure I gotta be doing something artful, right? Isn\'t that what makes something art when you don\'t understand it?      I wish, and I wish so much for the film industry right now. I wish so much for originality and I wish so much and I think that we\'re caught in this difficult cycle right now because our studios are corporations now. I keep talking about the old 1940s, where one guy with a cigar and a scotch made decisions for a studio and now, because there are all these computer corporations basically, technology companies and there\'s so much else that goes into a decision that it\'s very difficult to get films that are different, that are off the beaten path, made. It\'s much easier to get something unoriginal made than to get something original.      ""Simply Irresistible (1999) was just a bad choice - and for that it was a great learning experience. I wasn\'t ready to make that movie. I was too young. The script was not ready. I knew in my heart before I left to make it that I should back out"".      [on how she would like Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997) and her work on it to be remembered] I hope positively. One thing about the show was it was never categorized. It was drama, comedy, action, horror, all of those things combined. And I just want people to remember it as a fabulous run, a fabulous seven years.      In this day and age, everything is so cross-marketed that the lines have blurred, in my opinion, between what is an actor and what is a celebrity. What is reality? All you have to do is pick up a magazine or turn on the television and you can get ideas from places that five years ago you couldn\'t.      [Working in LA filming Southland Tales (2006)] That\'s so weird. It\'s one of those things that\'s like you go on location and you\'re there for a week getting ready. Here it\'s like you\'re walking the dog, you\'re paying the bills and then 10 minutes later, you have to go to work. It\'s a very sort of odd- - I\'m grateful for it and so glad to actually film a movie in Hollywood. Although some of these locations are pretty far. I could probably fly to some of them.      [on her doing movies and Freddie Prinze Jr. doing his show] It\'s funny in the sense of he\'ll say to me, \'You don\'t understand. You\'re doing a movie. I\'ve been on my feet all day.\' I\'m like, \'For real? For real I don\'t understand?\' So that\'s kind of odd. And the times are funny because I\'m on nights and he\'s more organized in terms of...or last week he was getting out of the house at like 3:30 in the morning.      [Her advice for her husband, Freddie Prinze Jr. on his sitcom Freddie (2005)] Do a sitcom. Don\'t do a one hour. That was actually my advice. He was going to do a one hour. I was like, \'Are you crazy? You know what people make for sitcoms and how little they work, right? You see all of our friends on sitcoms.      You know what? I only see myself doing films that interest me and that are a little bit off the beaten path. I will go wherever that takes me. I just - - I always say it just can\'t be generic. I can\'t be the girlfriend or the wife or the - - you can\'t play the characters that I\'ve been blessed to play and then do that. I can\'t be the girl in the film.      I think the best piece of advice I\'ve ever gotten is to trust myself and go for my dreams. I got that from my mom.      Being sexy is being confident. It\'s important to know you don\'t have to have silicone breasts falling out and a thigh-high skirt. Sometimes you meet people and they think, \'Another cute little blonde actress.\' That\'s not who I am. - on rather being known as clever than sexy.      [on not wanting children at this point] You can\'t be selfish and have a child. Right now I want to live my life and have fun. I want to go sit in my Jacuzzi and drink wine all night. [December 2007]      I had to twist his [Freddie\'s] arm and leg to see Moulin Rouge! (2001) Although he enjoyed it once we were there. In fact, there was a moment during the evening when I swear I thought he was going to leave me for Nicole Kidman but then, who could blame him? I\'d probably leave him for Nicole if she asked. She\'s hot!      It sounds clichéd, but when women turn 30 they find themselves. You become more comfortable in your own skin. Last night on Letterman I wore this skintight Herve Ledger dress. Two years ago, three years ago? I would never have worn it. - Gothman Magazine.      [on her character Buffy Summers] For eight years I had the pleasure of portraying a character that was the very definition of a powerful woman. In my opinion, one of the greatest examples in the history of entertainment. [2007]      As an actor, you constantly play these other characters. You\'re always pretending to be somebody else, but at the same time you have to keep a handle on who you are. I think that\'s where a lot of actresses get lost sometimes, because that\'s tough. I can only imagine it has to be the same as a pop star because you\'re not even playing a character. You\'re a persona.      [After having her baby girl Charlotte] I\'m not going back to work anytime soon. I\'ll only have my first child once and see these milestones once. I can\'t imagine not being there. We\'re (she and husband Freddie Prinze Jr.) just taking it one day at a time. I\'m such a cliché right now, but she is the greatest gift that anyone has ever given me, and I will spend the rest of my life doing everything I can to do right by her. What still overwhelms me is the reality that we created this life together, and now we are responsible for her. She is here; she is ours. I\'d say that makes us pretty lucky, indeed. [November 2009]      [on the suggestion of a \'Buffy\' film, 2004] \'My concern with a film is, how can we do it justice? We went out on top, and I like staying there. That doesn\'t mean I won\'t change my mind. I\'m a woman. It\'s my prerogative to change my mind as often as I like!\'      [on working with Seth Green] \'If I had my way, I\'d work with Seth on every project. I think the world of him...he\'s an amazingly gifted comedian and he\'s also a very giving comedian.\'      [on a possible Buffy reboot movie] It was a movie! It\'s been made. It stars Kristy Swanson, they made it! They don\'t need to make another one. I think it\'s a horrible idea to try to do a Buffy without Joss Whedon, I mean that\'s like honestly...to be incredibly non-eloquent, that\'s the dumbest idea I ever heard.      [on the importance of reading] I love books. I\'m constantly afraid we\'re moving into this digital era where books are going to go away, and to me books are the basis to everything in life. Reading is how we function. It\'s not just creative imagination and creative play, it\'s how we function as human beings, as human adults, and if you can instill that at a young age then that\'s a skill they\'ll have for life.      [looking back on Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997)] I think it\'s gotten me to this point now where I don\'t have this burning desire to accomplish anything. That was so fulfilling for me in every way that everything I do now is the cherry on top. I don\'t feel the pressure to do this or have to do this or go here or do that because I feel like I\'ve already won.      [on enjoying working, but not letting it take over her life] I was 18 years old when I started ""Buffy,"" and work was my everything. Back then, no actor had worse hours than I did. Now I don\'t work on weekends anymore. Everybody knows you can\'t sway me on that point, so nobody even tries. Plus, my perspective on work has changed: Work doesn\'t define who I am. I love what I do, but I don\'t feel a burning pressure anymore. And because I\'m working for fun, I get to enjoy it. I\'d watch Ringer (2011) if I wasn\'t on it! Of course, it\'s not as much fun when you know what\'s going to happen. It takes some of the excitement away.      [on how having a child has changed her perspective on work] I would never fault anyone\'s decisions and choices, but being a parent was so important to me. I just couldn\'t be the parent who goes from country to country and leaves their child, or schleps their child with them.      [on finding it difficult to understand people who view returning to TV after strictly working in film is a step down career-wise] I don\'t feel like I didn\'t succeed - The Grudge (2004) is still the second-highest female opening ever. And Ringer (2011) doesn\'t feel like a retrograde step, not to me. That is the weird perception, but I think it\'s slowly changing.      [on whether or not she is fed up with looking back and talking about Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997)] Fed up with it? No! No, no, no! I\'m so proud of it, and I actually like talking about it more now than I did then. Because I was 19, 20. Sometimes I think, to get true perspective, you have to step away, to realize the impact that something had.      [on how Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997) affected the course of television] ""Buffy"" came at the right time ... Now you see these great roles on television all the time. Glenn Close in Damages (2007)? One of the greatest actresses of all time. Sally Field in Brothers & Sisters (2006)? TV is where the roles are. Without wishing to sound obnoxious, I do think it changed the course of television. It certainly changed genre television. It just came at the right time for that.      I clip coupons all the time. Why should you pay more for something that someone else is paying less for?      Relationships are like flowers: They need attention to grow and develop. You have to make time to be there for the other person.      I kiss other girls, sure, but that doesn\'t make me a lesbian. Does it? I mean, I read \'\'Playgirl\'\'.      [on quitting Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997)] You always worry about being the show that\'s been on too long especially when you\'re a cult hit. Last year, a lot of people were ready to tear us down. So when we started to have such a strong year this year, I thought, \'\'This is how I want to go out on top, at our best.\'\' I was 18 when I started the show; I\'m 26. I\'m married. I never see my husband. This has been the longest span of my life in one place. There\'ve been times where that\'s been difficult, you want to pick up and go, try other things, live in different places. It feels right, and you have to listen to that. The show, as we know it, is over. I love this job, I love the fans. I love telling the stories we tell. This isn\'t about leaving for a career in movies, or in theater, it\'s more of a personal decision. I need a rest. Teachers get sabbaticals. Actors don\'t.      [on The Crazy Ones (2013)] James Wolk is a star. Like I said to Robin, \'Its great that you\'re Robin Williams and you\'re great and you\'re funny, but Jimmy Wolk is stealing this entire show from you. Like, watch out      [on being called Buffy] Back then, if you\'d called me Buffy I would probably have been really annoyed. Now, of course, I get it and I\'m appreciative of it. But that\'s something that comes with maturity, which most people don\'t have when they\'re 24 years old.      I\'ve definitely smoked cigarettes, and I\'ve partied plenty. I just got it out of my system early. I was lucky enough to have had my experiences when I was younger - and out of the public eye. When I was younger, I was very careful not to... I just didn\'t want to be seen with a drink in my hand. People looked up to Buffy, and she was a character that girls respected.      [on motherhood] For me, having a child was that cliched, life-altering experience where everything took on a different meaning. Things that had once been priorities had no meaning to me anymore, and things that I\'d never thought about suddenly became things that were on my mind. If I\'d known how happy having a child would make me, I probably would have had one a long time ago.      I got locked out of our new house a few days ago without any shoes on and ended up bloodying and scraping the bottom of my feet. I kind of scaled a wall thinking I was still a 22-year-old superhero.      [on her character in Star Wars: Rebels (2014)] I may be number seven, but I\'m pretty much number one.Salary (6)Buffy the Vampire Slayer\xa0(1997)      $75,000 per episode (Seasons 1-5), $100,000 - $150,000 per episode (Season 6), $350,000 per episode (Season 7)      Cruel Intentions\xa0(1999)      $500,000       Scooby-Doo\xa0(2002)      $1,500,000       Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed\xa0(2004)      $4,500,000       The Grudge\xa0(2004)      $600,000       Ringer\xa0(2011)      $90,000 per episode          if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nMatthew Lillard ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 48 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(2)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(13)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(28)  Overview (3)Date of Birth24\xa0January1970,\xa0Lansing, Michigan, USA Birth NameMatthew Lyn LillardHeight6\'\xa04""\xa0(1.93\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Matthew Lillard was born in Lansing, Michigan, to Paula and Jeffrey Lillard.

I\'m a trained actor! I\'ve done Shakespeare and here I am having farting contests with an imaginary dog!      [on directing versus acting and directing his first film] - I think that that\'s [directing] a way more exciting way to live your life... Being an actor, you have to memorize a page of dialogue, and you hit a mark and you say the line with honesty and energy and hopefully it works. Being a director is so much more fulfilling. You just have so much more input, you have more avenues to tell a story, and the experience overall to me was such a life-changing event. If it was up to me, I would never act again and direct for the rest of my life to be honest.      [2012, on SLC Punk! (1998)] It\'s the only time in my life that I\'ve ever been given the opportunity to really carry a film. I mean, you could argue I carried Scooby-Doo (2002) to some extent, too, but... Oh, I guess I\'ve done it on other movies, too, like _Spooner_. But for me, the proudest piece of acting I have is when I\'m doing what I do in most of that film. I mean, that\'s one of those movies that I remember doing and being super-proud of it even as I was doing it. You mention that movie, and ""pride"" is definitely the first word that comes to mind.      [2012, on filming Wing Commander (1999)] We shot that in Luxembourg, and all I remember is that my hair was so bleached and short that I had open wounds on my scalp. Oh, the price you pay for fame.      [2012, on Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go to College (1991)] I was a non-union extra for 19 days. And on the last day, I told them they were going to give me my Screen Actors Guild card or they were going to have to reshoot the scene without me, but I was going to get it. And the first assistant director told me I was never going to work again. But look at me now!      [2012, on making Thir13en Ghosts (2001)] The only time in my life a director\'s said to me, ""Do it again, but do it better."" Look, I loved the movie. Tony Shalhoub is one of the great actors of our generation. All I really remember about Thir13en Ghosts (2001), though, is that it was really hot and filled with people who were doused in blood. \'Cause there\'s nothing that conducts heat like glass and movie lights. It\'s a terrible combination. It was glass, movie lights, and the smell of burning latex, \'cause all the rubber on the people-all the ghosts were covered in latex, and the whole thing just stunk to high hell. Also, I\'ll never forget F. Murray Abraham at 4 o\'clock in the morning, in a junkyard in the middle of winter in Vancouver, British Columbia, standing on top of 16 stacked cars with a fan blowing directly in his face, screaming down, ""This movie isn\'t about special effects, it\'s about acting!"" I was, like, ""I think you\'re wrong, bro."" I mean, he was screaming it in this really snide, pompous voice, ""It isn\'t about special effects, it\'s about acting!"" Eh, maybe not.      [2012, on Hackers (1995)] One of my favourite jobs ever. I\'m one of the few people in the world who can say they knew Angelina Jolie before she had tattoos. It was her first movie, and... You know how some people are meant for greatness and some people are meant to be fourth on the call sheet? It was obvious on that movie which of us was which... I think that\'s the most amazing thing about that movie: It\'s perceived as cooler now than it ever was when it originally came out.      [2012, on Nash Bridges (1996)] I\'ll never forget Don Johnson looking at me and saying, ""You know what? I used to be good, too, until I started doing this shit."" And I thought to myself, ""Oh, my God, what have I gotten myself into? You call this a career...? I\'m going to be miserable.""      [2012, on Scream (1996)] Yeah, you know, that was one of the greatest experiences of my life, and it ended up being one of the biggest hits of my life, so it\'s nice when that culmination hits on both sides. And with that said, I really wish the world would ask me about things other than Stuart in Scream (1996). For every three Twitter followers I have, one of them asks me three times a day, ""What was it like to play Stuart in Scream (1996)?"" Dude, that\'s like asking a 6-year-old, ""What was it like going potty for the first time by yourself?"" You know the impact it had, but you don\'t really dwell on it.      [2012, on landing The Descendants (2011)] No one has ever called me up (with an offer) for a film in the entire history of mankind. The only time I ever get called up is to validate whether I\'m dead or not. Look, my career has never been about somebody needing me. It\'s always me needing them much more. So, yeah, I auditioned, and trust me when I say that I thought I was the last guy to ever get the role of the guy who gets George Clooney\'s wife. I almost went in as a dare more than anything else, because you\'re definitely kind of transcending reality at that point.      [on Casey Kasem] Casey is a legend. There\'s something dignified and noble and wonderful about him. I grew up listening to him - he was the original Shaggy. He\'s a dear, dear man.      Charlie Brown\'s good. I always had a little crush on that Lucy. I thought she was kind of a hot little brunette.      I direct with energy. I believe in energy. I think energy is an electric thing in actors. I try to inspire, encourage, and make choices with lots of energy. And truth. I\'m big fan of truth and being funny. I like leading 50 people into battle every day.      Now, more then ever, we have the ability to make films for almost nothing and that\'s broken down all barriers of entry. I think it\'s a new golden age of film-making. With that, there needs to be the ability to recoup investment dollars, people need to make money.      Something like Without a Paddle (2004) does really well at the box office and I\'m like, \'Oh, here we go.\' In Without a Paddle (2004) I\'m the romantic lead - great! A comedy and that\'s what America wants. Then it did nothing for me and I went into kind-of a work abyss. I just didn\'t get another shot.      When you\'re making an independent film what you don\'t have in time and money you have to make up with creativity and diligence.      Being onstage is like being rock star. Whereas if you\'re doing a movie, it\'s such a confined space. You know, you do a comedy, it\'s so hard, too, \'cause with a comedy, there\'s no vocal reaction, there\'s no energy that you get back that spurs you on to be funnier because everyone has to be quiet.      There are several times when I walked into a room and just felt like such a sham. That\'s the problem with auditioning.      I got into a bad jag of movies that helped pay the rent and I thought would help further me along.      Character actors are becoming a thing of the past. They\'re just going by the wayside. They\'re just cutting through that caliber of acting.      Hollywood used to be run by artists and people who loved artists... people who wanted to make movies for all the right reasons. For the love. The Art. To tell stories. Yes to make money as well, but it was about both. Now I feel, it\'s mostly about bottom line and making money.      I always think that I\'m the best thing in a lot of bad movies. Personally, I have to. I think that I like me as an actor.      You just realize that at the beginning of Scooby you\'re just going to start at level ten and stay at ten the entire time. It\'s hard. It physically beats you up. It\'s definitely one of the hardest movies you can do.      How much do you have to pay someone to be in a George Clooney/ Alexander Payne film? Nothing! Because everyone in the world wants to be a part of it. Therefore you pay nothing. And that continues until you become something they need... I\'m not that kind of actor. I\'m blue collar and very replaceable.      I like doing family films.      So much of Hollywood is about who the people you work with are.      I think one of the main reason\'s Rick Rosenthal and Whitewater Pictures decided to \'get in bed with me\' on Fat Kid was because I came in with a strong business plan as well as a creative vision on how to make the film.      Somehow, someway, you get kind of labeled this guy who was in a Freddie Prinze Jr.. movie too many. And Freddie Prinze Jr.. - it\'s not his fault, either - it\'s just these are the things that happen. I\'m not a George Clooney; I don\'t have a ton of opportunities.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nLinda Cardellini ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 40 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(14)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(22)  Overview (3)Date of Birth25\xa0June1975,\xa0Redwood City, California, USA Birth NameLinda Edna CardelliniHeight5\'\xa03""\xa0(1.6\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Linda Edna Cardellini was born in Redwood City, California, to Lorraine (Hernan) and Wayne David Cardellini, a businessman.

In the same year, Cardellini delivered a heartfelt performance as a jilted lover in Ang Lee\'s highly-acclaimed drama, Brokeback Mountain (2005), which garnered major accolades from critics, including an Academy Award nomination and Golden Globe win for Best Picture and Outstanding Ensemble in a Motion Picture Drama by the Screen Actor\'s Guild.It was upon working with Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana on this film, that they later cast her in CBS\'s Hallmark Hall of Fame mini-series Comanche Moon (2008), a testament to their trust in Cardellini\'s talent and presence on screen. Cardellini starred alongside Val Kilmer and Steve Zahn in the six-hour, epic mini-series in 2008, written by McMurtry (based on McMurtry\'s novel of the same name), directed by Simon Wincer and executive-produced by Ossana. This western, which was the prequel to ""Lonesome Dove,"" (the television series created in 1989 by McMurtry) aired on three consecutive evenings for two hours each night.In 2008, Cardellini portrayed the lead role of \'Julie Ingram\' in the feature film ""The Lazarus Project"" starring alongside \'Paul Walker\'. Directed by John Glenn, this thriller tells the story of a former criminal who is drawn into an illicit endeavor and subsequently finds himself living an inexplicable new life working at a psychiatric facility.In 2011, Cardellini co-starred in Jonathan Hensleigh\'s independent feature film ""Kill the Irishman,"" alongside Christopher Walken, Ray Stevenson and Val Kilmer. The film was based on the true story of Danny Greene, a tough Irish thug working for mobsters in Cleveland during the 1970s. In February 2012, Cardellini starred as \'Kelli\' in the independent film ""Return,"" opposite Michael Shannon and John Slattery which earned Cardellini an Independent Spirit Award nomination for ""Best Female Lead."" ""Return"" was featured in the Director\'s Fortnight section at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and was an official entry at The Deauville, London and Palm Springs International Film Festivals. ""Return"" follows \'Kelli\' as she returns home from war and learns how to adjust to a slower, normal life.In 2013, Cardellini was almost unrecognizable, but turned heads, for her provocative portrayal of \'Sylvia Rosen,\' \'Don Draper\'s\' married mistress, in a guest arc in the sixth season of the critically acclaimed AMC series, ""Mad Men."" She received her first Emmy nomination for ""Outstanding Guest Actress in A Drama Series"" for her portrayal.Working in both film and television, Linda is well-known for her portrayal of \'Nurse Samantha Taggart\' on NBC\'s highly-rated, critically acclaimed series, ""ER"". She will next be seen as \'Meg Rayburn\' in Netflix\'s new untitled family drama series created by Glenn Kessler, Daniel Zelman and Todd Kessler. Cardellini also has a co-starring role in the indie comedy Welcome to Me (2014), opposite an all-star cast that includes Kristen Wiig, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack, James Marsden and Wes Bentley. The film is directed by Shira Piven. ""Welcome to Me"" was produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay and premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival.On the small screen, Cardellini was a guest star, playing \'Dr. Megan Tillman\', in CBS\' Person of Interest (2011). The crime drama show was created by Jonathan Nolan and stars Jim Caviezel, Taraji P. Henson and Michael Emerson. Cardellini also lends her voice to a diverse group of animated series including Nickelodeon\'s ""Sanjay & Craig"" wherein she plays \'Megan,\' IFC\'s ""Out There"" wherein she voices \'Starla,\' and Disney\'s ""Gravity Falls,"" in which she is \'Wendy.\' Cardellini\'s past voiceover work includes the role of \'Bliss,\' the family daughter in the ABC animated television program, The Goode Family (2009).Linda has a Bachelor of Arts degree in Theatre from Loyola Marymount University, and completed a summer study program at the National Theatre in London.

My daughter and I are lucky to be alive.      I just got back from Switzerland, which I\'ve never been to. I went to Switzerland and Amsterdam.      After I finished ER (1994), I wanted to concentrate on re-examining what kind of actress I am and taking time for real-life things.      Being raised Catholic myself, I think people who are Catholic tend to carry a lot of guilt. It\'s almost a joke.      I love to work on a set whether it\'s mostly men or mostly women, but there\'s something about being in a community of women that changes the energy.      I think everyone feels lost at times during their high school years.      I think in real life most of us don\'t know how to communicate our deepest feelings very well.      I think I\'m going to spend some time learning how to be a first-time mom, and then I\'ll go back to work.      The one thing about being on ER (1994) that has changed is that I\'m more easily recognizable.      Yes, I\'m very close to my family. And being that close to your family, I think you also struggle with how to become your own person.      People who have no idea it\'s me when they first see me playing something, and later they realize, \'That\'s her from whatever it is,\' it\'s a great compliment that they can forget.      I always thought I was a little shy, especially compared to my brother and my sister, but I guess I was always the kid doing performances in the front room.      One thing I like about trying to write is that I can possibly write myself a role. Otherwise, you\'re at the mercy of whatever roles are out there that people are willing to give to you.      There are not that many jobs as an actor where you don\'t get to know what your character will be doing from episode to episode.      I have sort of the career where, if you are a fan, you\'ve been following me for a while, and you really like something that I\'ve done, so meeting those people is always a really gracious experience.      I like diversity; I want one character to be very different from the next. I love to live with a character for a long time if I can, but I like one character to be different from the next.      One of my favorite things to do is not to speak on screen. In theater it\'s different because there\'s a lot of emphasis on language - it\'s a different medium. But that is one of the most wonderful things about film. A person\'s face can say so much more than their voice can.      I remember when I took the role on ER (1994), I thought, ""I haven\'t really been able to play a working class woman. I\'ve played girls, I\'ve played funny, but I haven\'t played a working class woman. That sounds like something I\'d like to do"".      I was extremely close with my parents. Breaking away from that is a double-edged sword: It\'s something you need to do, but it\'s hard to cut the apron strings.      When I was a kid, Scooby Doo, Where Are You! (1969) was, hands down, my favorite cartoon. Even when I was older, when I was in college studying and I needed to tune out for a while, I\'d watch ""Scooby Doo"".      You know, the hard thing about audiences not liking what a character does is that they sometimes take it out on the actor personally. That\'s something that you know when you become an actor or actress, but it\'s always hard to deal with when it actually happens.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['Fred Jones', '""Fred is the handsome, blond member of a teenage gang that solves mysteries with a cowardly Great Dane in the TV cartoon series ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You!""

When I first heard about Scooby Doo being turned into a movie, I will
confess to being rather reticent about seeing it. I am just old enough to
remember the original Scooby Doo cartoons on rerun, and was at the high
end
of the right target age group when Scrappy Doo hit the scene, and of
course
remembered Scooby Doo with a certain love. Of course, the cartoon was
actually pretty terrible; the writing was bad, the cliches came in at a
rate
of knots, and the animation was second rate... but that's what we all
expected of Hanna-Barbara cartoons.<br><br>I digress: I had heard about SD the movie on the Internet quite early in
production and let out a groan; my childhood was being raped again for a
buck in Hollywood. Why? Why bother??? Then when I heard Scooby was going
to
be CGI I actually groaned again. Of course, there is no other way you
could
have pulled Scoob off on-screen without CGI, at least not
realistically...
but CGI... that's just so passe any more! I still enjoy the artistry in
modern CGI, but to me it felt like SD was going to be done just to prove
that it COULD be done with modern technology... not to tell a
story.<br><br>So it came, I read a few online reviews that panned it and failed to be
surprised. I caught the trailers and failed to be inspired. I steadfastly
avoided the movie theatres and just didn't go see it.<br><br>Fast forward to July of 2003; SD is playing on Cinemax (I think) and I've
got some time to kill. Aw, what the hell... could be good for background
noise if nothing else...<br><br>So having sat through SD the Movie, what do I think? Well, as much as I
wanted to hate it because it was Hollywood raping my childhood, I just
couldn't. I'm not going to say I loved it because that wouldn't be true,
but
I'll be darned if I can't admit that it was a whole hell of a lot better
than I expected. Let me fill you in;<br><br>The cast is incredible. They have a real on-screen chemistry that really
makes the movie for me. Especially Matthew Lillard as Shaggy... if he
hasn't
just completely NAILED the character as perfectly as you could in live
action, then I'm the queen of France. There's the romantic attraction
between Daphne and Fred that comes out on-screen pretty much throughout,
and
of course the distant attraction Velma had for Fred is right there too.
But
do I detect a little bit of an attraction to Shaggy? Don't remember that
in
the cartoon... but I can accept that.<br><br>The story? Well, it's a hell of a lot better written than the cartoons!
Yes,
it borrows heavily from them (and borrows from some of the SD animated
movies that have been made in the interim), but still it's an interesting
story with a nice twist at the end that had me actually laughing out
loud.
Not Shakespeare by any stretch of the imagination... but a fun and
engaging
story that keeps your attention.<br><br>So what about the CGI Scoob? Wow is all I can say! I don't know what
makes
it more, the quality of the CGI or the way in which all the actors really
made me believe they were sharing the screen with a 6'5"" intelligent dog.
The interactions were believable, and not once did I catch anyone making
the
mistake of looking in the wrong place on-screen (which is clearly evident
in
many instances where CGI characters are used). The personality is
captured
perfectly and translates Scooby from the two-color animation of my youth
to
a perfect rendition of how I envisaged him in my minds eye.<br><br>I'm sure many have heard about them already, but there are plenty of
in-jokes that pepper the movie for those willing to pay attention. I
won't
say they're all laugh-out-loud funny, but they are amusing... and it was
obvious pretty early on that the film-makers didn't like Scrappy Doo
either
(I know I didn't... I didn't even like him as a kid), but rather than
pretend he never happened (*cough* Galactica 1980 *cough*) they actually
bring him to life in this movie too... and actually he has one of the
lines
that made me laugh out loud (to those who have seen it, it's the line he
never finishes saying...)<br><br>So did I love it as much as I loved Scooby as a kid? No. The movie was
definitely not without flaws, and it did depart from the cartoons in some
pretty major ways; for example one of the nice things about the cartoon
(looking at it now from an adult's perspective) was that at the end of
every
episode it was reiterated however lightly that there are no such things
as
monsters, ghosts, ghouls etc. and that we as people are always
responsible
for these things. This is something I picked up on as a kid but didn't
understand until I was an adult; and kids should be given that
reassurance
early in life that there are no monsters. The movie departed from that
part
of the formula... so personally I couldn't recommend the movie to younger
(under about 8 or 9) children. However, even with these kids, recommend
that
a parent watch it with them... but of course there's plenty of adult-type
humor in there too that will completely pass the kids by. To me that's
the
mark of a great kids movie these days; the ability to appeal to all
ages.<br><br>Overall, I'd say a 7 out of 10.

I've always been a big fan of horror films and when I was too young to
watch them, SCOOBY was my favourite cartoon because it had cool heroes and
I
could see all sorts of monsters in it. Even now that I'm an adult, I still
find a lot of pleasure in watching an episode. Just to say that I wasn't
very excited at the perspective of seeing my cult cartoon turned into an
unnamable stuff as the first pictures in the magazines announced a
visually
ridiculous movie with probably (like most of the other TV series
adaptations) a boring and incoherent script.<br><br>When I left the theater, I was in love with this movie. It's a Scooby
fan's
dream come true.The film's never ridiculous: a colourfull and coherent
universe was built around the visual of the cartoon. It's a very rare
thing
but this time, an exact transposition of a cartoon is perfect and doesn't
breed an example in visual bad taste.<br><br>The script intelligently breaks several rules of the cartoon in order to
bring more deepness to the characters. For example, Daphne's tired to be
the
eternal ""stupid"" beauty in danger and Velma can't stand Fred's attitude
anymore as he always acts as if he had solved the mysteries alone. But
these
efforts would have been vain if a ""dream team"" of actors hadn't been
gathered around the hilarious Scooby. Even if the team's composed of five
characters, they're all treated with
the same importance, and that's rare enough to be underscored.<br><br>Matthew LILLARD IS Shaggy: he reproduces perfectly the attitude of the
animated character and his capacity to make you believe in the virtual
Scooby is very impressive: when he's with him, you feel like if the dog
was
really on the set. The duo's perfect.<br><br>Sarah Michelle GELLAR and Freddie PRINZE Jr have a very communicative
energy. It's obvious that they had a very good time playing the two
""beautiful and quite stupid"" characters of the team. Even if
the
role of Daphne was written with ""Buffy"" references, Sarah Michelle GELLAR
succeeds in preserving the essence of the character: I never thought about
Buffy when I saw her as Daphne.<br><br>And the last but not the least, Linda CARDELLINI delivers an outstanding
performance as Velma. She took the animated character and managed to make
her more human, funnier and even touching by bringing all sorts of
irresistible details and mimics as for example in the way she laughs or
says
that she's the most clever of the team. Great job for a great
actress.<br><br>I hope that no sequel will ever reach the screen if any of them is missing
from the cast.<br><br>The story's quite simple but very well paced and entertaining. There are
lots of cool dialogues and ""private jokes"" for the series' fans. All the
gags are in the tone of the cartoon and always effective. I wasn't in
favor
of the use of martial arts through the character of Daphne but finally,
kung
fu fits in the universe of SCOOBY DOO as it's used with parsimony to bring
a
few more good gags.<br><br>As a conclusion, I would say that SCOOBY DOO's a terrific movie: it's fun,
fast and very well acted.I found in it everything that made me love the
cartoon and even more. Don't miss it if you're a SCOOBY
fan: you won't regret it!

I watched Scooby Doo, the cartoon, only with medium level interest as a
child, so I went (with my wife and kids) mostly as a kick.  Matthew Lillard
is brilliant as Shaggy (how is that possible?  His impersonation skills
were
flawless!).  The cartoonimation of Scooby and Scrappy Doo were interesting
but were so 3-D rendered that they did not match the original 2-D versions
very well.  The plot was reasonably interesting and twisted.  No mere
disgruntled janitor in a spooky disguise-- there's some evil genius at
work.
There were some minor plot issues with Velma, Fred, and Daphne having much
greater insecurity issues than in the cartoons, but experimenting with such
ideas is very cartoon-like.  The set and cast worked very well.  There's
some biological humor with Shaggy and Scooby that I did not expect, but the
last bit that they did helped.  If you're prudish about gas-passing and
belching, there are about 4 minutes you can do without, but they seem very
much in character.

This movie works because it tries to mimic the cartoon in many ways. Even
the first shot looks like the first shot of the cartoon with the fog and the
creepy old house. I had originally thought that the CGI Scooby would bother
me during the movie, but I was completely wrong. I only really thought about
that the first time Scooby is shown. After that the dog was Scooby to me
because the things he says and the way he says them are accurate to the
cartoon. The movie is pure cheese, but so was the cartoon. ""Scooby-Doo"" has
maybe the most effective farting scene since ""Blazing Saddles."" Most fart
scenes just come off as gross and not very funny, but in the world of Scooby
a fart scene works. One interesting aspect of the film was seeing Rowan
Atkinson in a role where he actually talks...a lot! I hope he gets more
chances at dialogue-heavy roles here in the States.  Fred, Daphne, Velma and
Shaggy all feel like their cartoon counterparts adding to the effectiveness
of the movie. Lillard is amazing as Shaggy because he gets his voice to
sound like a carbon-copy of the cartoon Shaggy. This is a fun movie to watch
because you can turn your brain off and just enjoy the
show.

This might be a disappointment to die hard Scooby Doo cartoon fans, but I
enjoyed it.  I thought the gags were hilarious, and since I never cared
for
Scrappy Doo, I was especially fond of the end.  I think Matthew Lillard
should get an academy award for the way he interacted to a character that
wasn't even there.  In my mind, every time I see a Scooby Doo cartoon, I
will picture him as Shaggy.  It also brought the characters even more
alive
for me when the ""human"" sides of their personalities came out.  It's
really
reaching to think that a group of people would be able to spend that much
time together and not have individual jealousies and get on each other's
nerves.  I can't wait to see the sequel.

I really think that this movie was pretty good.  Some parts in the movie
were really funny.  This casting was also good, the actors played the
characters pretty well.  I also think it was funny because in cases they
made fun of the cartoon.  Although, I didn't really like the villians.  I
could think of some better villians for the movie, but it just made it more
interesting in the end.  Over all - my rating: 8.

Scooby and the gang investigate a mystery on Spooky Island.<br><br>OK...this is NOT a good movie.  The jokes are very obvious and the PG rating
keeps things very clean and family friendly.  Still, I was laughing a lot. 
Maybe it was my mood, but I kept giggling over all the jokes.  It works
mostly because the entire cast plays it straight.<br><br>Sarah Michelle Gellar looks nothing like Daphne in the cartoon, but she is
good. Likewise, Freddie Prinze Jr. looks nothing like Fred either, but he's
OK.  Matthew Lillard, however, is letter perfect as Shaggy.  Also the woman
playing Velma is right on target.  And the CGI Scooby was just great...his
expressions and body language provided lots of laughs.  Great special effect
and the movie moves quickly.<br><br>My only real complaint--did we really need a burping/breaking wind contest
between Scooby and Shaggy?<br><br>A very good family movie--I liked it a lot. A very guilty favorite all the
way.<br><br>

Scooby-Doo is a worthy live action film to a brilliant original T.V.
show<br><br>Plot: The Mystery Inc. gang have split up and are each off on their
own, only Scooby-Doo (Voice of Neil Fanning) and Shaggy (Matthew
Lilard) remain together and they own the Mystery Machine. They are
called back into action when a strange man shows up and invites them to
Spooky Island to solve a mystery. They are convinced when he mentions
an all you can eat buffet and are on their way to the airport. There
they run into the rest of the gang, Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Velma
(Linda Cardellini), and Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar). Still resenting
each other they refuse contact and once on the island they meet the
owner, Emile Mondavariours (Rowan Atkinson) who informs them of the
problem. He believes that somebody is casting a spell on the visitors
who come to his resort. Starting off on looking for clues by themselves
the gang realizes after a attack that they need to put their
differences aside and team up if they ever want to solve the mystery.<br><br>The Good News: This being the motion picture film to a T.V. series that
spawned thousands of imitators it had a lot to live up to and it
delivers. Since it was released people have bashed this film to pieces,
but if you take a minutes and look at it closely it is a pretty
underrated film. The actors all do an outstanding job at bringing the
gang to life. At first glance Freddie Prinze Jr. may seem like the
wrong choice, but he fills Fred's shoes amazingly well with adequate
skill. Linda Cardellini portrays the brainy smart Velma we all know,
but Linda plays her with a sensitive side which is new and a a nice
choice. Sharah Michelle Gellar is the shining light here bringing
warmth and believability to her character as Daphne, everyones favorite
danger prone female who proves she is tougher than most think in one of

screenplay keeps thing's nice and simple and so is the direction.

Okay, this film is rather sophmoric, but some of the jokes actually were
effective, the special effects were very good (except for scooby-doo
himself, who looked like something made on a home computer), and the
creature designs were very creative.
The cast is also quite good. So, if you can over-look scooby-doo himself,
just appreciate it for what it is: a enjoyable remake of the TV
series.

When I first heard about Scooby Doo being turned into a movie, I will
confess to being rather reticent about seeing it. I am just old enough to
remember the original Scooby Doo cartoons on rerun, and was at the high
end
of the right target age group when Scrappy Doo hit the scene, and of
course
remembered Scooby Doo with a certain love. Of course, the cartoon was
actually pretty terrible; the writing was bad, the cliches came in at a
rate
of knots, and the animation was second rate... but that's what we all
expected of Hanna-Barbara cartoons.<br><br>I digress: I had heard about SD the movie on the Internet quite early in
production and let out a groan; my childhood was being raped again for a
buck in Hollywood. Why? Why bother??? Then when I heard Scooby was going
to
be CGI I actually groaned again. Of course, there is no other way you
could
have pulled Scoob off on-screen without CGI, at least not
realistically...
but CGI... that's just so passe any more! I still enjoy the artistry in
modern CGI, but to me it felt like SD was going to be done just to prove
that it COULD be done with modern technology... not to tell a
story.<br><br>So it came, I read a few online reviews that panned it and failed to be
surprised. I caught the trailers and failed to be inspired. I steadfastly
avoided the movie theatres and just didn't go see it.<br><br>Fast forward to July of 2003; SD is playing on Cinemax (I think) and I've
got some time to kill. Aw, what the hell... could be good for background
noise if nothing else...<br><br>So having sat through SD the Movie, what do I think? Well, as much as I
wanted to hate it because it was Hollywood raping my childhood, I just
couldn't. I'm not going to say I loved it because that wouldn't be true,
but
I'll be darned if I can't admit that it was a whole hell of a lot better
than I expected. Let me fill you in;<br><br>The cast is incredible. They have a real on-screen chemistry that really
makes the movie for me. Especially Matthew Lillard as Shaggy... if he
hasn't
just completely NAILED the character as perfectly as you could in live
action, then I'm the queen of France. There's the romantic attraction
between Daphne and Fred that comes out on-screen pretty much throughout,
and
of course the distant attraction Velma had for Fred is right there too.
But
do I detect a little bit of an attraction to Shaggy? Don't remember that
in
the cartoon... but I can accept that.<br><br>The story? Well, it's a hell of a lot better written than the cartoons!
Yes,
it borrows heavily from them (and borrows from some of the SD animated
movies that have been made in the interim), but still it's an interesting
story with a nice twist at the end that had me actually laughing out
loud.
Not Shakespeare by any stretch of the imagination... but a fun and
engaging
story that keeps your attention.<br><br>So what about the CGI Scoob? Wow is all I can say! I don't know what
makes
it more, the quality of the CGI or the way in which all the actors really
made me believe they were sharing the screen with a 6'5"" intelligent dog.
The interactions were believable, and not once did I catch anyone making
the
mistake of looking in the wrong place on-screen (which is clearly evident
in
many instances where CGI characters are used). The personality is
captured
perfectly and translates Scooby from the two-color animation of my youth
to
a perfect rendition of how I envisaged him in my minds eye.<br><br>I'm sure many have heard about them already, but there are plenty of
in-jokes that pepper the movie for those willing to pay attention. I
won't
say they're all laugh-out-loud funny, but they are amusing... and it was
obvious pretty early on that the film-makers didn't like Scrappy Doo
either
(I know I didn't... I didn't even like him as a kid), but rather than
pretend he never happened (*cough* Galactica 1980 *cough*) they actually
bring him to life in this movie too... and actually he has one of the
lines
that made me laugh out loud (to those who have seen it, it's the line he
never finishes saying...)<br><br>So did I love it as much as I loved Scooby as a kid? No. The movie was
definitely not without flaws, and it did depart from the cartoons in some
pretty major ways; for example one of the nice things about the cartoon
(looking at it now from an adult's perspective) was that at the end of
every
episode it was reiterated however lightly that there are no such things
as
monsters, ghosts, ghouls etc. and that we as people are always
responsible
for these things. This is something I picked up on as a kid but didn't
understand until I was an adult; and kids should be given that
reassurance
early in life that there are no monsters. The movie departed from that
part
of the formula... so personally I couldn't recommend the movie to younger
(under about 8 or 9) children. However, even with these kids, recommend
that
a parent watch it with them... but of course there's plenty of adult-type
humor in there too that will completely pass the kids by. To me that's
the
mark of a great kids movie these days; the ability to appeal to all
ages.<br><br>Overall, I'd say a 7 out of 10.

I've always been a big fan of horror films and when I was too young to
watch them, SCOOBY was my favourite cartoon because it had cool heroes and
I
could see all sorts of monsters in it. Even now that I'm an adult, I still
find a lot of pleasure in watching an episode. Just to say that I wasn't
very excited at the perspective of seeing my cult cartoon turned into an
unnamable stuff as the first pictures in the magazines announced a
visually
ridiculous movie with probably (like most of the other TV series
adaptations) a boring and incoherent script.<br><br>When I left the theater, I was in love with this movie. It's a Scooby
fan's
dream come true.The film's never ridiculous: a colourfull and coherent
universe was built around the visual of the cartoon. It's a very rare
thing
but this time, an exact transposition of a cartoon is perfect and doesn't
breed an example in visual bad taste.<br><br>The script intelligently breaks several rules of the cartoon in order to
bring more deepness to the characters. For example, Daphne's tired to be
the
eternal ""stupid"" beauty in danger and Velma can't stand Fred's attitude
anymore as he always acts as if he had solved the mysteries alone. But
these
efforts would have been vain if a ""dream team"" of actors hadn't been
gathered around the hilarious Scooby. Even if the team's composed of five
characters, they're all treated with
the same importance, and that's rare enough to be underscored.<br><br>Matthew LILLARD IS Shaggy: he reproduces perfectly the attitude of the
animated character and his capacity to make you believe in the virtual
Scooby is very impressive: when he's with him, you feel like if the dog
was
really on the set. The duo's perfect.<br><br>Sarah Michelle GELLAR and Freddie PRINZE Jr have a very communicative
energy. It's obvious that they had a very good time playing the two
""beautiful and quite stupid"" characters of the team. Even if
the
role of Daphne was written with ""Buffy"" references, Sarah Michelle GELLAR
succeeds in preserving the essence of the character: I never thought about
Buffy when I saw her as Daphne.<br><br>And the last but not the least, Linda CARDELLINI delivers an outstanding
performance as Velma. She took the animated character and managed to make
her more human, funnier and even touching by bringing all sorts of
irresistible details and mimics as for example in the way she laughs or
says
that she's the most clever of the team. Great job for a great
actress.<br><br>I hope that no sequel will ever reach the screen if any of them is missing
from the cast.<br><br>The story's quite simple but very well paced and entertaining. There are
lots of cool dialogues and ""private jokes"" for the series' fans. All the
gags are in the tone of the cartoon and always effective. I wasn't in
favor
of the use of martial arts through the character of Daphne but finally,
kung
fu fits in the universe of SCOOBY DOO as it's used with parsimony to bring
a
few more good gags.<br><br>As a conclusion, I would say that SCOOBY DOO's a terrific movie: it's fun,
fast and very well acted.I found in it everything that made me love the
cartoon and even more. Don't miss it if you're a SCOOBY
fan: you won't regret it!

I watched Scooby Doo, the cartoon, only with medium level interest as a
child, so I went (with my wife and kids) mostly as a kick.  Matthew Lillard
is brilliant as Shaggy (how is that possible?  His impersonation skills
were
flawless!).  The cartoonimation of Scooby and Scrappy Doo were interesting
but were so 3-D rendered that they did not match the original 2-D versions
very well.  The plot was reasonably interesting and twisted.  No mere
disgruntled janitor in a spooky disguise-- there's some evil genius at
work.
There were some minor plot issues with Velma, Fred, and Daphne having much
greater insecurity issues than in the cartoons, but experimenting with such
ideas is very cartoon-like.  The set and cast worked very well.  There's
some biological humor with Shaggy and Scooby that I did not expect, but the
last bit that they did helped.  If you're prudish about gas-passing and
belching, there are about 4 minutes you can do without, but they seem very
much in character.

This movie works because it tries to mimic the cartoon in many ways. Even
the first shot looks like the first shot of the cartoon with the fog and the
creepy old house. I had originally thought that the CGI Scooby would bother
me during the movie, but I was completely wrong. I only really thought about
that the first time Scooby is shown. After that the dog was Scooby to me
because the things he says and the way he says them are accurate to the
cartoon. The movie is pure cheese, but so was the cartoon. ""Scooby-Doo"" has
maybe the most effective farting scene since ""Blazing Saddles."" Most fart
scenes just come off as gross and not very funny, but in the world of Scooby
a fart scene works. One interesting aspect of the film was seeing Rowan
Atkinson in a role where he actually talks...a lot! I hope he gets more
chances at dialogue-heavy roles here in the States.  Fred, Daphne, Velma and
Shaggy all feel like their cartoon counterparts adding to the effectiveness
of the movie. Lillard is amazing as Shaggy because he gets his voice to
sound like a carbon-copy of the cartoon Shaggy. This is a fun movie to watch
because you can turn your brain off and just enjoy the
show.

This might be a disappointment to die hard Scooby Doo cartoon fans, but I
enjoyed it.  I thought the gags were hilarious, and since I never cared
for
Scrappy Doo, I was especially fond of the end.  I think Matthew Lillard
should get an academy award for the way he interacted to a character that
wasn't even there.  In my mind, every time I see a Scooby Doo cartoon, I
will picture him as Shaggy.  It also brought the characters even more
alive
for me when the ""human"" sides of their personalities came out.  It's
really
reaching to think that a group of people would be able to spend that much
time together and not have individual jealousies and get on each other's
nerves.  I can't wait to see the sequel.

I really think that this movie was pretty good.  Some parts in the movie
were really funny.  This casting was also good, the actors played the
characters pretty well.  I also think it was funny because in cases they
made fun of the cartoon.  Although, I didn't really like the villians.  I
could think of some better villians for the movie, but it just made it more
interesting in the end.  Over all - my rating: 8.

Scooby and the gang investigate a mystery on Spooky Island.<br><br>OK...this is NOT a good movie.  The jokes are very obvious and the PG rating
keeps things very clean and family friendly.  Still, I was laughing a lot. 
Maybe it was my mood, but I kept giggling over all the jokes.  It works
mostly because the entire cast plays it straight.<br><br>Sarah Michelle Gellar looks nothing like Daphne in the cartoon, but she is
good. Likewise, Freddie Prinze Jr. looks nothing like Fred either, but he's
OK.  Matthew Lillard, however, is letter perfect as Shaggy.  Also the woman
playing Velma is right on target.  And the CGI Scooby was just great...his
expressions and body language provided lots of laughs.  Great special effect
and the movie moves quickly.<br><br>My only real complaint--did we really need a burping/breaking wind contest
between Scooby and Shaggy?<br><br>A very good family movie--I liked it a lot. A very guilty favorite all the
way.<br><br>

Scooby-Doo is a worthy live action film to a brilliant original T.V.
show<br><br>Plot: The Mystery Inc. gang have split up and are each off on their
own, only Scooby-Doo (Voice of Neil Fanning) and Shaggy (Matthew
Lilard) remain together and they own the Mystery Machine. They are
called back into action when a strange man shows up and invites them to
Spooky Island to solve a mystery. They are convinced when he mentions
an all you can eat buffet and are on their way to the airport. There
they run into the rest of the gang, Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Velma
(Linda Cardellini), and Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar). Still resenting
each other they refuse contact and once on the island they meet the
owner, Emile Mondavariours (Rowan Atkinson) who informs them of the
problem. He believes that somebody is casting a spell on the visitors
who come to his resort. Starting off on looking for clues by themselves
the gang realizes after a attack that they need to put their
differences aside and team up if they ever want to solve the mystery.<br><br>The Good News: This being the motion picture film to a T.V. series that
spawned thousands of imitators it had a lot to live up to and it
delivers. Since it was released people have bashed this film to pieces,
but if you take a minutes and look at it closely it is a pretty
underrated film. The actors all do an outstanding job at bringing the
gang to life. At first glance Freddie Prinze Jr. may seem like the
wrong choice, but he fills Fred's shoes amazingly well with adequate
skill. Linda Cardellini portrays the brainy smart Velma we all know,
but Linda plays her with a sensitive side which is new and a a nice
choice. Sharah Michelle Gellar is the shining light here bringing
warmth and believability to her character as Daphne, everyones favorite
danger prone female who proves she is tougher than most think in one of
the film's best scenes. Matthew Lillard plays Shaggy well and plays off
of Scooby-Doo well even though there was nothing there during filming.

During World War II when the Americans needed to find a secure method of communicating they devised a code using the Navajo language. So Navajos were recruited to become what they call code talkers.

One of these men is Joe Enders, a man who sustained an injury that can make him unfit for duty but he manages to avoid it and is told of his duty and that the man he is suppose to protect is Ben Yahzee.

There\'s a fine line between the Method actor and the schizophrenic.      I am not a demon. I am a lizard, a shark, a heat-seeking panther. I want to be Bob Denver on acid playing the accordion.      [about his marriage to Lisa Marie Presley] I\'m sad about this, but we shouldn\'t have been married in the first place.      Hollywood didn\'t know if I was an actor or a nut or if I was this crazy character I was playing. I had developed an image of being a little bit unusual, different and wild.      I\'m at the point now where I know I\'m doing something right when a movie gets mixed reviews, because then I\'m not in the box. I don\'t want to make it too easy for people and I don\'t want to make it too easy for myself. I want to try something unusual. I feel good about the bad reviews because I feel like I\'ve affected them on some level. They may not know what I was trying to do but they felt something.      I want to make all kinds of movies. I do want to make big movies that are a lot of fun to go to, but I also want to make movies that are going to stimulate some thought and maybe raise some awareness. And so please don\'t think you\'re gonna go on a roller-coaster ride with those movies.      It\'s very risky for an actor who\'s a bankable star to make pictures like The Weather Man (2005) or Lord of War (2005) because they inevitably promote them like big studio releases. And they\'re not big studio movies, they\'re more edgy, thought-provoking, independent-spirited films. What happens is, it goes into the computer, and everyone says they can\'t open the movie because they thought it was X when it actually was Y.      I needed to change my name just to liberate myself and find out I could do it without walking into a Hollywood casting office with the name Coppola.      [Pablo Picasso] said art is a lie that tells the truth. What if you just want to tell the truth and not lie about it?      It\'s good to make movies that are tragedies, where people can think about things in life that are undeniable, that everyone has to deal with. But at the same time, it\'s also healing to make movies that are entertaining, that are a lot of fun, where you don\'t have to think about your problems.      When I did Vampire\'s Kiss (1988), I got so wound up. It was so important to me that this vision I had of Peter Lowe\'s character get on film exactly the way that I wanted it, that I frankly don\'t think I was very easy for anyone to live with. Certainly, I was not easy for myself to live with. I remember that I wasn\'t drinking or anything at the time. One night I felt so wound up that I was about to snap. I ordered a martini. And I just relaxed, and I could tell my body really needed a rest. From then on, I learned you can do good work without torturing yourself.      What happens is, you become different people in your path as an actor. When I was doing those things, I was a very new actor. I didn\'t have a lot of training, and I was trying to make some sort of impact, because that was what was important for me at the time - to get on the map. There were things I would do that were more shocking, or approaches I would do to try and live the character, because I didn\'t have the training. But then, as I went on, I started to find other methods, ways to get into characters that weren\'t exactly destroying my life. (On the wild eccentrics he used to get into character earlier in his career)      I remember when I met Johnny Depp, he was a guitar player from Florida, and he had no idea he could be an actor. I said, ""I really think you are an actor, that you have that ability."" That was just from playing one game of Monopoly with him. I sent him to my agent and he has gone on to carve out a successful career.      There is a method of thought that says it\'s better to stay mysterious, make yourself an event so when you come out, people have a hunger to see you again. I can think of some superstars who adopt that principle, where they are very selective. But we are all going to get older, and there is something to be said about doing some of your best work when you are younger, when you still have that virility, something visceral and raw. I\'ve heard there have been some actors who\'ve regretted not doing more work when they were under fifty. (On why he works so much)      [on making his character in Knowing (2009) a single father] I have seen a lot of movies with single mothers and their children. They\'re good, but there are not so many with capable single fathers. There seems to be this archetype that if you\'re a man and single, you\'re incapable of raising a child, which I think needs to be broken. If you find yourself in that position - like I have - it\'s important not to give up because of what people tell you.      [on Face/Off (1997)] Without tooting my own horn - I think it\'s a masterpiece.      I was being stalked by a mime - silent but maybe deadly. Somehow, this mime would appear on the set of set of Bringing Out the Dead (1999) and start doing strange things. I have no idea how it got past security. Finally, the producers took some action and I haven\'t seen the mime since. But it was definitely unsettling.      (The hardest part was) trying to figure out how I was going to entertain you while playing a guy who was completely out of his mind on crack. At the same time, trying to be responsible so it didn\'t become an advertisement for doing drugs. The other thing is, I wasn\'t sure I could play the part totally sober, which I was. In Leaving Las Vegas (1995), I had a few drinks between scenes to get to a certain feeling, to get to a certain truth. But with this I was trying to look at it more impressionistically from a landscape of maybe 25 years ago to see what would come out of that filter of my imagination. -- on the toughest aspect of preparing for The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans (2009)      So many directors are so arrogant. For example, Klaus Kinski -- who Werner Herzog has a legacy with -- he was very frustrated with the arrogance. We always hear Werner\'s side of the story about ""Klaus was this and Klaus was that"" but you never get to here Klaus\' side of the story. I was doing a scene (on ""Bad Lieutenant"") -- it was in my second day of shooting -- and we all know the imagination and preparation (required) to think I was on cocaine (for the character). There was a little bottle of baby powder, and I\'m snorting that. I\'m psyching up, I\'m psyching up, and he comes up and says (in German accent), ""Now Nicolas, what is in that vial?"" And I was like, ""Are you kidding me? After four hours of this you\'re gonna actually ask me that? Take me out of my preparation? You would think the director would understand the actor\'s process and give us the space and the room to do what it is we need to do.      I don\'t want to minimize the effort that goes into having a career, but now with the video age, let\'s face it, you can write your own stories and you can make your own movies and get it out. Or go on stage somewhere in a small venue off-off-off-Broadway.      Usually it\'s very cathartic. The hard stuff is when you\'re not feeling great and you have to do a really happy scene. -- on the personal toll acting can take on a person.James Dean in East of Eden (1955), the scene where he\'s trying to give Raymond Massey the money on his father\'s birthday. I was 14, I was at the New Beverly Cinema, and I said, ""Oh, no, that is exactly how I feel. Oh my God, I have to do this. Nothing else ever affected me as strongly. -- on if there were any moments in his life when he realized he was going to be an actor.      {on the recession] People are losing their jobs because of what\'s going on in the economy, but I want to make movies that give families something to look forward to.      (1996 quote) Jim Carrey and I went to George Hamilton\'s wine bar. He\'s an interesting one. He was there and had some fun stories. I told him how he was one of my heroes from the time he played Evel Knievel. We had cigars, and very expensive bottles of wine were opened, and Jim and I were going, ""This is great, man."" At the end of the night we got slapped with an $8,000 bill. It was at that point that George became the fox in the Pinocchio story. He happens to look quite a bit like that fox. I would not want to play cards with George Hamilton.      (1996) I remember my prom was a complete disaster. I used bonds my grandmother had given me to rent a tuxedo and a limousine so I could go to the prom with this beautiful girl. And at the end of the night I went to kiss her and she responded. I was so nervous that my stomach got really nauseous and I said, ""Excuse me"" and just threw up on the street all over my shoes and my rented tux. The limo driver wouldn\'t let me in the car. He split and I had to walk home. That was my prom night.      (1996, on if he wants to do theater work) No, I have stage fright. I don\'t like it. I\'ve never gotten over it.      (1996) I do not have a religion in my life, I wasn\'t raised that way. My father always believed that if I was going to have a religion I should discover it on my own and not have it crammed down my throat at a young age. I kind of wish I had some religion.      (1996) If I thought about awards, I would not have been able to do a movie like Leaving Las Vegas, because the word around town was that Mike [Figgis] and I were making the most unreleasable movie in Hollywood. I had some fear that the movie would not get released.      (1996, on his life) I know what I want to do, I\'m doing it, but I\'m still very much a student of the craft and I think I can go further. I still torment myself. I have a lot of self-doubt.      (1998 quote) I was once surrounded by rattlesnakes in a rattlesnake patch with my cousin Roman when we were 16 or 17. We were fishing in Napa Valley and walked right into it. There was a huge one coiled in front of us. A bigger one, to the left, was uncoiled, so I knew he wasn\'t a problem. We had to go over the coiled one, so we felt trapped and paralyzed with fear. There was nowhere to run, we were surrounded. I saw this pole with a nail through it, and I knew that I had to do something, so I grabbed the pole and pounded the snake. Then it came up and started rattling and was about to strike. I killed it, but felt bad about it. I felt anything you kill you\'ve got to eat, so I took it home, cut the poison glands out, took the rattles off and cooked it.      (1998, on the scariest thing that has happened to him) Years ago I was driving a car I\'d bought, an Austin Healey with a V-8 engine, sort of a makeshift Cobra. I had taken it to a mechanic to put an automatic shifter in it. The mechanic did a really sloppy job. If you barely knocked the shifter it would go into separate gears. I was driving on the Hollywood Freeway and I accidentally bumped it into park. I was doing 80 mph at 10 p.m. and I started doing 360s. I wound up facing traffic, and then a Mack truck was coming at me. I thought, \'This is it, I\'m dead\'. The truck driver had a CB radio and said, ""Put the car in reverse."" I did and drove backwards until I got off at the exit, backwards!      (1998 quote) What I like so much about Warhol-and he\'s actually influenced my acting, especially with Wild at Heart (1990)-is that he takes these icons and makes them his own, which is a brave thing to do. With acting it\'s not something you\'re supposed to do-you\'re never supposed to mimic or copy another person. For Wild at Heart (1990) I thought, \'Let\'s be Elvis\'. I\'ve always called that my Warhol performance, because I tried to subvert the image.      (1998, Movieline Magazine) I did not want to be in Peggy Sue Got Married (1986). I turned it down three times. Francis said, ""I really need you to be in the movie."" I read the script, which was a perfectly romantic film, but the character he wanted me to play was boring. He was the babe to Kathleen Turner\'s starring role. Just like women don\'t want to play the babe in movies, I didn\'t want to be Kathleen Turner\'s babe. I just wanted to play a character. So I thought, How can I make this guy really far out? I asked Francis about it on the phone and he said, Absolutely. I said, ""I want to go really far out."" He asked, ""How far do you want to go?"" I said, ""I want to talk like Pokey"" Because to me it was funny. And also, it was the way a lot of guys in high school sounded before their voices changed-they always had this high-sounding voice that would crack. When I see the movie now I\'m really happy that I did that. I really am.      (1998, Movieline Magazine) I see Miles Davis as a surrealist father of mine. He was the first person to believe in me as an actor, the one who first said he understood what I was talking about. It was on The Dick Cavett Show (1968). Before we went on he said to me, ""Why aren\'t you wearing your leather jacket? Didn\'t you learn anything from Dennis Hopper?"" Because I was wearing a suit. Then I went out and started talking about how if Picasso could paint surreal, why couldn\'t actors try to achieve that as well? Then Miles came on, and he was very considerate and he said, ""I hear what you\'re saying."" He kept looking at me like we had our own connection. Ever since then he stayed in my thoughts. He said the words I needed to hear to keep going with my choices. It\'s weird because my surrealist name, Cage, is actually taken from a black character, Luke Cage.      The first time that I played Ghost Rider (2007). Blaze was easy; I knew he was a man who had been living with a curse for 8 years of having his head light on fire, and the tone that would take. I compared him to a cop, or a paramedic who develops a dark sense of humour to cope with the horrors he has seen. But Blaze has also caused the horrors, so he\'s hiding out because he doesn\'t want to hurt anyone else. Ghost Rider was an entirely new experience, and he got me thinking.      I think that Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2011) was mentally taxing, if only because I had to go to a Christmas party shortly after I had wrapped photography in Romania at 2 in the morning as the Ghost Rider. The invitation had a Christmas ornament on it with Ghost Rider\'s face on it as a tree. I had a couple of schnapps and went to the party; I had not entirely let go of whatever magic I had been channelling, and all hell broke lose. In fact, I think I kept saying over and over: ""Merry Christmas, you assholes!"" I am lucky I\'m not in a Romanian prison.      Superman is an American myth. Like the English have Shakespeare.      I would like to see a sequel to Lord of War (2005). I think it would work really well, especially in this day and age where guns are at the center of political discussion. And also the boy in the movie, my son, there\'s this idea that he grows up and he goes into the trade and then I\'m trying to get him out of it. I think that could be a very interesting movie.      I hate violence. I just hate it. I read the paper every day - the New York Times, The Guardian - and I feel it, you know? It gets inside. I\'m amazed that people are capable of those kinds of things to children and women.      I\'m up for anything that will get me to the truth of a performance.      There\'s very few things that make me laugh. Mike Myers as Austin Powers makes me laugh - that was genius - and Daffy Duck makes me laugh, but I like odd behavior. I don\'t like hip dialogue and one-liners and all that sort of cool, sophomoric comedy. It\'s just not for me.      I\'m one of those guys where the more coffee I drink, the more stunts I do, the more relaxed I get.      [on having a stalker] That was horrible. I mean, that\'s as bad as it gets: 2am and there\'s a naked man standing in front of your bed watching you sleep. It\'s not funny, but somehow people find it amusing.      Halloween is a great holiday for any actor if you think about it. It\'s all about dress-up and playing characters. So yeah, it\'s always had a special place for me.      [on the most haunted place he\'s ever been to] There\'s a house I used to live in called The LaLaurie Mansion on Royal Street in New Orleans, and it\'s notorious as the most haunted house in the United States. I spent time in there alone in total darkness to get some inspiration to write the great American horror novel, but I didn\'t get far. I\'m not gonna go into detail.      Film acting is one of the only industries where you\'re criticized for working hard. In any other industry it\'s considered a quality and something to behold.      I haven\'t isolated myself. I am not living on a yacht somewhere. I am not tucked away or behind a gate somewhere. I am not flying on a private plane. I am going to the airport, I am with people, some of the interactions are good, some of them are not so good, but it keeps me in touch with being, you know, part of society. And I think that\'s necessary to stay relevant to be able to tell stories about people, which is what actors do.      Sometimes your very own family that you\'re close to can be toxic. They take your success or your potential as a personal insult on their failure, and they beat you up or they say you\'ll never make it.      Now even the art of film criticism... now in the LA Times, the critic who reviewed The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans (2009), incorporated how many homes I bought or sold into the review. What the hell does Lindsay Lohan\'s personal life have to do with her performance in The Canyons (2013)? It should always be about the work itself. What difference does it make if Bill Clinton had an affair -- how does that affect his performance as President?      I started acting because I wanted to be James Dean. I saw him in Rebel Without a Cause (1955), East of Eden (1955). Nothing affected me -- no rock song, no classical music -- the way Dean affected in ""Eden."" It blew my mind. I was like, ""That\'s what I want to do."" This was before everyone had a thing called a Smartphone, and before the advent of the ""celebutard"" -- just being famous for famous\' sake. I\'m not complaining, but it really sucks to be famous right now.      I am in the process of reinventing myself. I am returning to my roots, which is independently spirited, dramatic characters. I had taken a year off to re-evaluate everything I had done, different kinds of performances I had done, the more operatic and more baroque stuff like Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2011), Drive Angry (2011) or Season of the Witch (2011). I wanted to find something where I could use my life experience, my memories and my emotions.""      I started acting because I wanted to be James Dean. I saw him in Rebel Without a Cause (1955), East of Eden (1955). Nothing affected me - no rock song, no classical music - the way Dean affected in Eden. It blew my mind. I was like, \'That\'s what I want to do.\' This was before everyone had a thing called a Smartphone - just being famous for famous\' sake. I\'m not complaining, but it really sucks to be famous right now.      I don\'t take criticism seriously and I don\'t take praise seriously, both would be a mistake. If you buy into the negative that is the Internet today, or the cynical critic, it\'s not unlike listening to an abusive father that\'s trying to cave you in and you can\'t function. If you buy into praise, to people who adore you, you might get lazy and say, \'Well, I\'ll just keep doing that.\' You have to stay uncomfortable. I learned that from David Bowie. I said, \'How do you do it? How do you keep reinventing yourself?\' He said, \'I just never got comfortable with anything I was doing.\' I knew those were words of wisdom from a great artist and I took those words seriously.      I\'d love to make a movie with Jack Nicholson. I don\'t know why it hasn\'t happened yet! But I think the two of us together, would [laughs] ... I\'m sure it would be something to talk about! I feel very comfortable with him and I think we would do something special together.      [on being sought by Cher to join the cast of Moonstruck (1987)] I don\'t really know why she wanted me in the movie. She kept fighting for me. She saw me in Peggy Sue Got Married (1986) and said it was like watching a two-hour train wreck. It was pretty intimidating to be her leading man.      [on developing performance style] I [wanted]to get more \'quietude\' - what Hemingway would call the taut fishing line. I wanted to have that simplicity again. Joe (2013) gave me the opportunity to explore that.. I see myself as a student. I\'ll hopefully do more seasoned kinds of performance as I get older.      [advice to aspiring screen actors] If you\'re doing something really extraordinary, chances are you\'ll be an original. That might scare some people in the casting office. They might not know what to do with that. What I would suggest is to put a frame on it. Tape your audition. Put your performance in a frame so they can see it, and then go into the office. But I would send the tape. If you are genuinely talented, you are to be doing things that are special. So put a frame on it.      When I did Joe (2013) it was an opportunity for me to get what I call \'naked\' as a film presence. It was time to not put things on top of a performance, but take things off - where I could take my life experience of the last years and find a script where I didn\'t have to act. Where I could just be, and not think too much about it. What was a great compliment was when my wife saw it with me in Venice and said, \'That\'s you\'.      I try to pick ans choose my material based on what I can do to challenge myself and make myself uncomfortable. Always stay a student, never be a maestro.      There is a mischievous mind at work on The Wicker Man (2006), you know? You know what I mean? And I finally kind of said, \'I might have known that the movie was meant to be absurd.\' But saying that now after the fact is OK, but to say it before the fact is not, because you have to let the movie have its own life.

A troubled childhood saw his mother killed by a drunk driver, and his alcoholic father drowned only weeks afterward. The three brothers went to live with their grandmother and then with their uncle and aunt in Winnipeg, where Adam joined drama classes and began acting in local theatre productions.Since then he has appeared in over 60 films and television programs. His performance in the Academy Award-nominated Clint Eastwood-directed Flags of Our Fathers (2006) was phenomenal. He played Ira Hayes, a Pima Native American who was one of the six US Marines to raise the American flag on Iwo Jima and who found the resulting fame hard to handle, subsequently giving way to alcoholism. This alone would have been an emotional role for Adam to play; however, during filming, both his grandmother and best friend passed away. His role as Hayes is both realistic and heartbreaking, earning him two Best Supporting Actor Award Nominations. He stands out well above the rest of the cast.Adam has been further nominated for three Awards for his role in Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (2007) including a Golden Globe.

""I liked the way that film took realistic events and added this slightly out-of-kilter perspective. My character in that film was, in one sense, a caricature of a killer, but there was also a sense of mystery surrounding him that captured the imagination. Fargo (1996) was an exciting experience for me largely because of the approach the Coen brothers took. It was the antithesis of Armageddon (1998). It was low-budget, a very guerrilla-style approach to filmmaking that made its own rules and was very specific in what it was trying to accomplish."" --on Fargo (1996).      ""I was a foreigner, and I knew that most of the parts I would be offered would be foreigners. I knew I could not compete with Bruce Willis, Tom Cruise, and Nicolas Cage, and so I did not fight it. I saw the path I was destined to walk and decided to do the parts that would be offered to me as well as I possibly could."" --on his initial career outlook when he first came to the U.S. to act.      Upon receiving the Fargo (1996) script: ""Where are all my lines?!""      I\'ve done Hamlet, and no one talks about Hamlet killing five people. No one even talks about sending him to jail. And it\'s the same thing for a character like Abruzzi. I think people root for him because he\'s just punishing people who are bad humans in a way. Always in movies and TV, in drama we always root for those characters. Even if they have killed four or five people, they have killed people that we\'ve really disliked. They have done us a service. And he\'s such a character. That\'s why I\'ve tried to keep him very Shakespearean. --talking about his character John Abruzzi from Prison Break (2005)      They [the Coen Brothers] have an obsession with pancakes. It\'s a Midwestern thing, I guess. I had never had pancakes. I grew up in Sweden, and I\'m not a big fan of pancakes.      Yeah, prep is very important -- for me, at least. I like to improvise. But if you\'re the only one improvising, then you can f**k it up for other actors in the scene if you\'re the only one coming up with new things. Sometimes it can be good, and the director tells you to do something to stir or awaken the actors whom you\'re playing with, or they do it to you and you have a great reaction. But I think it\'s the directors who especially need to prepare their work. A lot of young directors today work on digital and run the cameras 24/7, and it\'s tedious for an actor to do the same scene over and over again. When a director is prepped, you feel very secure, and you become a better actor. He knows what he wants and he\'s like, ""Okay, let\'s move on to the next scene.""      There are so many people who hate themselves, and I realized early on that you can\'t change your looks. You have to live with what you\'ve got. And you have to give yourself credit every morning by saying ""yes!"" -- and that\'ll help you. But if you dis yourself every morning, it\'s not good for you mentally, and it won\'t help your appearance. It\'s not that I love my looks. But ... it\'s me.

A dinner jacket used to mean a tuxedo, you know?      I\'m not really a zombie genre guy; I\'m not particularly versed in it. Doing \'The Walking Dead\' sort of turned me on to the whole thing.      I did do a war movie, \'Windtalkers.\' That was a lot of action. But once you\'ve done one big action/war movie, you don\'t need to do another one.      After every movie, you get offered the role that you just did in the last movie.      A movie set or any set is a completely private place and it feels very insulated.

I learned a lot about World War II from this film. First of all, during
this war it was a custom of both the Japanese and Americans to scream
every time you shoot or get shot (even with about 30 bullets in your
chest you can still scream apparently). Secondly, Japanese soldiers do
not like cover. They like to stay out in the open, and will not fire
their rifles unless they're within 15 feet of American soldiers.
Thirdly, one man with a Thompson sub-machine gun can take out an entire
regiment of Japanese soldiers in an afternoon.<br><br>This film was completely first rate, start to finish. From the soldiers
who flail about wildly as entire belts of machine gun ammo are pumped
into them (before they drop to the ground mind you), to the 12 soldiers
that Nicholas Cage shoots with a handgun while laying on his back
wounded in the space of about 15 seconds, this film just screamed
realism and authenticity. Highly recommended to history buffs and
people who can appreciate some of the best acting ever put on film.

I thought this was a film about Navajo code talkers. Well, it's not. 
While there are a couple of Navajos in the film, the story revolves 
around Nicolas Cage winning WWII all by himself. This guy's incredible 
and makes John Wayne look like a wimp. Every time the Marines are in 
trouble, up jumps good old Nicolas Cage with his Thompson and POOF! the 
battle is WON! I wonder how we won WWII without Nicolas Cage? The film 
has a LOT of combat footage and most of that is very well done. That

film is about the Navajo indians and how their native language was used to

This showed up on the history channel and with the husband once again
off playing poker I thought, OK, time to ingest a little more history.
Only to end up retching over yet another Nicholas Cage bad movie. <br><br>Now, I just recently saw Con Air for the first time on STARz, so the
juxtaposition is unfortunate for his rating, but is he letting his
lizard tattoo or Elvis visitations determine his movie selections? Are
the script readings done by a psychic? Does he gravitate to stupid
characters?<br><br>I thought I was going to see something that was about World War II, but
actually I got to see a silly film filled with characters I've seen so
often I could have written this script myself during a silicon valley
traffic jam, and done a much better and far more historically accurate
job. They all trotted around after the usual conflicted Sergeant - or
is Nicolas Cage always conflicted (see fixations above)? - with a
Navajo Indian (instead of a representative of some other ethnic group)
thrown in to cause racial tension.<br><br>Let's see, we had the bullying racist, who then has his life saved by
an Indian (gee, there's a surprise), the panicking recruit who can't
take the pressure and trips the mine field (wow, didn't see that
coming), the accepting comrade who (symbolically) blends an harmonica
with the Indian's flute (but dies saving the Indian's life, ditto,
ditto), the young boy who must grow up too soon (ah, the poignancy),
the Army lieutenant that treats everyone like tools (not again!), the
mystic wisdom that teaches us all a little something, the constantly
breathy flute music (used with all cultural lessons) - have we endured
this one before? <br><br>Not really, because we've never seen quite so many battles, with so
many bodies (tossed so high in the air) before, or filmed in Utah while
pretending to be Iwo Jima. Was John Woo trying to win some kind of
battle-filming contest here? Well, I hope so, because he sure lost a
battle with the script.<br><br>Of course, we had the added stress for poor battle-worn Nicolas Cage
that he might have to shoot his code talker rather than have him fall
into enemy hands. Quite the sophisticated plot twist, that! Oh no, will
Nicolas get too close and feel bad if he has to shoot his young
trustee? More conflict! More angst! Cage's specialty! Makes the story
so much better, right? <br><br>Better, but not accurate. Reality: the code wasn't the language - it
was a derivative, based on, the Navajo language. If someone was
captured, the code would be changed. The prisoner might understand the
base language, but not the code itself. <br><br>Oh, yeah, periodically the Indians, who I believe were the original
inspiration for the movie, would get to talk back and forth in Navajo,
and we would get to see the translation on the screen. They would say
their position (not in actual code). Oh, and one time in the movie, the
Japanese noticed the Americans weren't speaking English. <br><br>And another time, according to the movie, the Japanese attempted to
capture an Indian who was just standing around the front line because
somehow they knew he was a code talker. Right. They guessed in the
middle of combat that he wasn't Hawaiian or Japanese American, he was
an American Indian. And they also had somehow figured out that the
language that wasn't English was a derivative of an American Indian
dialect, and therefore this man must be a Code Talker. Right there in
the middle of the battle. Alrighty then. (It must be similar wisdom
that causes me to doubt the veracity of this incident.) <br><br>These incidents brought history alive for me, alright.<br><br>Reality: Code talkers were translating messages NON STOP throughout the
taking of Iwo Jima. Which makes it difficult to understand how the
Navajos would have been hacking and shooting away on the battlefield,
or standing around the front lines, and going through that
growing-up-too-soon stuff. Reality: They were able to communicate three
times faster than previous codes had hustled along, but like any other
job, the number of messages increased to fill the time available. Seems
to be a bit of a discrepancy between busy busy real code talker life
and Hollywood. Oh, sorry. That's a duh.<br><br>In addition to not understanding the difference between a language and
a code (is this rocket science?) the soldiers in the film didn't even
wear the right dog tags. Reality: I've got my dad's dog tags from WWII,
and you can get a lovely facsimile at the Smithsonian gift store right
now. Were they not stylish enough? Was it more exciting to use choke
chain dog tags? Every time I saw a soldier I saw an anachronism. As in
big fat mistake.<br><br>I do appreciate that at least we have a movie in these Politically
Correct days where we had two sides to a war: good guys and bad guys.
You don't see that very often any more, so points to John Woo for that
one area.<br><br>But I'm getting away from what was really going on in the movie, which
was all about battered, bruised, benighted and badgered Nicholas Cage,
who talked to the Navajo like Clint Eastwood talked to the trees in
Paint Your Wagon. Not to mention the usual angst-ridden and conflicted
stuff he faces. I got very little wind talking, and an awful lot of
wind blowing out of this movie. <br><br>All it did for the important role the Navajo (and Comanche in the
European Theatre) Indians played during WWII was bring them up in
conversation - too many inaccuracies to be of any other use.

-Some spoilers- There's a rule in Hollywood that states, ""If you're
making a war-movie, you better make it damn patriotic"". With patriotic,
ridiculous often follows. This film presents it's patriotism in FORM of
ridiculous scenes. For example, there's a scene where IL' Nicholas Cage
gets blasted and falls to the ground, wounded. Quickly, a group of
Japanese soldiers start running towards him, but Nick managed to kill
them all in one second... Using one gun... Without even aiming. The
scene made me laugh out loud, and could be classified as one of the
funniest moments in film-history, ever, but unfortunately this gem is
overlooked.<br><br>Throw everything you know about films out the window. This film doesn't
have a plot, or any deep character. It doesn't have any realism, which
is customary for war films, nor does it have any good acting. So what
does it have? Lots and lots of action. More action than you can
imagine, actually. The film only has one purpose, to show off how the
brave marines kill as many enemy soldiers as possible. Explosions,
gunfire etc. etc.<br><br>Ed Wood could not have done a worse job than John Woo did when he put
this film together. It's simply that bad. Gather your friends, bust
open a few cans of beers and enjoy the ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" of the
21st century!

A war movie done John Woo-style sounded like such a good idea on paper.
The slow-motion action sequences and other typical Woo-ism elements are
often even more laughable than beautiful or realistic. Same goes for
the deeper and sentimental meanings of the movie.<br><br>It's obvious John Woo wanted to make a ""Saving Private Ryan"" realistic
like war movie but the movie gets stuck somewhere between Hollywood
action/war entertainment and a serious war movie.<br><br>The battle sequences look too fabricated and planned out, which is of
course a killer for the movie its realism. Sure the battle sequences
all look fine and it obvious cost some serious money to make this
movie.<br><br>Between all of the battles and action within the movie, there are lots
of slow moments. Guess it tries to be deep or something, also about the
Navajo-culture, in those moments but it instead feels pointless and
often like a drag. Same goes for most of the sentiments within the
movie. It's also the reason why the movie is quite long.<br><br>The movie is an underwritten one that for a genre movie is too
formulaic. It's mostly a predictable movie that offers very few
surprises or original moments. A shame, since the concept of the movie
is definitely an original one. The movie also doesn't bother to tell
where and why they are fighting. What are all these battles? Why are
they being fought? And yes, of course the movie also finds room to put
in a love-story. All of the character also remain pretty shallow one's,
no matter how far they dig into their past.<br><br>Nicolas Cage just wasn't made for these sort of movies. The movie is
filled with some other well known names in it and most of them do a
good job. It's not like the acting is one of the weakest elements of
the movie but that still doesn't mean that everyone was correctly cast.<br><br>It's definitely a watchable movie but its shortcomings just prevent
this movie from being a great or really memorable one.<br><br>6/10<br><br>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

First, the bad: Nicholas Cage's over-the-top, suicidal maniac, idiotic
self-pitying marine played with no subtlety at all. Peter Stormare's
lousiest performance to date, he's been going downhill since the
excellent work in FARGO. Perhaps that one was just luck for him, and a
good script. Excessive battle scenes, so much so as to give the viewer
shell-shock too. For these, a ONE.<br><br>The good: both Adam Beach and Roger Willie give solid, well-bodied
performances as the Navajo code talkers. The effort to recognize the
contribution of the Navajo code talkers is a very positive aspect here,
and for these reasons the film deserves a NINE. I give it an average of
FIVE.

It's nice to see World War II films making a comeback, as they have
seemed to do since the arrival of ""Saving Private Ryan"" in 1997. This
is another of them and with modern technology the viewers get to
experience some very realistic action scenes. The main thing is that
the story is interesting.<br><br>With a John Woo-directed film, you know are going to get tons of
action, almost always too much, and that's the case here. However, some
of the scenes are fantastic. You also get some beautiful
cinematography.<br><br>Still on the positive, the acting was good in here with Nicholas Cage
in the lead role and a lesser-name-but-good supporting cast. The story,
although fairly long at 134 minutes, was never boring.<br><br>On the negative side, as mentioned, Woo tends to overkill and this
movie must have a set record for number of people killed. It also leans
on the politically correct side, of course, with Native American
spirituality given complete reverence as usual and the Catholic (Cage)
looking like a very weak in his beliefs. In modern-days, you'll never
see the opposite shown on film.<br><br>Anyway, it's a good action movie that certainly entertains. The intense
and long action makes it almost too much to watch in one viewing!

I learned a lot about World War II from this film. First of all, during
this war it was a custom of both the Japanese and Americans to scream
every time you shoot or get shot (even with about 30 bullets in your
chest you can still scream apparently). Secondly, Japanese soldiers do
not like cover. They like to stay out in the open, and will not fire
their rifles unless they're within 15 feet of American soldiers.
Thirdly, one man with a Thompson sub-machine gun can take out an entire
regiment of Japanese soldiers in an afternoon.<br><br>This film was completely first rate, start to finish. From the soldiers
who flail about wildly as entire belts of machine gun ammo are pumped
into them (before they drop to the ground mind you), to the 12 soldiers
that Nicholas Cage shoots with a handgun while laying on his back
wounded in the space of about 15 seconds, this film just screamed
realism and authenticity. Highly recommended to history buffs and
people who can appreciate some of the best acting ever put on film.

I thought this was a film about Navajo code talkers. Well, it's not. 
While there are a couple of Navajos in the film, the story revolves 
around Nicolas Cage winning WWII all by himself. This guy's incredible 
and makes John Wayne look like a wimp. Every time the Marines are in 
trouble, up jumps good old Nicolas Cage with his Thompson and POOF! the 
battle is WON! I wonder how we won WWII without Nicolas Cage? The film 
has a LOT of combat footage and most of that is very well done. That

their position (not in actual code). Oh, and one time in the movie, the
Japanese noticed the Americans weren't speaking English. <br><br>And another time, according to the movie, the Japanese attempted to
capture an Indian who was just standing around the front line because
somehow they knew he was a code talker. Right. They guessed in the
middle of combat that he wasn't Hawaiian or Japanese American, he was
an American Indian. And they also had somehow figured out that the
language that wasn't English was a derivative of an American Indian
dialect, and therefore this man must be a Code Talker. Right there in
the middle of the battle. Alrighty then. (It must be similar wisdom
that causes me to doubt the veracity of this incident.) <br><br>These incidents brought history alive for me, alright.<br><br>Reality: Code talkers were translating messages NON STOP throughout the
taking of Iwo Jima. Which makes it difficult to understand how the
Navajos would have been hacking and shooting away on the battlefield,
or standing around the front lines, and going through that
growing-up-too-soon stuff. Reality: They were able to communicate three
times faster than previous codes had hustled along, but like any other
job, the number of messages increased to fill the time available. Seems
to be a bit of a discrepancy between busy busy real code talker life
and Hollywood. Oh, sorry. That's a duh.<br><br>In addition to not understanding the difference between a language and
a code (is this rocket science?) the soldiers in the film didn't even
wear the right dog tags. Reality: I've got my dad's dog tags from WWII,
and you can get a lovely facsimile at the Smithsonian gift store right
now. Were they not stylish enough? Was it more exciting to use choke
chain dog tags? Every time I saw a soldier I saw an anachronism. As in
big fat mistake.<br><br>I do appreciate that at least we have a movie in these Politically
Correct days where we had two sides to a war: good guys and bad guys.
You don't see that very often any more, so points to John Woo for that
one area.<br><br>But I'm getting away from what was really going on in the movie, which
was all about battered, bruised, benighted and badgered Nicholas Cage,
who talked to the Navajo like Clint Eastwood talked to the trees in
Paint Your Wagon. Not to mention the usual angst-ridden and conflicted
stuff he faces. I got very little wind talking, and an awful lot of
wind blowing out of this movie. <br><br>All it did for the important role the Navajo (and Comanche in the
European Theatre) Indians played during WWII was bring them up in
conversation - too many inaccuracies to be of any other use.

-Some spoilers- There's a rule in Hollywood that states, ""If you're
making a war-movie, you better make it damn patriotic"". With patriotic,
ridiculous often follows. This film presents it's patriotism in FORM of
ridiculous scenes. For example, there's a scene where IL' Nicholas Cage
gets blasted and falls to the ground, wounded. Quickly, a group of
Japanese soldiers start running towards him, but Nick managed to kill
them all in one second... Using one gun... Without even aiming. The
scene made me laugh out loud, and could be classified as one of the
funniest moments in film-history, ever, but unfortunately this gem is
overlooked.<br><br>Throw everything you know about films out the window. This film doesn't
have a plot, or any deep character. It doesn't have any realism, which
is customary for war films, nor does it have any good acting. So what
does it have? Lots and lots of action. More action than you can
imagine, actually. The film only has one purpose, to show off how the
brave marines kill as many enemy soldiers as possible. Explosions,
gunfire etc. etc.<br><br>Ed Wood could not have done a worse job than John Woo did when he put
this film together. It's simply that bad. Gather your friends, bust
open a few cans of beers and enjoy the ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" of the
21st century!

A war movie done John Woo-style sounded like such a good idea on paper.
The slow-motion action sequences and other typical Woo-ism elements are
often even more laughable than beautiful or realistic. Same goes for
the deeper and sentimental meanings of the movie.<br><br>It's obvious John Woo wanted to make a ""Saving Private Ryan"" realistic
like war movie but the movie gets stuck somewhere between Hollywood
action/war entertainment and a serious war movie.<br><br>The battle sequences look too fabricated and planned out, which is of
course a killer for the movie its realism. Sure the battle sequences
all look fine and it obvious cost some serious money to make this
movie.<br><br>Between all of the battles and action within the movie, there are lots
of slow moments. Guess it tries to be deep or something, also about the
Navajo-culture, in those moments but it instead feels pointless and
often like a drag. Same goes for most of the sentiments within the
movie. It's also the reason why the movie is quite long.<br><br>The movie is an underwritten one that for a genre movie is too
formulaic. It's mostly a predictable movie that offers very few
surprises or original moments. A shame, since the concept of the movie
is definitely an original one. The movie also doesn't bother to tell
where and why they are fighting. What are all these battles? Why are
they being fought? And yes, of course the movie also finds room to put
in a love-story. All of the character also remain pretty shallow one's,
no matter how far they dig into their past.<br><br>Nicolas Cage just wasn't made for these sort of movies. The movie is
filled with some other well known names in it and most of them do a
good job. It's not like the acting is one of the weakest elements of
the movie but that still doesn't mean that everyone was correctly cast.<br><br>It's definitely a watchable movie but its shortcomings just prevent
this movie from being a great or really memorable one.<br><br>6/10<br><br>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

First, the bad: Nicholas Cage's over-the-top, suicidal maniac, idiotic
self-pitying marine played with no subtlety at all. Peter Stormare's
lousiest performance to date, he's been going downhill since the
excellent work in FARGO. Perhaps that one was just luck for him, and a
good script. Excessive battle scenes, so much so as to give the viewer
shell-shock too. For these, a ONE.<br><br>The good: both Adam Beach and Roger Willie give solid, well-bodied
performances as the Navajo code talkers. The effort to recognize the
contribution of the Navajo code talkers is a very positive aspect here,
and for these reasons the film deserves a NINE. I give it an average of
FIVE.

It's nice to see World War II films making a comeback, as they have
seemed to do since the arrival of ""Saving Private Ryan"" in 1997. This
is another of them and with modern technology the viewers get to
experience some very realistic action scenes. The main thing is that
the story is interesting.<br><br>With a John Woo-directed film, you know are going to get tons of
action, almost always too much, and that's the case here. However, some
of the scenes are fantastic. You also get some beautiful
cinematography.<br><br>Still on the positive, the acting was good in here with Nicholas Cage
in the lead role and a lesser-name-but-good supporting cast. The story,
although fairly long at 134 minutes, was never boring.<br><br>On the negative side, as mentioned, Woo tends to overkill and this
movie must have a set record for number of people killed. It also leans
on the politically correct side, of course, with Native American
spirituality given complete reverence as usual and the Catholic (Cage)
looking like a very weak in his beliefs. In modern-days, you'll never
see the opposite shown on film.<br><br>Anyway, it's a good action movie that certainly entertains. The intense
and long action makes it almost too much to watch in one viewing!

The key is always to speak in your own voice. Speak the truth. That\'s Acting 101. Then you start putting layers on top of that.      I took a route of acting, rather than starmaking, so it cost me a lot financially.      [on his career choices] It\'s something that I\'ve been saying for years when people ask me how I pick the things that I do. I pick the things that scare me the most. You have to like the story first. I\'m not gonna play a part that doesn\'t instill some kind of fear in me. If I read a part, and suddenly, I\'m thinking halfway through, ""I\'m not sure I could get away with this"", I think of everything I can think of to keep me from doing it, that\'s the one I should do.      I am a method actor, but I\'m also a film actor as well as a method actor. Characters that don\'t have humility, whether they are heroes or villains, are hard to relate to. All characters in every aspect of what we do should have humility. If they don\'t, then they\'re a cartoon character. I know that during actual performance scenes, what I need to trigger myself off, and I know how to trigger it off so that it will trigger you off, which will also influence how you feel when I\'m expressionless.      I\'m not gonna make excuses for other actors. I\'m just talking about myself. The good actors that I\'ve met - I\'ve met some of the best actors that we\'ll ever see - and I know for sure the one thing that we all have in common when we all look in each other\'s eyes, is that we\'re all struggling to achieve 100%. That\'s all I see when I see another artist. All of us are trying to achieve 100% in our work. That\'s all we struggle to do. We never do, but we never stop trying until the day we die. It\'s that struggle to achieve 100%, that\'s where our performance lies, that\'s what the audience gets. They get the struggle.      [on being a ""Method"" actor] The thing is, it\'s the research that you do that is exhausting. That\'s what always affects you. When I did The Cell (2000)--no matter what you think of that movie, because I have my opinions of it, too--it was, you know, I still have nightmares from the research that I did. Not from playing the part, just from the research. There was stuff that I should have never looked at, that I should have never gone anywhere near. As a father, I can\'t imagine going to that place again. I\'m not saying I wouldn\'t, I\'m just saying it was too much.      [on his role in Ed Wood (1994)] I never was happy with the job I did in ""Ed Wood"". Even though [Tim Burton] was, I wasn\'t. Because it\'s not what I wanted, it\'s not what I wanted. First of all, the company, for whatever reason, not Tim, but the company took a very long time to hire me and I was busy doing another project. I eventually only ended up with three weeks to prepare for it and that bothered me. But, you know, I had to be brave and I had to do it the best I could. It was too much of a caricature. I didn\'t like it. It was too surface of a performance.      [on playing real-life characters] There\'s a lot of shame that goes on when you\'re playing someone who has really lived and has passed. You\'re struggling with it all the time. I am, anyway. When I played Robert Howard in The Whole Wide World (1996), I was struggling with it. There\'s this dual thing where you feel real good about being able to play this juicy part, and then there\'s constant shame: ""Who am I to pretend to know who this guy was? Who am I to represent this guy for people who never knew him?"" The pressure is unbelievable, I can\'t tell you.      Unless you look like Brad Pitt, it\'s really hard to have full control of your character.      The most fun you can possibly have as an actor is to walk that line between what\'s real and what\'s interesting.      The minute you start feeling like you\'ve got it down, you know what you\'re doing, you\'re dead in the water.      Acting is not a mystery. There\'s nothing that I know that other actors don\'t know. We all act, we\'re all actors, we all know the same thing. The only thing that separates us is experience.      What kind of recognition do I deserve? I don\'t deserve any recognition.      With [Robert] Altman, he does discuss everything with you, but then leaves you to it and gives you full rein and lets you improvise and create a character while the camera is rolling.      When I was younger I used to pick things just to face the fear.      The more you are known, the more difficult it is to hide behind characters.      When you are a character actor they trust you will go in and give them a full character and leave.      It\'s like why people read scary books or go see scary movies. Because it creates a distance. They\'re scared, but they\'re not going to get hurt.      When you\'re a child you\'re able to assimilate so easily into any situation. You even start talking like the people you\'re around. I wasn\'t conscious that I was so good at that until I started to truly feel like an actor.      To me the definition of true masculinity - and femininity, too - is being able to lay in your own skin comfortably.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nJena Malone ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 35 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(23)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(6)\xa0|Salary\xa0(1)  Overview (3)Date of Birth21\xa0November1984,\xa0Sparks, Nevada, USA Birth NameJena Laine MaloneHeight5\'\xa05""\xa0(1.65\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Jena Malone was born in Sparks, Nevada, to Deborah Malone and Edward Berge. Her grandfather owned a casino, Karl\'s Silver Club, in Sparks. She was raised by her mother and her mother\'s partner. Beginning as a child actress, and then stepping up to roles as a young adult, Malone\'s career path has been compared to that of Jodie Foster, herself a former child actress and who has co-starred with Malone in two movies. Jena is often described as having a maturity beyond her years and, in her career thus far, she has often tackled roles that are difficult and are not standard fare for actors her age.Malone\'s first claim to fame was in performing the title role in Bastard Out of Carolina (1996) for which she won the Young Artist Award, and which she filmed when she was merely ten years old. This movie dealt with issues of child abuse, violence and sex. Jena has said in later interviews that this movie and her participation in it continue to influence her life substantially.Showing self-assurance and a clear vision of personal goals from an early age, Jena, at age 14, was encouraged to try out for Air Force One (1997), a movie that was virtually guaranteed to be a success since box-office king Harrison Ford was cast in the lead, but Jena said she\'d prefer to seek other roles that were of more interest to her.In the following years, Malone appeared in several made-for-TV movies for which she won or was nominated for many awards. In 1997, she lucked in to being cast in the blockbuster Contact (1997) where she portrayed the child version of Jodie Foster\'s lead character. Foster stated that she built her character by mimicking Jena. And, in 1998, Jena was cast in the major film Stepmom (1998) where she co-starred with Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris. Jena was given what was likely the best line in that movie where her character, bitter over her parents\' divorce, confronts her father who has returned home briefly; at a moment of crisis, her dad tells her ""You do NOT run out on your mother"", and the rueful Malone exclaims ""No -- that\'s YOUR job"".Also, in 1998, Malone appeared in a two-part episode of the critically acclaimed TV series Homicide: Life on the Street (1993). Contrary to what might usually be expected of a teenage actress, in this episode, Jena played the complex role of the perpetrator of a crime, which she portrayed with subtlety.At age 15, Jena was legally emancipated and thus took direct control of her finances and her career. Malone began getting more attention and acclaim in her next set of films: the artistic cult film Donnie Darko (2001); the teenage journey The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys (2002) where she again co-starred with Jodie Foster; and the satirical Saved! (2004) which debuted Jena as the lead in a movie.Jena has expressed an interest in directing some day, and so she is preparing for roles behind the camera as well as in front. In 2002, she co-produced American Girl (2002) while also starring in it. And, in 2003, she undertook a formal study of photography.In early 2006, Malone debuted on the Broadway stage in the play ""Doubt"". A review by Broadway.com characterized her performance as ""astonishing"".Many people in Hollywood have jobs as actors. Watch for Jena Malone.

The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys is kind of like a cross between The
Virgin Suicides and Stand By Me. Set in the 70's (featuring many cool
70's haircuts) in small town Georgia, the story focuses on Francis, a
14-year-old dreamer and troublemaker. He and his pals, Tim, Wade, and
Joey cope with life under the oppressive rule of one-legged nun Sister
Assumpta (Jodie Foster) at the Puritan Christian high school they're
unfortunate enough to attend. <br><br>One of their methods of escape is the 'The Atomic Trinity' comic book.
Each of them have their own character with superpowers (such as The
Muscle, Captain Asskicker and Skeleton Boy), battling against the
tyrannical regime of Nunzilla/Pegleg (a gross caricature of Sister
Assumpta). These fantasy stories make up the terrific animated
sequences of the film. The cool thing is that they are not so totally
removed from the reality of Francis, Tim, Wade and Joey.<br><br>The boys soon find their way into a lot of trouble though. After
stealing the school's nun statue mascot the quartet plan to steal a
cougar from the zoo and put in Sister Assumpta's office. A mad plan
yes, but their determination and invention behind it is very clever.<br><br>Some scenes of the film are very emotional, so if you have soft spot
you'll find it tough to get through the scene where Tim finds a dying
dog by the side of the road or Francis reading a poem at the funeral.<br><br>Francis' relationship with Margie (the very cute Jenna Malone) also
takes many curious and unique turns. The scene with the ghost watching
them sleep was pleasingly weird. <br><br>Taken from the one and only book (posthumously) by Chris Fuhrman (a
book I must get as soon as I see), The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys is
attractively shot, wonderfully acted and definitely worth getting.<br><br>The DVD is in 1.85:1 widescreen (strangely non-anamorphic, though the
region 2 version is) with Dolby 5.1 sound and a mild bunch of extras.

In the Seventies, the fifteen years old troublemaker and leader altar
boy Tim Sullivan (Kieran Culkin) and his three great friends, Francis
Doyle (Emile Hirsch), Wade Scalisi (Jake Richardson) and Joey Anderson
(Tyler Long), study in a repressive Catholic school, and they hate
their nun-teacher Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster). Francis has a crush
on Margie Flynn (Jena Malone), who has a dramatic secret in her life.
They like to write a comic book called 'The Atomic Trinity' and all of
them have an alter-ego in their superheroes: Brakken (Francis), The
Muscle/Skeleton Boy later (Tim), Captain Asskicker (Wade) and Major
Screw (Joey), with Sorcerella (Margie) joining them later. Francis uses
to fantasize reality with the fantastic situations the heroes face
against the evil Nunzilla/Pegleg, a dark caricature of Sister Assumpta.
The group plots an evil prank against Sister Assumpta, with tragic
consequences.<br><br>""The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"" is a surprisingly great original
coming to age movie, one of the best I have ever seen in my life. The
group of friends recalled me 1986 ""Stand by Me"" or part of 1981 ""Four
Friends"" and the dramatic situation recalled somehow 1999 ""The Virgin
Suicides"". The screenplay, alternating animation with film, is great:
the boys escape and fantasize reality through their alter egos. The
performance of the young cast is also excellent. Jodie Foster, as the
severe teacher, and Vincent D'Onofrio, as Father Casey, magnificently
complete this wonderful cast. I could never imagine Jodie Foster in
such role. I highly recommend this great movie, much unknown here in
Brazil. My vote is nine.<br><br>Title (Brazil): ""Meninos de Deus"" (""Boys of God"")

I came across this indie gem one day at my local Blockbuster. I looked
at it and it seemed like it would be an o.k. way to kill two hours.
There was really nothing else in the videostore, so I decided to rent
it. Boy, am I glad I did. I really appreciated the movie and related to
it, after all I do go to a Catholic High School. 'The Dangerous Lives
of Altar Boys' is actually a great coming-of-age tale set in the
Catholic school setting of the 1970s. Just by reading the title I
thought it was about pedophile Catholic priests or something, but it's
really about two friends who are the altar boys at their church/school
and their adventures as they discover what's life is all about... or
their interpretation of it.<br><br>The two boys in 'The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' are Francis Doyle
(Emile Hirsch - The Girl Next Door, The Emperor's Club) and Michael
Sullivan (Kieran Culkin - Igby Goes Down, Home Alone). They are two
fifteen year old rebels that have a passion for comics and writing and
illustrating their own. They despise their tough-as-nails and strict
one-legged Catholic nun school teacher, Sister Assumpta (played by Two
Time Academy Award Winner Jodie Foster - The Accused, The Silence of
the Lambs). The two boys make themselves their own creative superheroes
in their comic and have Sister Assumpta be the evil motorcycle peddling
nun from hell that the two superheroes battle, along with the boys'
other two friends who provide superheroes for their comic too. The film
switches from real-life to the creative comic book setting during
conflicts in the story, and I think that it's done very stylish and
neat. The two boys rebel against their teacher and misbehave in front
of her constantly, especially Michael (Culkin) who drives her
absolutely nuts. The boys rebel by doing other things that the nun
doesn't know about like, drink, smoke pot and steal and damage church
property. The film contains some funny moments, and as the story
unfolds Francis (Hirsch) becomes interested in the girl who lives next
door to him Margie (Jena Malone - Saved!, Cold Mountain), a cool, nice,
beautiful and independent girl with a deep and dark secret that
challenges Francis. I won't give it away though.<br><br>There are many great aspects to this film. Most notably is the acting.
Emile Hirsch is nothing short of incredible as the genuine misfit
Francis and Jena Malone is equally as good as the sweet yet complex
Margie. Jodie Foster is hysterical and always a pleasure to watch as
the uptight Catholic school nun and 'Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent's'
Vincent D'Onofrio has a somewhat small role as an interesting Catholic
school priest who smokes like a chimney. The stand-out of the film
however is Kieran Culkin. He is definitely the most talented performer
in his family, and he gives an astounding performance as Michael
Sullivan that puts him on the top of the list of the best child actors
working in Hollywood currently. Culkin gave an equally amazing
performance in Burr Steer's neurotic and darkly hilarious film debut
'Igby Goes Down' which was released the same year as 'The Dangerous
Lives of Altar Boys'. Peter Care does a fabulous job with this, his
feature film debut, and the valley's Todd MacFarlane (creator of Spawn)
provides the comic book illustration for the animated scenes. <br><br>All in all this is a great coming-of-age movie, with a lot of heart and
intelligence. It has some flaws like dragging a little towards the
beginning, being a little unclear towards the end and having some
freaky and unnecessary ghost sequence towards the middle of the film.
I'd recommend this to anyone who attends Catholic High School because
it is a great movie but it's also something you could relate to. Next
time you are at the videostore and can't find anything to watch, maybe
pick up 'The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys'. Chances are you won't
regret it. Grade: B+<br><br>MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #245

The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys is based on the bildungsroman novel
by Chris Furhman, who, unfortunately died of cancer during the revision
of his novel, which was later published by a friend. Judging by the
last chapter (although it is narrated from the first person point of
view of Francis Doyle), I assume that the novel is based on Fuhrman's
own actual childhood experiences and developed into a comic book of the
same title. Unfortunately, while both the novel and the movie are quite
good, the movie lacks some of the structure as well as more
significant, yet ""controversial"" images than does the film (for obvious
reasons on this latter point--they are catering to younger audiences
and pre-teen sex doesn't go over well with your always alert
conservative censors). Likewise, the novel, which is set in Savannah
circa 1970 and deals with heated issues of racism (and our characters
recognition of the fallacies of generalization). It was risqué enough
to develop a movie which contains among its characters a young school
girl who has not only engaged in an incestial relationship, but also
attempted suicide. <br><br>This is the story of four boys in at Blessed Heart, a Catholic School
for Boys. Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch) and Tim Sullivan (Kieran Culkin)
are figures that model Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn (although Francis is
ruled by considerably fewer rules than Tom's Aunt Polly reserved for
her own boy). Tim Sullivan is the inspiration for the gang, living the
credo that danger and trouble is their only defense against boredom.
Partly, their only defense against the absurd rules of society and the
meaningless ritual of adults (our character Tim is of the Holden
Caufield variety), is a comic book (The Atomic Trinity) which the
friends create, which parallels their various coming-of-age experiences
with pranks and first love and so forth. Part of the screen time is
shared with animated scenes of our comic book heroes at work. <br><br>Francis and Tim seem to differ on their goals, however. For Tim, his
goal is the revolt against Sister Assumpta (Jodi Foster) who embodies
most of the absurd rules as head of the Catholic School. For example,
she is the one who confiscates Tim's copy of a book by William Blake (I
think it was called 'The Creation'), and as such, is seen as an unruly
censor. Tim is out to defy that absurdity. His character is the
bildungsromane type more Francis. His character is much smarter, much
more aware of his surroundings. But sadly, it is all he is focused on.
As you see in the comic book scenes, he is the hero who is only
concerned with bringing down the flaming skull, which is actually
Sister Assumpta. Blessed Heart represents everything finds wrong with
the world around him.<br><br>Francis, too, may be disgusted with the hypocrisy of the Catholic
teachings and Blessed Heart in general, but his disgust with the world
and likewise his concern is Margie Flynn (Jena Malone), his first true
love. Flynn is an utterly sad character in a film where you might just
expect boyhood pranks on unsuspecting authority. Flynn is a young quiet
girl who attempted to kill herself because she thought she was going
crazy and hated herself for an incestial relationship she carried on
with her brother. Francis, through his real actions and through his
comic book hero image, tries to rescue the frail Margie Flynn. She is
the girl he is forever in love with, and her frailty may in part be
part of the oppression he sees (like Tim). They don't tell much about
her parents or brother in the movie, but in the novel, they are
divorced and Donnie Flynn is a real sadistic creep, at least towards
Francis and the other boys. <br><br>Margie Flynn is really a difficult character to endure, particularly
for younger audiences, considering the circumstances. The story starts
out like another 'Heaven Help Us' type (only more intellectual and much
funnier) of Catholic School boys run amuck, but the introduction of
Margie's character puts a weird spin about things. I'm not sure that
they developed her character enough for this movie, although much of
the focus within the Flynn-Doyle relationship was on Francis and not
really Margie. Maybe if Emile Hirsch didn't always act so spaced out
all the time, this aspect of the story might've been more effective. <br><br>Meanwhile, when the four boys's comic book is confiscated by Sister
Assumpta, the boys (Tim in particular) get the idea that they're going
to get retaliation on Blessed Heart and, in particular, Sister Assumpta
(amongst all other things that they think need revolting against in
that William Blake revolutionary sense that Tim abides by) by releasing
a panther (in the novel, it was just a bobcat) into the school. By
doing so, they would be declared the local legends of danger. This is
going to be their mark of importance. This is when each of the boys
start questioning their loyalty to this unofficial pact of a crusade
for danger. Francis and Tim (the closet of the four friends), too,
start questioning just how far they're willing to go because, their
idea of importance changes. For Tim, it's all or nothing. For Francis,
he's second guessing just how easy (and necessary) such a prank would
be and also, is meanwhile, wrapped up in his own little world with
Margie Flynn.<br><br>This is one of those coming-of-age films with young characters who have
a heightened sense of self-awareness and such in the style of 'Stand by
Me' and hell, even 'Fandango' and so forth. It's funny and it's sad.
Overall, it's a pretty good movie worth catching. Live dangerously!

Young boys growing up and experiencing life while going to a Catholic school
is a fairly familiar story and when it ends I asked myself if this film had
anything new to offer. It doesn't but there are some effective moments and
performances that keep this from being a total disappointment. Story takes
place in the 1970's at a Catholic school called St. Agatha's and four young
boys are the central characters. Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch) and Tim
Sullivan (Kieran Culkin) are best friends along with Wade (Jake Richardson)
and Joey (Tyler Long) and the four of them pull preposterous pranks against
their school and also collaborate on a comic book story that is called ""The
Atomic Trinity"". At school they are constantly being criticized by Sister
Assumpta (Jodie Foster) who is a very strict nun and one night they decide
to steal a statue from the school and instantly they are suspected of the
crime. Francis starts to date Margie Flynn (Jena Malone) and they get along
very well until she confides in him a very dark secret.<br><br>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br><br>Margie tells Francis that she had an incestuous relationship with her
brother and now he is unsure about how to continue dating her. He asks
Father Casey (Vincent D'Onofrio) for some advice but doesn't get the answer
that he is seeking. Meanwhile, Tim has devised a plan on tranquilizing a
cougar and putting into Sister Assumpta's room but during this prank
something horrible occurs.<br><br>This film is directed by Peter Care who has directed many music video's but
this is his first effort with anything resembling a budget. Care does an
adequate job of telling this story but the script lacks conviction in both
plot and character development. Culkin is the king of all pranks and clearly
doesn't take what is taught to him in school seriously but in one scene
while carrying a dying dog he starts to yell about this animal not being
cared for. This reveals a dark part of his persona but the script never
dwells into it and we are left wondering about this part of him. The part of
the plot about Malone and her brother seems a bit overwrought for the mood
and tone and I never had a sense of what this film was trying to say. A film
like ""American Graffiti"" could balance both comedy and drama but one of the
flaws here is that this film does not do that well at all. Both Hirsch and
Culkin are solid and Malone continues to show great promise but the script
lacks focus with their roles in correlation with the rest of the film.
Foster for the most part plays her part one dimensionally and uninspired and
seems to just go along with what was written for her without developing the
character for her own. The only originality comes from the film balancing
both the live action and the animated sequences and it does a fairly good
job of reflecting their inner most fantasies through their comic book
stories. The films comedy isn't as humorous as ""Heaven Help Us"" and it also
doesn't possess the dark tone and edge of ""The Devil's Playground"". This
film attempts an emotional ending but with the lack of focus and conviction
in the story it doesn't occur.

Group of Catholic schoolboys in the mid-1970s are obsessed with comic
books, girls, and wreaking havoc on their most hated teacher, Sister
Assumpta (Jodie Foster, in a nun's habit, somewhat uneasily cast but
still quite good). A surprisingly rich, rewarding film about
adolescence puts other, more popular films in this genre to shame. The
scruffy, nostalgic era is captured nicely, and the young players really
shine. Spiked with wonderful animated sequences, the film failed to
catch on with its target audience yet is otherwise intelligently
crafted and often very moving. Foster also served as co-producer. ***

""Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"" is very similar to ""Stand By Me,"" with 
the nice addition of a non-stereotyped girl and a stereotyped nun 
(played by producer Jodie Foster) in the mix. 

Young love is shown the sweetest I've seen in a long time (oy, I'm 
still apologizing to a certain boy in my head when he was so sweet to 
me at that age and I didn't know how to handle it; oh well, I didn't 
have a script based on a book to follow.)

Emile Hirsch and Jena Malone are marvelous, especially with the very 
serious sides of their lives, though the lousy parenting is only 
vaguely shown with shouting.

While the gambits of their crew are a bit unbelievable as they try to 
put fantasy into their real lives, their fantasy comic life through 
Todd McFarlane animation is a lot of fun (I was a fan of McFarlane's 
HBO series ""Spawn."") I've never seen a super-hero with such sensitive 
eyes!

""The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"" is one of the best books I've read in
awhile, so I was pretty stoked to see how it translated to film.  The good
news is, this coming-of-age tale (revolving around the themes of first love
and adolescent mischief) remains faithful to its source, while expanding
(successfully, I think) upon what was written in the book.  This worked very
well in Terry Zwigoff's ""Ghost World,"" but there are times in ""The Dangerous

THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS (2002) *** Kieran Culkin, Emile Hirsch,
Jena Malone, Jodie Foster, Vincent D'Onofrio, Jake Richards, Tyler Long. 
Funny and poignant coming of age story centering on two Catholic school
adolescents (Culkin and Hirsch both superb) whose penchant for juvenile acts
of defiance is only underscored by their innate desire to fit in and be
loved while pitted against their arch nemesis, their teacher Sister Assumpta
(a dourly cheeky Foster, who also produced the project), a one-legged
harridan from Hell.  Based on the novel by Chris Fuhrman and written by Jeff
Stockwell and Michael Petroni, the film's strengths in storytelling are in
its dynamic duo of troublemaking loners and are punched up with a wise
peppering of Todd McFarlane's vivid animation depicting the boys' creative
flairs as a Greek chorus to the plotline at hand.  (Dir: Peter Care)

Boys' has been praised for its creativity and the mixed genres, (the
film turns into a Todd McFarlane produced form of anime at times) but
even these moments were just plain boring. Jodie Foster, as always, is
wonderful in the film, but despite the fact that she is supposedly the
evil nemesis, she has an aggregate screen time of perhaps ten minutes,
so there wasn't enough of her to truly enjoy.<br><br>Generally, films that deal with topics such as incest, ghosts, and

effective if done well. (See a film as recent as 'The Virgin Suicides')
Unfortunately 'The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' doesn't come remotely
close to approaching effective, or well done. I expected more out of a

The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys is kind of like a cross between The
Virgin Suicides and Stand By Me. Set in the 70's (featuring many cool
70's haircuts) in small town Georgia, the story focuses on Francis, a
14-year-old dreamer and troublemaker. He and his pals, Tim, Wade, and
Joey cope with life under the oppressive rule of one-legged nun Sister
Assumpta (Jodie Foster) at the Puritan Christian high school they're
unfortunate enough to attend. <br><br>One of their methods of escape is the 'The Atomic Trinity' comic book.
Each of them have their own character with superpowers (such as The
Muscle, Captain Asskicker and Skeleton Boy), battling against the
tyrannical regime of Nunzilla/Pegleg (a gross caricature of Sister
Assumpta). These fantasy stories make up the terrific animated
sequences of the film. The cool thing is that they are not so totally
removed from the reality of Francis, Tim, Wade and Joey.<br><br>The boys soon find their way into a lot of trouble though. After
stealing the school's nun statue mascot the quartet plan to steal a
cougar from the zoo and put in Sister Assumpta's office. A mad plan
yes, but their determination and invention behind it is very clever.<br><br>Some scenes of the film are very emotional, so if you have soft spot
you'll find it tough to get through the scene where Tim finds a dying
dog by the side of the road or Francis reading a poem at the funeral.<br><br>Francis' relationship with Margie (the very cute Jenna Malone) also
takes many curious and unique turns. The scene with the ghost watching
them sleep was pleasingly weird. <br><br>Taken from the one and only book (posthumously) by Chris Fuhrman (a
book I must get as soon as I see), The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys is
attractively shot, wonderfully acted and definitely worth getting.<br><br>The DVD is in 1.85:1 widescreen (strangely non-anamorphic, though the
region 2 version is) with Dolby 5.1 sound and a mild bunch of extras.

In the Seventies, the fifteen years old troublemaker and leader altar
boy Tim Sullivan (Kieran Culkin) and his three great friends, Francis
Doyle (Emile Hirsch), Wade Scalisi (Jake Richardson) and Joey Anderson
(Tyler Long), study in a repressive Catholic school, and they hate
their nun-teacher Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster). Francis has a crush
on Margie Flynn (Jena Malone), who has a dramatic secret in her life.
They like to write a comic book called 'The Atomic Trinity' and all of
them have an alter-ego in their superheroes: Brakken (Francis), The
Muscle/Skeleton Boy later (Tim), Captain Asskicker (Wade) and Major
Screw (Joey), with Sorcerella (Margie) joining them later. Francis uses
to fantasize reality with the fantastic situations the heroes face
against the evil Nunzilla/Pegleg, a dark caricature of Sister Assumpta.
The group plots an evil prank against Sister Assumpta, with tragic
consequences.<br><br>""The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"" is a surprisingly great original
coming to age movie, one of the best I have ever seen in my life. The
group of friends recalled me 1986 ""Stand by Me"" or part of 1981 ""Four
Friends"" and the dramatic situation recalled somehow 1999 ""The Virgin
Suicides"". The screenplay, alternating animation with film, is great:
the boys escape and fantasize reality through their alter egos. The
performance of the young cast is also excellent. Jodie Foster, as the
severe teacher, and Vincent D'Onofrio, as Father Casey, magnificently
complete this wonderful cast. I could never imagine Jodie Foster in
such role. I highly recommend this great movie, much unknown here in
Brazil. My vote is nine.<br><br>Title (Brazil): ""Meninos de Deus"" (""Boys of God"")

I came across this indie gem one day at my local Blockbuster. I looked
at it and it seemed like it would be an o.k. way to kill two hours.
There was really nothing else in the videostore, so I decided to rent
it. Boy, am I glad I did. I really appreciated the movie and related to
it, after all I do go to a Catholic High School. 'The Dangerous Lives
of Altar Boys' is actually a great coming-of-age tale set in the
Catholic school setting of the 1970s. Just by reading the title I
thought it was about pedophile Catholic priests or something, but it's
really about two friends who are the altar boys at their church/school
and their adventures as they discover what's life is all about... or
their interpretation of it.<br><br>The two boys in 'The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' are Francis Doyle
(Emile Hirsch - The Girl Next Door, The Emperor's Club) and Michael
Sullivan (Kieran Culkin - Igby Goes Down, Home Alone). They are two
fifteen year old rebels that have a passion for comics and writing and
illustrating their own. They despise their tough-as-nails and strict
one-legged Catholic nun school teacher, Sister Assumpta (played by Two
Time Academy Award Winner Jodie Foster - The Accused, The Silence of
the Lambs). The two boys make themselves their own creative superheroes
in their comic and have Sister Assumpta be the evil motorcycle peddling
nun from hell that the two superheroes battle, along with the boys'
other two friends who provide superheroes for their comic too. The film
switches from real-life to the creative comic book setting during
conflicts in the story, and I think that it's done very stylish and
neat. The two boys rebel against their teacher and misbehave in front
of her constantly, especially Michael (Culkin) who drives her
absolutely nuts. The boys rebel by doing other things that the nun
doesn't know about like, drink, smoke pot and steal and damage church
property. The film contains some funny moments, and as the story
unfolds Francis (Hirsch) becomes interested in the girl who lives next
door to him Margie (Jena Malone - Saved!, Cold Mountain), a cool, nice,
beautiful and independent girl with a deep and dark secret that
challenges Francis. I won't give it away though.<br><br>There are many great aspects to this film. Most notably is the acting.
Emile Hirsch is nothing short of incredible as the genuine misfit
Francis and Jena Malone is equally as good as the sweet yet complex
Margie. Jodie Foster is hysterical and always a pleasure to watch as
the uptight Catholic school nun and 'Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent's'
Vincent D'Onofrio has a somewhat small role as an interesting Catholic
school priest who smokes like a chimney. The stand-out of the film
however is Kieran Culkin. He is definitely the most talented performer
in his family, and he gives an astounding performance as Michael
Sullivan that puts him on the top of the list of the best child actors
working in Hollywood currently. Culkin gave an equally amazing
performance in Burr Steer's neurotic and darkly hilarious film debut
'Igby Goes Down' which was released the same year as 'The Dangerous
Lives of Altar Boys'. Peter Care does a fabulous job with this, his
feature film debut, and the valley's Todd MacFarlane (creator of Spawn)
provides the comic book illustration for the animated scenes. <br><br>All in all this is a great coming-of-age movie, with a lot of heart and
intelligence. It has some flaws like dragging a little towards the
beginning, being a little unclear towards the end and having some
freaky and unnecessary ghost sequence towards the middle of the film.
I'd recommend this to anyone who attends Catholic High School because
it is a great movie but it's also something you could relate to. Next
time you are at the videostore and can't find anything to watch, maybe
pick up 'The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys'. Chances are you won't
regret it. Grade: B+<br><br>MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #245

The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys is based on the bildungsroman novel
by Chris Furhman, who, unfortunately died of cancer during the revision
of his novel, which was later published by a friend. Judging by the
last chapter (although it is narrated from the first person point of
view of Francis Doyle), I assume that the novel is based on Fuhrman's
own actual childhood experiences and developed into a comic book of the
same title. Unfortunately, while both the novel and the movie are quite
good, the movie lacks some of the structure as well as more
significant, yet ""controversial"" images than does the film (for obvious
reasons on this latter point--they are catering to younger audiences
and pre-teen sex doesn't go over well with your always alert
conservative censors). Likewise, the novel, which is set in Savannah
circa 1970 and deals with heated issues of racism (and our characters
recognition of the fallacies of generalization). It was risqué enough
to develop a movie which contains among its characters a young school
girl who has not only engaged in an incestial relationship, but also
attempted suicide. <br><br>This is the story of four boys in at Blessed Heart, a Catholic School
for Boys. Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch) and Tim Sullivan (Kieran Culkin)
are figures that model Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn (although Francis is
ruled by considerably fewer rules than Tom's Aunt Polly reserved for
her own boy). Tim Sullivan is the inspiration for the gang, living the
credo that danger and trouble is their only defense against boredom.
Partly, their only defense against the absurd rules of society and the
meaningless ritual of adults (our character Tim is of the Holden
Caufield variety), is a comic book (The Atomic Trinity) which the
friends create, which parallels their various coming-of-age experiences
with pranks and first love and so forth. Part of the screen time is
shared with animated scenes of our comic book heroes at work. <br><br>Francis and Tim seem to differ on their goals, however. For Tim, his
goal is the revolt against Sister Assumpta (Jodi Foster) who embodies
most of the absurd rules as head of the Catholic School. For example,
she is the one who confiscates Tim's copy of a book by William Blake (I
think it was called 'The Creation'), and as such, is seen as an unruly
censor. Tim is out to defy that absurdity. His character is the
bildungsromane type more Francis. His character is much smarter, much
more aware of his surroundings. But sadly, it is all he is focused on.
As you see in the comic book scenes, he is the hero who is only
concerned with bringing down the flaming skull, which is actually
Sister Assumpta. Blessed Heart represents everything finds wrong with
the world around him.<br><br>Francis, too, may be disgusted with the hypocrisy of the Catholic
teachings and Blessed Heart in general, but his disgust with the world
and likewise his concern is Margie Flynn (Jena Malone), his first true
love. Flynn is an utterly sad character in a film where you might just
expect boyhood pranks on unsuspecting authority. Flynn is a young quiet
girl who attempted to kill herself because she thought she was going
crazy and hated herself for an incestial relationship she carried on
with her brother. Francis, through his real actions and through his
comic book hero image, tries to rescue the frail Margie Flynn. She is
the girl he is forever in love with, and her frailty may in part be
part of the oppression he sees (like Tim). They don't tell much about
her parents or brother in the movie, but in the novel, they are
divorced and Donnie Flynn is a real sadistic creep, at least towards
Francis and the other boys. <br><br>Margie Flynn is really a difficult character to endure, particularly
for younger audiences, considering the circumstances. The story starts
out like another 'Heaven Help Us' type (only more intellectual and much
funnier) of Catholic School boys run amuck, but the introduction of
Margie's character puts a weird spin about things. I'm not sure that
they developed her character enough for this movie, although much of
the focus within the Flynn-Doyle relationship was on Francis and not
really Margie. Maybe if Emile Hirsch didn't always act so spaced out
all the time, this aspect of the story might've been more effective. <br><br>Meanwhile, when the four boys's comic book is confiscated by Sister
Assumpta, the boys (Tim in particular) get the idea that they're going
to get retaliation on Blessed Heart and, in particular, Sister Assumpta
(amongst all other things that they think need revolting against in
that William Blake revolutionary sense that Tim abides by) by releasing
a panther (in the novel, it was just a bobcat) into the school. By
doing so, they would be declared the local legends of danger. This is
going to be their mark of importance. This is when each of the boys
start questioning their loyalty to this unofficial pact of a crusade
for danger. Francis and Tim (the closet of the four friends), too,
start questioning just how far they're willing to go because, their
idea of importance changes. For Tim, it's all or nothing. For Francis,
he's second guessing just how easy (and necessary) such a prank would
be and also, is meanwhile, wrapped up in his own little world with
Margie Flynn.<br><br>This is one of those coming-of-age films with young characters who have
a heightened sense of self-awareness and such in the style of 'Stand by
Me' and hell, even 'Fandango' and so forth. It's funny and it's sad.
Overall, it's a pretty good movie worth catching. Live dangerously!

Young boys growing up and experiencing life while going to a Catholic school
is a fairly familiar story and when it ends I asked myself if this film had
anything new to offer. It doesn't but there are some effective moments and
performances that keep this from being a total disappointment. Story takes
place in the 1970's at a Catholic school called St. Agatha's and four young
boys are the central characters. Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch) and Tim
Sullivan (Kieran Culkin) are best friends along with Wade (Jake Richardson)
and Joey (Tyler Long) and the four of them pull preposterous pranks against
their school and also collaborate on a comic book story that is called ""The
Atomic Trinity"". At school they are constantly being criticized by Sister
Assumpta (Jodie Foster) who is a very strict nun and one night they decide
to steal a statue from the school and instantly they are suspected of the
crime. Francis starts to date Margie Flynn (Jena Malone) and they get along
very well until she confides in him a very dark secret.<br><br>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br><br>Margie tells Francis that she had an incestuous relationship with her
brother and now he is unsure about how to continue dating her. He asks
Father Casey (Vincent D'Onofrio) for some advice but doesn't get the answer
that he is seeking. Meanwhile, Tim has devised a plan on tranquilizing a
cougar and putting into Sister Assumpta's room but during this prank
something horrible occurs.<br><br>This film is directed by Peter Care who has directed many music video's but
this is his first effort with anything resembling a budget. Care does an
adequate job of telling this story but the script lacks conviction in both
plot and character development. Culkin is the king of all pranks and clearly
doesn't take what is taught to him in school seriously but in one scene
while carrying a dying dog he starts to yell about this animal not being
cared for. This reveals a dark part of his persona but the script never
dwells into it and we are left wondering about this part of him. The part of
the plot about Malone and her brother seems a bit overwrought for the mood
and tone and I never had a sense of what this film was trying to say. A film
like ""American Graffiti"" could balance both comedy and drama but one of the
flaws here is that this film does not do that well at all. Both Hirsch and
Culkin are solid and Malone continues to show great promise but the script
lacks focus with their roles in correlation with the rest of the film.
Foster for the most part plays her part one dimensionally and uninspired and
seems to just go along with what was written for her without developing the
character for her own. The only originality comes from the film balancing
both the live action and the animated sequences and it does a fairly good
job of reflecting their inner most fantasies through their comic book
stories. The films comedy isn't as humorous as ""Heaven Help Us"" and it also
doesn't possess the dark tone and edge of ""The Devil's Playground"". This
film attempts an emotional ending but with the lack of focus and conviction
in the story it doesn't occur.

Group of Catholic schoolboys in the mid-1970s are obsessed with comic
books, girls, and wreaking havoc on their most hated teacher, Sister
Assumpta (Jodie Foster, in a nun's habit, somewhat uneasily cast but
still quite good). A surprisingly rich, rewarding film about
adolescence puts other, more popular films in this genre to shame. The
scruffy, nostalgic era is captured nicely, and the young players really
shine. Spiked with wonderful animated sequences, the film failed to
catch on with its target audience yet is otherwise intelligently
crafted and often very moving. Foster also served as co-producer. ***

""Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"" is very similar to ""Stand By Me,"" with 
the nice addition of a non-stereotyped girl and a stereotyped nun 
(played by producer Jodie Foster) in the mix. 

Young love is shown the sweetest I've seen in a long time (oy, I'm 
still apologizing to a certain boy in my head when he was so sweet to 
me at that age and I didn't know how to handle it; oh well, I didn't 
have a script based on a book to follow.)

Emile Hirsch and Jena Malone are marvelous, especially with the very 
serious sides of their lives, though the lousy parenting is only 
vaguely shown with shouting.

While the gambits of their crew are a bit unbelievable as they try to 
put fantasy into their real lives, their fantasy comic life through 
Todd McFarlane animation is a lot of fun (I was a fan of McFarlane's

eyes!

""The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"" is one of the best books I've read in
awhile, so I was pretty stoked to see how it translated to film.  The good
news is, this coming-of-age tale (revolving around the themes of first love
and adolescent mischief) remains faithful to its source, while expanding
(successfully, I think) upon what was written in the book.  This worked very
well in Terry Zwigoff's ""Ghost World,"" but there are times in ""The Dangerous

flat-out drama, to flat-out comedy.  It always manages to regain its

His mother, Jean Wilson (Holm), was as a nurse, and his father, Doctor James Harvey Cuthbert, was a psychiatrist. Young Holm was brought up in London. At the age of seven he was inspired by the seeing \'Les Miserables\' and became fond of acting. Holm studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, graduating in 1950 to the Royal Shakespeare Company. There he emerged as an actor whose range and effortless style allowed him to play almost entire Shakespeare\'s repertoire. In 1959 his stage partner Laurence Olivier scored a hit on Ian Holm in a sword fight in a production of \'Coriolanus\'. Holm still has a scar on his finger.In 1965 Holm made his debut on television as Richard III on the BBC\'s The Wars of the Roses (1965), which was a filmed theatrical production of four of Shakespeare\'s plays condensed down into a trilogy. In 1969 Holm won his first BAFTA Film Award Best Supporting Actor for The Bofors Gun (1968), then followed a flow of awards and nominations for his numerous works in film and on television.

In 1821, on St. Helena, Napoleon loyalists switch the emperor with a

more on the mannerisms than the script.  Yet the best lines are good, such
as when the emperor, disguised as a seaman, boards a ship and says, ""A

interest, Pumpkin, responds after he tells her his true identity: ""You're
not Napoleon! I hate Napoleon! He has filled France with widows and orphans!
He took my husband. I won't let him take you."" There are truths there to
make a revolution.<br><br>Our hero tries his hand at selling melons, marshalling his crew with his
great leadership rhetoric, and wins the love of Pumpkin, her son, and
himself after 6 years of humiliating, loveless exile.<br><br>When the film opens with the young son showing colored slides of the

warmth for the rest of the film.  When you wake with Napoleon on ship to see
a stunning sunrise, you know Alessio Gelsini Torresi is a cinematographer
worth watching.<br><br>This sweet film, softly extolling the grandeur of simple love, takes it

""The Emporer's New Clothes"" is a revisionist historical romantic comedy
which tells of Napoleon Bonaparte's escape from exile on  St. Helena and
return to France to reclaim his throne. Traveling incognito,  Bonaparte
(Holm) hooks up with a comely widow Pumpkin (Hjejle) who takes some of the
starch out of the ""Little Corporal's"" skivvies while setting his crusty
old
heart aglow. A charming period piece with exotic locations, this film
pairs
a tour de force by Holm with an all too rare performance by versatile
beauty
(Hjejle) in a happy mix of drama, subtle comedy, and light hearted
romance.

Magical arthouse gem (released here on Paramount's ""Classic"" label)
which
deserves a wider release...and rescue from the curse of small theater
presentation...(I saw it improperley masked on a tiny screen which
appeared
to have a very vociferous nest of fledglings behind it...and the film
still
glowed...my first raves have to be for the superb photography and inspired
digital wizardy which made the audience's journey back to 1821 so
enchantingly real).  Very clever and charming script manages to manipulate
the myths, legends, and cliches surrounding Historys favorite mini
meglomaniac and find a spark of humanity missing from most movie
representations (except for Abel Gance's masterpiece...which is
beautifully
saluted in this movie's final snowy scene).  Ian Holm sinks into the role
of
the exciled emperor and the burlesque turn of the galley swabber recruited
to impersonate him with equal aplomp...(to be honest I would have relished
a
bit more of the impersonators delicious descent into debauchery).
Excellent
supporting performances, beautiful score, and unique unsentimental
portrait
of the period (with unvarnished representations of 1820's undertaking,
hygine, and nontreatment of mental illness).  A film to treasure if just
for
the gentle subtlety of it's central romance...including a tryst on a
rooftop
overlooking Paris during a thunderstorm which ranks as one of the
loveliest
shots in years.  A sweet smart little gem which belongs in the collection
of
every cinema connosuire

A big measure of how I rate a movie comes from how I feel at the end
of
it. I was feeling really good after this one.<br><br>Quick plot outline: Napoleon (an awesome Ian Holm)
is exiled on the isle of St. Helena, but
someone has been found who looks exactly like him. So he
has
concocted a simple plan: have him and the look-alike switch
places,
and then after Napoleon arrives in Paris, have the fake announce
to
the world that he is a fraud, in essence telling the world
Napoleon
has escaped and therefore paving the way for Napoleon to return to
the
throne. But the plan doesn't go as predicted: the ship Napoleon travels
on
sails by France for one, and the fraud is not quick to give up his
oh-so
dreary exile. When Napoleon does arrive in Paris, as per the
plan,
he stays with Madame Truchaut, the wife (Iben Hjejle) of a now
deceased
soldier who had started a fruit-selling business after his military
career
had ended. Napoleon and Madame Truchaut get to know each other and
her
kindness begins to chip away at his hardened heart. Needless to say
while
this is happening, the fake is not quick to tell to the world he is
an
impostor as he's been cleaning the poop decks of Napoleon's ships
for
years. And the real Napoleon begins to see the real cost that his
reign
cost France.<br><br>The basic story is not new but it is done really well. Ian Holm is a
VERY
believable Napoleon, always walking like a soldier, talking
in a straight and curt manner, and in general giving the
impression
he was born in a war room. He's also quite funny as Eugene
Lenormand,
the fake who's playing Napoleon. The film could have easily
been
a flop - mixing a love story with Napoleon is obviously a sticky wicket.
But
it doesn't get too serious for it's own good, or too funny. It's a
great
mix. The film doesn't spend too much time on the fake, which it
easily
could have for laughs. The story is about the real Napoleon, and it
stays
focused. There is also a great scene where a rival for
Madame
Truchaut's affections, a doctor (an unctuous Tim McInnerny),
tricks
Napoleon into coming to a mental institution, where Napoleon
sees
a whole bunch of crazies pretending to be him. He looks at himself:
is
this the legacy he left France? Is he looking at himself and not liking
what
he sees? It's a cool scene. It makes it all the more powerful as
the
doctor knows his identity, and seems to get a twisted yet
humbling satisfaction from humiliating and defeating the great
Napoleon,
not to mention freeing up Madame Truchaut for himself.<br><br>But I was still smiling a lot through the movie, and that's something
I
don't find a lot these days. Maybe you will too. Highly
recommended.

First off I need to say that Ian Hom is amazing. To be able to play two
different characters of two different persuasions and bearings is
mind-blowing. This film is whimsical and fun and a very good ""what if""
of history. Parts of it are sad and parts are humorous and all of it is
good. A human element is given to characters whom are known to history
solely for their deeds and every character in the film has depth of
field and a real personality. Many of the scenes are played out in
textbook fashion with a beginning a middle and an end with rising and
falling action and yet each scene propels the story line further and is
a driving force to the film as a whole. My personal favorite moment in
the film is the melon scene where Naploean as an exile in his own
country still becomes a general of a an army of melon merchants. Sheer
brilliance and very beautiful in its humanity. This film shows that
although a person can't change whop they are, everyone can change
direction and find love.

so
much I'd like to say about the film, but I don't want to give anything
away
since the film won't be out until later this Spring.<br><br>Run out to see this film if you crave a feel good movie that's

not sappy, and simply fun to watch. I have not been this satisfied with
the
ending of a film in ages. We talked about the film all the way home. By
the

In 1821, on St. Helena, Napoleon loyalists switch the emperor with a
look-alike ship hand and send the little tyrant secretly off to Paris to
revive the Old Order. I love improbable movies like `The Emperor's New
Clothes,' especially the docudramas that feed our lust to know the insides
of great figures.<br><br>You may not know Ian Holm's Napoleon that well because Holm concentrates
more on the mannerisms than the script.  Yet the best lines are good, such
as when the emperor, disguised as a seaman, boards a ship and says, ""A
position above decks would have been more appropriate.' Or when his love
interest, Pumpkin, responds after he tells her his true identity: ""You're
not Napoleon! I hate Napoleon! He has filled France with widows and orphans!
He took my husband. I won't let him take you."" There are truths there to
make a revolution.<br><br>Our hero tries his hand at selling melons, marshalling his crew with his
great leadership rhetoric, and wins the love of Pumpkin, her son, and
himself after 6 years of humiliating, loveless exile.<br><br>When the film opens with the young son showing colored slides of the
emperor's life on a primitive projector, you can feel the romance and the
warmth for the rest of the film.  When you wake with Napoleon on ship to see
a stunning sunrise, you know Alessio Gelsini Torresi is a cinematographer
worth watching.<br><br>This sweet film, softly extolling the grandeur of simple love, takes it
final cue from Candide, where that weary traveler laid his weary heart in
his garden.  This Napoleon had said,  ""I place my trust in only two things:
my will and the love of the people of France."" He finds now a redemptive
will to survive and, without egotism or violence, a love of one person to
satisfy an empire.<br><br>This is good old-fashioned romance, history, and fiction all in one small
but unforgettable film, a bit like the subject himself.<br><br> <br><br>

I watched the first screening of 'The Emperor's New Clothes' at the
London Film Festival. The film seemed to disappear from the public eye
after that, even though I personally thought that it was a good film.<br><br>In summary, this film is about Napoleon who wants to get his lost power
back, and he pretends he is a peasant in order to eventually rise up
and seize it. During this time, he meets a woman he falls in love with.
The film explores how his life evolves over the longing of love and
power, and there is the realization that he cannot achieve both.<br><br>This film is moving and witty. One of the most memorable scenes was
when Napoleon tries to convince others that he is Napoleon, but he is
not believed, and they take him to an asylum where there are many
others there that believe that they are Napoleon.<br><br>I was surprised that this film did not get respected; it is a forgotten
gem.

This is a carefully crafted, beautifully acted ""what if"" story about
Napoleon Bonaparte. It is literate, inventive, and has a beautiful
music score to boot. The female lead, Iben Hjejle, is a revelation! I
wish she would make more films outside of Denmark.<br><br>The story centers around Napoleon's exile after Waterloo, and a plot to
have him escape (using a double), return to France to raise an army and
regain his throne. But something unforeseen happens along the way, when
his double, back on St. Helena, decides he is enjoying being Emperor
Napoleon too much to give it up. That leaves the real Emperor Napoleon,
secretly back in Paris, with a problem: nobody believes he is who he
says he is...<br><br>Let's not reveal any more of the plot in this outstanding film
(provided you can enjoy a movie with no nudity and cursing, and
virtually no violence).

""The Emporer's New Clothes"" is a revisionist historical romantic comedy
which tells of Napoleon Bonaparte's escape from exile on  St. Helena and
return to France to reclaim his throne. Traveling incognito,  Bonaparte
(Holm) hooks up with a comely widow Pumpkin (Hjejle) who takes some of the
starch out of the ""Little Corporal's"" skivvies while setting his crusty
old
heart aglow. A charming period piece with exotic locations, this film
pairs
a tour de force by Holm with an all too rare performance by versatile
beauty
(Hjejle) in a happy mix of drama, subtle comedy, and light hearted
romance.

Magical arthouse gem (released here on Paramount's ""Classic"" label)
which
deserves a wider release...and rescue from the curse of small theater
presentation...(I saw it improperley masked on a tiny screen which
appeared
to have a very vociferous nest of fledglings behind it...and the film
still
glowed...my first raves have to be for the superb photography and inspired
digital wizardy which made the audience's journey back to 1821 so
enchantingly real).  Very clever and charming script manages to manipulate
the myths, legends, and cliches surrounding Historys favorite mini
meglomaniac and find a spark of humanity missing from most movie
representations (except for Abel Gance's masterpiece...which is
beautifully
saluted in this movie's final snowy scene).  Ian Holm sinks into the role
of
the exciled emperor and the burlesque turn of the galley swabber recruited
to impersonate him with equal aplomp...(to be honest I would have relished
a
bit more of the impersonators delicious descent into debauchery).
Excellent
supporting performances, beautiful score, and unique unsentimental
portrait
of the period (with unvarnished representations of 1820's undertaking,
hygine, and nontreatment of mental illness).  A film to treasure if just
for
the gentle subtlety of it's central romance...including a tryst on a
rooftop
overlooking Paris during a thunderstorm which ranks as one of the
loveliest
shots in years.  A sweet smart little gem which belongs in the collection
of
every cinema connosuire

A big measure of how I rate a movie comes from how I feel at the end
of
it. I was feeling really good after this one.<br><br>Quick plot outline: Napoleon (an awesome Ian Holm)
is exiled on the isle of St. Helena, but
someone has been found who looks exactly like him. So he
has
concocted a simple plan: have him and the look-alike switch
places,
and then after Napoleon arrives in Paris, have the fake announce
to
the world that he is a fraud, in essence telling the world
Napoleon
has escaped and therefore paving the way for Napoleon to return to
the
throne. But the plan doesn't go as predicted: the ship Napoleon travels
on
sails by France for one, and the fraud is not quick to give up his
oh-so
dreary exile. When Napoleon does arrive in Paris, as per the
plan,
he stays with Madame Truchaut, the wife (Iben Hjejle) of a now
deceased
soldier who had started a fruit-selling business after his military
career
had ended. Napoleon and Madame Truchaut get to know each other and
her
kindness begins to chip away at his hardened heart. Needless to say
while
this is happening, the fake is not quick to tell to the world he is
an
impostor as he's been cleaning the poop decks of Napoleon's ships
for
years. And the real Napoleon begins to see the real cost that his
reign
cost France.<br><br>The basic story is not new but it is done really well. Ian Holm is a
VERY
believable Napoleon, always walking like a soldier, talking
in a straight and curt manner, and in general giving the
impression
he was born in a war room. He's also quite funny as Eugene
Lenormand,
the fake who's playing Napoleon. The film could have easily
been
a flop - mixing a love story with Napoleon is obviously a sticky wicket.
But
it doesn't get too serious for it's own good, or too funny. It's a
great
mix. The film doesn't spend too much time on the fake, which it
easily
could have for laughs. The story is about the real Napoleon, and it
stays
focused. There is also a great scene where a rival for
Madame
Truchaut's affections, a doctor (an unctuous Tim McInnerny),
tricks
Napoleon into coming to a mental institution, where Napoleon
sees
a whole bunch of crazies pretending to be him. He looks at himself:
is
this the legacy he left France? Is he looking at himself and not liking
what
he sees? It's a cool scene. It makes it all the more powerful as
the
doctor knows his identity, and seems to get a twisted yet
humbling satisfaction from humiliating and defeating the great
Napoleon,
not to mention freeing up Madame Truchaut for himself.<br><br>But I was still smiling a lot through the movie, and that's something
I
don't find a lot these days. Maybe you will too. Highly
recommended.

First off I need to say that Ian Hom is amazing. To be able to play two
different characters of two different persuasions and bearings is
mind-blowing. This film is whimsical and fun and a very good ""what if""
of history. Parts of it are sad and parts are humorous and all of it is
good. A human element is given to characters whom are known to history
solely for their deeds and every character in the film has depth of
field and a real personality. Many of the scenes are played out in
textbook fashion with a beginning a middle and an end with rising and
falling action and yet each scene propels the story line further and is
a driving force to the film as a whole. My personal favorite moment in
the film is the melon scene where Naploean as an exile in his own
country still becomes a general of a an army of melon merchants. Sheer
brilliance and very beautiful in its humanity. This film shows that
although a person can't change whop they are, everyone can change
direction and find love.

This movie was outstanding!  A neat little conspiracy theory about the
true
last years of Napoleon Bonaparte.  Ian Holm is fantastic as both Napoleon
and Lenormand.  The military strategy of watermelons is hilarious.  If you
missed this in the the theaters, you've got to rent it!

I probably would not have seen this movie if not for the rave reviews I
read
here.  There were so many positive comments, it seemed I couldn't go
wrong.
You were all correct.<br><br>Thanks to everyone who reviewed this film.  It was absolutely superb!
The

I had the pleasure of seeing The Emperor's New Clothes. What a treat. The
story was delightful, the cast sublime, the cinematography glorious, and
the
soundtrack one I would like to purchase...so, you can tell I loved
everything about the film. The story is a lovely fairy tale and the best
I've seen since the ""Princess Bride.""<br><br>Ian Holm plays Napoleon and is perfect, as are all his co-stars. There is
so
much I'd like to say about the film, but I don't want to give anything
away
since the film won't be out until later this Spring.<br><br>Run out to see this film if you crave a feel good movie that's
intelligent,
not sappy, and simply fun to watch. I have not been this satisfied with
the
ending of a film in ages. We talked about the film all the way home. By
the
way, the entire audience gave it a solid round of applause as the lights
came up. That should say it all.<br><br>I sense some Oscar nods for this film in 2003. It's a hit.

A middle-aged crime boss smugly reflects back from 1999, narrating the brutality which made him triumphant - and feared. As an unnamed young hood in Swinging 60's London, he aped his mod boss Freddie Mays, and seemed to do anything for him. But his narration exposes all-consuming envy: of Freddie's supremacy, and especially his tall bird.

His father was an alcoholic. Malcolm hated his parents\' ways. His father was keen to send his son to private school to give him a good start in life, so Malcolm was packed off to boarding school at age 11. He attended the Tunbridge Boarding School and the Cannock House School in Eltham, Kent. At school, he was beaten with the slipper or cane every Monday for his wayward behavior. Whilst at school, he decided that he wanted to become an actor; it was also around this time that his love for race cars began. He attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts (LAMDA) to study acting. Meanwhile, he worked at his parents\' pub but lost his job when the pub went bankrupt, his father drinking all the profits. He then had a variety of jobs, from coffee salesman to messenger.His first big-screen role was in Poor Cow (1967), although his two-minute scene was ultimately cut from the completed film. Soon after, he caught the attention of director Lindsay Anderson who cast him in the role of a rebellious student in his film If.... (1968). The film catapulted Malcolm to stardom in Britain but failed everywhere else. He was so enthusiastic about the film\'s success that he wanted to do another right away. He began writing what would become the semi-autobiographical O Lucky Man! (1973). Meanwhile, he starred as the infamous Alex DeLarge in Stanley Kubrick\'s controversial A Clockwork Orange (1971), a role that caused him to be typecast as a manic psychopathic villain. In early 1976, he spent nearly a year working on what would later be one of the most infamous films of all time, the semi-pornographic Caligola (1979), financed by Penthouse magazine founder Bob Guccione. Around that time, the British film industry collapsed, forcing him to flee to America to continue working. His first American film was Time After Time (1979). He then did Britannia Hospital (1982), the last part of Lindsay Anderson\'s working-class trilogy that started with If.... (1968).In the mid-1980s, the years of alcohol and drug abuse, including $1000 a week on cocaine, caught up with him. Years of abuse took its toll on him; his black hairs were now grey. Looking older than he really was, nobody wanted to cast him for playing younger roles. The big roles having dried up, he did many B-rated movies. The 1990s were kinder to him, though. In 1994, he was cast as Dr. Tolian Soran, the man who killed Captain James T. Kirk in Star Trek: Generations (1994). He was back on the track, playing villains again. He played another in the classic BBC miniseries Our Friends in the North (1996). Today, with more than 100 films under his belt, he is one of the greatest actors in America. He still does not have American citizenship, but he likes the no-nonsense American ways. He resides in the northern suburbs of Los Angeles, California.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Pedro Borges          Spouse (3) Kelley McDowell (12 November\xa01991            - present)\xa0(3 children)           Mary Steenburgen (29 September\xa01980            - 1 October\xa01990)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(2 children)           Margot Bennett (21 April\xa01975            - 15 September\xa01980)\xa0(divorced)          Trade Mark (6)        Raspy deep-throated voice        Often plays immoral characters or outright villains        Often plays authority figures        Characters who are often fiendishly intelligent and ruthless        Broad bulbous nose and dark blue eyes        Known for his bombastic and intentionally antagonistic personality (especially in his relationship with many directors)Trivia (65)      His first wife, Margot Bennett, was Keir Dullea\'s ex-wife. Keir was the main character in Stanley Kubrick\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), while McDowell was the main character in Kubrick\'s next film, A Clockwork Orange (1971).      Father of Lilly McDowell and Charlie McDowell. Uncle of Alexander Siddig.      Along with Sir John Gielgud, he is one of only two actors to play both King Arthur and Merlin. He played King Arthur in Arthur the King (1985) and Merlin in Kids of the Round Table (1995).      13 of his films were shown at retrospective tribute at New York City\'s Walter Reade Theatre, where he introduces the least known of these, The Connection (1961). [May 2002]      Has said that his favorite actor of all time is James Cagney.      Claims Gangster No. 1 (2000) to be his best work since A Clockwork Orange (1971).      Was the first well-known actor to appear non-animated and in the flesh for South Park (1997) because he is one of Trey Parker\'s favorite actors and he was specifically requested.      Has appeared in four films involving time travel: Time After Time (1979), Star Trek: Generations (1994), Just Visiting (2001) and The Philadelphia Experiment (2012). He auditioned for the role of Al Calavicci on the television series Quantum Leap (1989), which would have made 5 times. There was a character in Quantum Leap: A Leap for Lisa - June 25, 1957 (1992) played by Roddy McDowall, who was not related (notice the difference in spelling of the last names).      His performance as Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange (1971) was ranked 100 on the list of the ""100 Greatest Film Performances of All Time"" and was ranked 68 on Premiere magazine\'s ""100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time"".      Lives in Santa Barbara, California.      Owns another home in Britain and a summer retreat in Tuscany.      Good friends with Christine Noonan and David Sherwin.      Was captain of the rugby and cricket teams at his high school.      As he wanted to get into the SAG, he took his mother\'s maiden name McDowell because there was another British actor called Malcolm Taylor.      Born to Charles Taylor, a publican, and his wife Edna McDowell, a hotelier, he grew up with two sisters: Gloria (older) and Judy (younger).      His job as a coffee salesman provided inspiration for O Lucky Man! (1973).      In an interview, he said that a magazine named him ""King of Punk"" after his appearance in A Clockwork Orange (1971). This is probably because of the punk references that appears in the movie, such as the droogies costume style.      Has been friends with Aubrey Morris ever since they worked together in A Clockwork Orange (1971).      Trained as an actor at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) in London, England.      Has three sons with his wife Kelley McDowell: Beckett Taylor McDowell (born January 29, 2004), Finnian Anderson McDowell (born December 23, 2006) and Seamus Hudson McDowell (born January 7, 2009).      When he went to meet with Stanley Kubrick for the first time, he had little knowledge of film and confused him with Stanley Kramer. In preparation, McDowell\'s friend and mentor, Lindsay Anderson, showed him all of Kubrick\'s films from Paths of Glory (1957) to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).      As a schoolboy, Malcolm was so bored having to listen to long, tedious speeches by minor local dignitaries at official school functions, when he became a star, he took his revenge. Asked to give the keynote speech at Cannock School\'s annual Open Day in 1969, he flew all the way from the United States to attend. Before a packed assembly, he simply announced ""I hereby pronounce this Open Day open"" and sat down.      Has a fear of reptiles. When Stanley Kubrick learned this while shooting A Clockwork Orange (1971), he introduced Basil, Alex\'s pet snake.      Is 24 years older than his wife Kelley McDowell.      As he wanted to get into the British Actors\' Equity, he took his mother\'s maiden name McDowell because there was another British actor called Malcolm Taylor.      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6714 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on March 16, 2012.      On September 25, 2012, he was rushed to the hospital and had to undergo a 3 1/2 hour emergency surgery on his eye, for what was discovered to be a detached retina.      Granddaughter Clementine Mae Watson was born January 2012. Her mother is Malcolm\'s daughter Lilly McDowell Watson.      Has appeared in a scene in A Clockwork Orange (1971) with David Prowse, who played Darth Vader in Star Wars. In 2014, he appeared in a cellular telephone commercial with James Earl Jones, who provided Darth Vader\'s voice. McDowell also appeared in Robot Chicken: Star Wars (2007).      Has appeared in a South Park (1997) parody of Charles Dickens\' ""Great Expectations"", playing a British Person (2000).      Received death threats from overzealous Star Trek fans after his character Dr. Tolian Soren killed Captain James T. Kirk in Star Trek: Generations (1994).      He listened to recordings of H.G. Wells to prepare for the role in Time After Time (1979). According to McDowell, Wells\' voice was high-pitched and Cockney-accented so he decided not to imitate his voice.      Despite the fact that they played enemies in Blue Thunder (1983), both Roy Scheider and McDowell became very good friends during the production. As he would later state at various science fiction conventions, they enjoyed working together so much, that they could not leave each other alone. After Scheider passed away, a very saddened McDowell was unable to attend Scheider\'s funeral because of a film commitment that he could not get away from (much to his dismay). As a result, he immediately ordered flowers and sent a letter of condolence to Scheider\'s family.      He has two roles in common with his Time After Time (1979) co-star David Warner: (1) McDowell played Admiral Geoffrey Tolwyn in Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger (1994), Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom (1996) and Wing Commander Academy (1996) while Warner played him in Wing Commander (1999) and (2) McDowell played Professor Abraham Van Helsing in Suck (2009) while Warner played him in Penny Dreadful (2014).      He has two roles in common with both Michael York and John Gielgud: (1) McDowell played King Arthur in Arthur the King (1985), York played him in The Wonderful World of Disney: A Knight in Camelot (1998) and Gielgud played him in DragonHeart (1996) and (2) McDowell played Merlin in Kids of the Round Table (1995), York played him in A Young Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\'s Court (1995) and Gielgud played him in Quest for Camelot (1998).      During the Ludivico scene in A Clockwork Orange (1971), McDowell\'s eyes were clamped open using a surgical device for eye surgery. The doctor applying eyedrops in the scene was an actual physician who was on hand in case of an injury. Nevertheless, McDowell\'s cornea was accidentally scratched as a result of the eye clamping and he suffered temporary blindness.      During the production of Tinto Brass\'s infamous epic Caligola (1979), McDowell took members of the production to dinner at an expensive restaurant to celebrate England\'s victory in a football match against an Italian team. He left the choreographer to pay for the meal, saying he had forgotten to bring enough money.      He was the first choice for the role of Winston Churchill in Young Winston (1972), which he repeatedly turned down. The role eventually went to Simon Ward.      Although his little known film Night Train to Venice (1996) was shown at the Cannes Film Festival in 1993, the film was not released until 1996, and then only in several countries.      He co-starred with his real-life nephew Alexander Siddig in the film Doomsday (2008).      He appeared in the music video ""Snuff"" by the heavy metal band Slipknot (2009).      His scenes in Our Friends in the North (1996) had to be shot in one continuous block, as he was only available for a limited time due to living in America.      He was considered for the role of Martin Taylor in Brimstone & Treacle (1982), which went to rock star Sting.      He was considered for the role of Tod Hackett in The Day of the Locust (1975), which went to William Atherton.      He was considered for the lead role of Don Morgan in Mad Dog Morgan (1976), which went to Dennis Hopper.      He was considered for the role of Perseus in Clash of the Titans (1981), which went to Harry Hamlin.      He was Richard Lester\'s first choice for D\'Artangan in The Three Musketeers (1973), which went to Michael York.      He was considered for the role of Billy the Kid in Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (1973), which went to Kris Kristofferson.      He was considered for a role in Stanley Kubrick\'s unmade biography of Napoleon.      He was going to have a role in Michael Powell\'s unmade film version of ""The Tempest"".      He refused the CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in 1984 and a knighthood in 1995.      He was originally going to star opposite Robert De Niro in Gangs of New York (2002) when Martin Scorsese was developing the project in 1978.      He was considered for the role of Ernest J. Belloq in Pretty Baby (1978), which went to Keith Carradine.      He was considered for the role of Scar in the Disney epic The Lion King (1994), which went to Jeremy Irons.      He was considered for the role of Juan Sánchez Villa-Lobos Ramírez in Highlander (1986), which went to Sean Connery.      He turned down the role of Admiral Geoffrey Tolwyn in Wing Commander (1999) due to his commitment to Fantasy Island (1998). The role went to David Warner. He previously played the role in Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger (1994).      He was considered for the role of Francis Bacon in Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon (1998), which went to Derek Jacobi.      He accepted the villain role in Star Trek: Generations (1994) despite not being a Star Trek fan and not liking the script very much, because he was asked, ""How would you like to kill Captain Kirk?"".      He was the original choice for the role of Peter Smythe in the horror film Black Christmas (1974), which he turned down. The role went to Keir Dullea.      He auditioned for the role of Brian Roberts in Cabaret (1972), which he turned down when he found out that this was not a singing role. The role went to Michael York.      He was offered the roles of John Mallory and Nolan in Once Upon a Time... the Revolution (1971), but he was busy with O Lucky Man! (1973). The roles went to James Coburn and David Warbeck respectively.      He was interested in guest-starring on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), but only if his nephew - Alexander Siddig (who played Dr. Bashir) - would direct the episode. He was offered the role of Hagath in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Business as Usual (1997), but he was unavailable. The role went to Steven Berkoff, McDowell\'s co-star in A Clockwork Orange (1971).      He was considered for the role of Saruman in Peter Jackson\'s Lord of the Rings trilogy, which went to Christopher Lee.      He named O Lucky Man! (1973) as his favourite film of his own.      Has English and Irish ancestry.Personal Quotes (24)      The best thing I did was abuse myself when younger - I dabbled in everything, cocaine, booze, women - because now I don\'t have to do it anymore.      There are no great scripts - just great films.      [when asked what his favorite Stanley Kubrick film was] A Clockwork Orange (1971)! I never saw any of the others.      [on A Clockwork Orange (1971)] It\'s a remarkable film that has survived as such a classic and I\'d be a raving idiot not to be thrilled with that.      He didn\'t want me at first, told me about the big-name actor he could get, how he was taller than I was - I\'m five eight and a half - but I said, ""That\'s nothing, I can stand on a box."".      I did a picture I loved called Time After Time (1979), and the people who saw it loved it. We had a big opening in Toronto at the Festival of Festivals - huge - and they gave us a fabulous reception. Great city, Toronto - Mary (Mary Steenburgen) and I loved it there. Great restaurants, great people. The studio hired these so-called ""experts"" to tell them how to market the film. And these silly asses took a poll to determine a ""recognition"" factor. And more people recognized Jack the Ripper, which was David Warner\'s role in the movie, than H.G. Wells, who I played in the movie. Hardly anyone recognized the name H.G. Wells, in fact. So they decided to go with a campaign that stressed Jack the Ripper, which was all well and good except that people didn\'t want to see another movie about Jack the Ripper, and they stayed away in droves. I\'ve got a big piece of that film, but I haven\'t seen a penny, and I probably never will. However, I did meet my wife making that movie, so I don\'t really mind!      [on Time After Time (1979)] I got to be the hero in that one. It\'s a very whimsical part, a wonderful part, H.G. running after Jack the Ripper (David Warner) and meeting this modern woman (Mary Steenburgen). Of course, it\'s very special to me because I met Mary, we got married, and we had two children. Even though we\'re not together now, she is the mother of my children and that film is where we met. It\'s also a damn good film!      [on unsimulated sex scenes in mainstream films, often sourced to his film Caligola (1979)] I think that\'s crap. I think that\'s pathetic. Go get another job. Listen: We\'re in the business of illusion. We are illusionists. Seriously, that is absolutely pathetic. You\'re telling me to do a love scene, you actually have to have penetration? That\'s absolutely beyond pathetic. If you can\'t think of any way of making that exciting, you\'re in the wrong job. That\'s what I think. I remember when they did Don\'t Look Now (1973), and they thought that Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie actually made love on camera. It\'s laughable. They were just two extremely gifted actors who made everybody believe they did and ran with it. There was no way there was penetration on the set. No way. Because that crosses over into a porno picture, and I don\'t care which way you dress it up.      [on playing psychiatrist Dr. Samuel Loomis in Halloween (2007)] I want to make Loomis a man with a tremendous ego. I\'ve met some of these doctors through the years, where there is more ego in it than there is [interest in what\'s] best for the patient, and if they can get a book out of it - which of course he has done - it\'s a bestseller, and that\'s so much better.      [on Donald Pleasence] I did know Donald. I met him in London at the Royal Court Theatre. He was a tremendous actor - he played those wonderful sinister parts. I particularly remember him in two performances: He was in two great plays, one was written by Robert Shaw called The Man in the Glass Booth (1975) and the other was a Harold Pinter play, The Caretaker (1963).      The definition of insanity in Texas is so insane that it\'s impossible to be insane in Texas.      [on Stanley Kubrick] Probably one of the five greatest directors that ever lived.      There\'s nobody who\'s ever going to come close to John Ford.      [on Halloween (1978)] John Carpenter\'s a master, and he made an extraordinary film.      [on horror movies] I\'m not that keen on them, to be honest. I find them tedious, most of them, really kind of schlocky and terrible character development and thin storylines. The ones that I\'ve seen, they\'re usually pretty bad because they\'re very low budget.      [on Wes Craven and The People Under the Stairs (1991)] I went to see the film and I was just riveted by this thing. I thought, ""My God, this guy is brilliant. I\'d love to work with him."".      [on playing the character Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange (1971)] I don\'t think I have ever had that much fun doing the work. He was a wicked son-of-a-bitch.      [on Rob Zombie] He\'s got a definite point of view. He has just done horror films because that\'s all they want him to make. For him to get out of that, which he will, is going to be tough. He is a far better director than a horror movie director. The way he looks at the material and the way he gives you rein but also gives you boundaries.      [on Lindsay Anderson] I loved him, more than any other man, ever. More than my father I think. I loved him.      [At ZomBcon] It is true I\'d rather get a hole in one than win an Academy Award.      [on Stanley Kubrick and A Clockwork Orange (1971)] I was fortunate enough to work with Stanley before his infamous paranoia set in (referring to Kubrick\'s obsession over every possible variation on a scene, and over everything that might - or at least could - go wrong while filming). One complex technical shot, on the waterfront, gave us so much trouble that 50 takes were required... so Stanley did have an excuse. Nonetheless, after Take 49, I asked him if we couldn\'t call this Take 1-A. ""If I have to hear \'Take 50,\'"" I complained, ""I feel I\'m going to crack."" But Stanley looked me in the face and said, very flatly, ""No"". So ""Take 50"" it was. Well, I *tried* to reason with him, anyway.      [2012, on his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame] For a lad that grew up in Liverpool, Hollywood was this notion of everything that was incredible in the movies, and Hollywood has meant so much for the rest of the world - we take it, because we live in L.A., sort of for granted. My father ran a pub in Burscough in Lancashire, just outside Liverpool, so I feel that from the Bull and Dog to the Pig and Whistle, it\'s not that far.      [on his career playing villains] I suppose I\'m primarily known for that but in fact, that would only be half of my career if I was to add it all up.      I\'m proud of the work I did in Caligola (1979). There\'s no question about that. But there\'s all the raunchy stuff-the blatant, modern-day porn that Bob introduced into the film after we would finished shooting. That to me was an absolutely outrageous betrayal and quite unprecedented. Frankly, it showed that Bob had no class whatsoever. When Gore told me it was Bob Guccione, I asked, \'Isn\'t he a pornographer?\' Gore said, \'Malcolm, just think of him as one of the Warner brothers. He just signs the checks!\' Well, of course that wasn\'t true...    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nDavid Thewlis ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 35 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(9)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(20)  Overview (3)Date of Birth20\xa0March1963,\xa0Blackpool, Lancashire, England, UK Birth NameDavid WheelerHeight6\'\xa02½""\xa0(1.9\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          David Thewlis was born David Wheeler in 1963 in Blackpool, Lancashire, to Maureen (Thewlis) and Alec Raymond Wheeler, and lived with his parents above their combination wallpaper and toy shop during his childhood. Originally, he came to London with his band Door 66, however he changed his plans and entered Guildhall School of Drama. He had minor roles in films and TV until he took the main role in Naked (1993). The film won him several awards including the New York Critics Award. He has since been in many other films including DragonHeart (1996), Restoration (1995), Black Beauty (1994) and recently took the part of Professor Remus John Lupin in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004). He has lived with the British actress Anna Friel since 2001.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Steffie          Spouse (1) Sara Sugarman (April 1992            - 1994)\xa0(divorced)          Trade Mark (1)        Towering heightTrivia (9)      Banned from entering China because of his role in Seven Years in Tibet (1997).      He and his ex-girlfriend, Anna Friel, became The Faces Of Mulberry in Spring 2002.      Was originally considered for the role of Professor Quirrell in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone (2001). He later got the role of Professor Lupin in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004).      Graduated from The Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London, England in 1984.      Turned down the role of Simon Gruber in Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), which was later given to Jeremy Irons.      During the filming of The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996), he fell off a horse and broke his leg.      Because he had such a bad experience working on The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996), he vowed never to see the final product. He skipped the opening premiere.      He was in a relationship with actress Anna Friel from 2001 - 2010. They have a daughter, Gracie Ellen Mary Thewlis, born on July 9, 2005.      He\'d been considered for the role of ""Montgomery"" in The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996) then, as filming was due to start, he was cast as ""Edward Douglas"", replacing Rob Morrow, who\'d dropped out.Personal Quotes (20)      The lifestyle I have now, and the opportunities I have had, are all down to Mike [Leigh] getting me on board in Naked. After Cannes, my agent told me to get the next flight to LA. He was right. I had a part in Prime Suspect 3 by the end of the week.      I don\'t worry. I\'m more stoical. Of course I have insecurities. I fear getting older. I fear death and illness. I\'m not prone to depression, but I get depressed because everybody gets depressed. Suddenly I\'m away from my family or doing a job I\'m not enjoying.      I keep myself content by doing lots of different stuff and make sure that my next role is completely different to the last. I just enjoy the versatility of it, the challenge of doing lots of different things. It keeps the job interesting.      I had such a nice time making it, and I can\'t wait to make the fifth one. The whole crew were just really, really lovely. All the costume people, the make-up girls, the kids - even my driver.      The very best thing about doing it is seeing the reaction on kid\'s faces when you tell them you\'ve done it.      When you do something well, this is the best job in the world.      I was still listening to the Beatles until I came here, you know.      Well I am afraid that I am going to die, because I have just put a down payment on a house.      And it was only released in London last week, so when I go back to England Monday or whatever, I am expecting heaps of adulation. I\'m hoping there is. If that doesn\'t happen I will be disappointed.      It wasn\'t a good idea to work on \'Naked\' in the first months of a marriage. I was living apart from my wife in a flat overflowing with books I was reading for the part.      It wasn\'t the greatest script in the world, but not many people can say they\'ve played a wicked king in a swashbuckling Arthurian special-effects monster movie.      I don\'t think Alfonso was a big expert on Potter either. He was feeling his way through it more than I was.      I met the Coens here a few years ago and they said they liked my work.      On Anna Friel: Before Anna, I\'d had a few relationships and I\'m glad I\'ve been around a bit. I know where it\'s gone wrong or know who are the wrong people for me and who I might be wrong for.      On relationship with now ex-girlfriend Anna Friel: It\'s certainly not easy having to spend a lot of time apart, and having a five-year-old child who\'s got to be at school. So we need to learn how to organize our time really well because for months we will be in two different countries.      Restoration I did because I really loved e novel and I like Michael Hoffman, who directed it, but it wasn\'t a really challenging part for me. I\'m not critical of the film: I just don\'t think I gave a very interesting performance.      Yeah, well that\'s the best thing about it, I think, is knowing kids and kids getting mental when they know you\'re in it. Any kid you meet and anyone I know tells the kid you\'re in it and they get short of breath.      I\'d been a stepparent for about two years with a woman who had a child, and I came to realize I adored children and was good with them. So I was very happy when Anna got pregnant.      The making of \'Naked\' was an absolutely phenomenal, mind-bending experience. That film was life-changing and put my career onto a whole different level.      I\'d only read a bit of the first book. And I just knew about all the media furor over it. But I\'d not read books 2 or 3. I\'d just read a bit of it. And I\'d seen the films.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nPaul Bettany ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 59 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(2)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(2)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(2)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(28)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(24)  Overview (2)Date of Birth27\xa0May1971,\xa0Harlesden, London, England, UK Height6\'\xa03½""\xa0(1.92\xa0m)    Mini Bio (2)Paul Bettany was born in Harlesden, London, England, into a theatre family. His father, Thane Bettany, is still an actor, but his mother, Anne Kettle, has retired from acting. His maternal grandmother, Olga Gwynne (her maiden and stage name), was a successful actress, while his maternal grandfather, Lesley Kettle, was a musician and promoter. He has an older sister who is a writer. Paul was brought up in North West London and, after the age of nine, in Hertfordshire (Brookmans Park). Immediately after finishing at Drama Centre London, he went into the West End to join the cast of ""An Inspector Calls"", though when asked to go on tour with this play, he chose to stay in England.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Anonymous          Paul Bettany is an English actor. He first came to the attention of mainstream audiences when he appeared in the British film Gangster No. 1 (2000), and director Brian Helgeland\'s film A Knight\'s Tale (2001). He has gone on to appear in a wide variety of films, including A Beautiful Mind (2001), Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003), Dogville (2003), Wimbledon (2004), and the adaptation of the novel The Da Vinci Code (2006). He is also known for his voice role as J.A.R.V.I.S. in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, specifically the films Iron Man (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), The Avengers (2012), Iron Man Three (2013), and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), in which he also portrayed the Vision, for which he garnered praise. He reprised his role as the Vision in Captain America: Civil War (2016).- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Pedro Borges          Spouse (1) Jennifer Connelly (1 January\xa02003            - present)\xa0(2 children)          Trade Mark (2)        Often plays secondary characters who are scene stealers        Towering height and slender frameTrivia (28)      Son of Thane Bettany and Anne Kettle. Has one older sister named Sarah, who lives in Cornwall (England) with her daughter Emaly.      Developed laryngitis after filming A Knight\'s Tale (2001) because of all the yelling he had to do as Geoffrey Chaucer.      Also plays the guitar, and used to busk on Westminster Bridge in London.      Acted for a year with the Royal Shakespeare Company.      Has a stepson named Kai Dugan (mother is Jennifer Connelly).      August 5, 2003 - his wife, Jennifer Connelly, gave birth to their first child, a boy.      Son\'s name is Stellan Bettany, named after the actor Stellan Skarsgård who acted with him in Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang) (2001), Dogville (2003) and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015).      Apparently turned down the role of the Tooth Fairy in Red Dragon (2002) (most probably offered to him after his frightening appearance as psycho gangster in Gangster No. 1 (2000)) in favour of a much more poorly paid role in Lars von Trier\'s Dogville (2003).      Has appeared in many theatre productions, debuting in Stephen Daldry\'s production of ""An Inspectors Calls,"" grabbing the American film industry\'s attention in Joe Penhall\'s ""Love and Understanding."" He also appeared in ""One More Waster Year"" and ""Stranger\'s House.""      Nominated for Best Actor for his role in Gangster No1 by London Film Critics Circle Awards.      Paul\'s ""acting heroes"" are Humphrey Bogart, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Peter O\'Toole and Vincent Cassel.      When he was 16, his younger brother Matthew, who was 8, died in a fall. Consequently, he claimed to be obsessed with having lots of children.      Won Evening Standard Film Award 2001 for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Geoffrey Chaucer in A Knight\'s Tale (2001).      Writer/director Brian Helgeland wrote the role of Chaucer in A Knight\'s Tale (2001) specifically for Paul. He ""refused"" to do the movie without him. The production companies did not think Bettany was known well enough, Helgeland thought that if he backed down on his choice of Bettany, he would have to back down on everything else.      Was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) in June 2004.      He had to wear a wig for The Da Vinci Code (2006) because, when they bleached his hair, the bleach burned bleeding holes in his head.      Gave up smoking in 2005 after seeing his 2 year-old son, Stellan, imitating him with a pen.      His son\'s godfather is the actor Charlie Condou who starred with him in Dead Babies (2000) and Euston Road (2004).      Grandson of Olga Gwynne and Lesley Kettle.      His wife, Jennifer Connelly, is expecting their second child, her third [December 14, 2010].      His wife Jennifer Connelly gave birth to their daughter Agnes Lark Bettany at home in New York City via a scheduled water birth (31 May 2011).      Was the first choice to portray King George VI in The King\'s Speech (2010) but after he turned it down Colin Firth, who went on to win the Best Actor Oscar for his performance, was cast instead.      Decided at the age of 19 that he wanted to be an actor.      Has acted in several religion-themed movies or played the part of a religious character, including: Priest (2011) and The Reckoning (2002) where he plays Priests who question their faith and go off on their own tangent; Legion (2010) where he plays the Archangel Michael who also questions his moral fibre and risks disobedience to God to do what he feels is right; and The Da Vinci Code (2006) where he plays an obsessive Monk who will do all he can to protect the secrets of Christianity.      Was considered for the role of Lord Asriel in The Golden Compass (2007). Some reports claimed that Nicole Kidman was eager to star in the film as she wished to work with him again, having previously co-starred with him in Dogville (2003).      In February 2014 it was announced that Bettany would be playing Vision in Marvel\'s Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). This marks not only his first on screen appearance in a Marvel movie but he will also be playing a dual role since he will also be voicing \'Jarvis\' Tony Stark/Iron Man\'s cyber man servant a role he has played four times previously.      Turned down the starring role of Dr. William Masters in Masters of Sex (2013) that went to Michael Sheen.      He and his wife Jennifer Connelly have played characters in films based on Marvel comic book characters. Bettany plays the voice of ""Jarvis"" in the ""Iron Man"" films as well as the live-action role of ""Vision"" in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). Connelly played Betty Ross, the love interest of Bruce Banner in Hulk (2003).Personal Quotes (24)      The world is split into two kinds of people, those who would go out for a drink with John Lennon, and those who\'d choose Paul McCartney ... After The Beatles came back from India, Lennon wrote ""Happiness Is a Warm Gun"" and McCartney wrote ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"". End of argument.      My plan - well, it isn\'t much of a plan, but it\'s mine and I like it - is to try to do lots of different things.      I love the way British people see ourselves. We say, \'He\'s like us, a bit of a loser.\'      A woman, who shall remain nameless, said to me, \'You\'re going to love LA, Paul, because over here ambition is not a dirty word.\' And I thought, \'Well, you\'ve named one of the things that I feel quite patriotic about.\' It\'s still a little bit embarrassing in Britain if you\'re seen to try.      One of my film heroes is Peter Weir, who made Fearless (1993) but also made Green Card (1990). Ang Lee makes a western, he makes a Seventies psycho movie, a costume drama and a monster movie. I wanted to be like that. I finished this in October and I haven\'t worked since, because my wife [the actress Jennifer Connelly] had just had the baby and I wanted to be with them. But I\'ve just taken on a film called Firewall (2006), which is a thriller with Harrison Ford. I\'m doing it because I\'ve never done a thriller before and I just get ... I just get bored if I don\'t do different things.      People like Cary Grant, Will Smith and Hugh Grant do it brilliantly. They are just relentlessly charming and self-deprecating. I found that really difficult. But there may be other reasons for that.      I wouldn\'t want to tumble with Harrison Ford in real life. He\'s a tough son of a bitch. I threw that man through a window seven times and he landed on his head, got up, rebuilt the window with the crew and then got thrown through it again. I hit that man in the stomach and he said, \'Could you just land it a bit harder so I could feel it?\' So I landed it a bit harder and he wanted a bit more so he could react to it. Finally, I just wound one up and let loose on him and he said, \'That\'s it!\' It was the most humiliating day of my life.      I\'m English, so I can\'t wear a baseball cap. I\'d look like white trash, like I should have a beer and a dog called Skeeter.      Recalling once attending a photo-shoot with Connelly where she was asked to wear just a bra: And she said, \'No, no, not gonna do it,\' and so they asked her to wear a man\'s dinner jacket. And I\'m thinking, \'How many times have I seen this, you unimaginative bastards?\' So she does it, and then the magazine cover gets pulled, \'cos she wouldn\'t wear the bra. Because that\'s what\'s men\'s magazines that are sort of soft porn want. They\'re more insidious than porn magazines.      On how Hollywood treats its female actors: In general it\'s so much more of an objectification. You know the drill, it\'s a true story. For instance, if I am being asked to have a picture taken on the cover of a magazine, maybe they\'re wanting me to look sexy, maybe they\'re wanting me to look rugged, maybe they\'re wanting me to look fragile. With a woman, they want you to look available, essentially, that you are in some way inviting. And that\'s just fucking depressing.      (On The Da Vinci Code (2006)) I\'d love to make a movie that shakes the world and offends people, but I really. Didn\'t think it was going to be this one. I think next to The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), it\'s Tonka Toys. Nobody seemed to get offended by Martin Scorsese\'s movie, no one seemed to get offended when Francis Ford Coppola made a movie where he suggested that the Mafia and the Vatican were in cahoots. Nobody picketed that. I play a monk who murders people, but it\'s no more a comment on monks than it is on people who wear sandals. Or big long brown dresses.      ... reading to both my kids has always been important. My wife, Jennifer, and I read to them every night. It\'s the most delicious time of the day when your child is all sleepy and cuddly and they get to snuggle up and you read them a bedtime story. It\'s the bit of parenting that makes up for when they\'re screaming and shouting at you.      I do love to make music. When I was younger, growing up in London, I\'d go to Westminster Bridge and play guitar to pick up a few coins from passersby. Every year we have a band that gets together and plays rock songs. This year, my stepson joined the band for the first time playing guitar and it was such a lovely, moving experience.      [on ""Charles Darwin"", whom he plays in Creation (2009)] - I couldn\'t believe the amount of violence that you can find on the Internet directed at a man who\'s been dead for a very long time. There\'s vicious diatribes full of hatred for Darwin. Actually, he was, by all accounts, one of the sweetest human beings you can possibly imagine. But there are still a lot of people who just can\'t accept his thinking without getting irrational. He was an atheist and so am I, but I don\'t think that makes me immoral.      When I was a kid I took some martial arts classes, but on Legion (2010) the stunt coordinators made you look like you can do the things that you can\'t, which is fantastic. I had an embarrassing amount of fun. It was like playing with a bunch of 10-year-olds who don\'t mind if you hit them. I had a scene where I threw a child zombie in the air who was attacking me. Actually, it was a small stunt person who was an adult. Everybody shot him and we were all giggling, even the poor guy who was being thrown. You can\'t take that stuff seriously.      I did Legion (2010) so I could shoot a big gun and channel Jackie Chan. I wouldn\'t lie to you. I don\'t like real guns, but the fake firearms are fantastic. My machine gun was huge and made a lot noise, but it didn\'t hurt anybody. I\'m usually the bad guy in movies like this, so I got a kick out of being the hero.      My dad made a lot of stories up at bedtime. He would create these wild stories about this elephant. As I got older, I remember him reading Lord of the Rings. My strongest memory was the moment when you think Frodo is dead and I forced him to read about 250 more pages until you realized he was okay.      [on his film Priest (2011)] The vampires in our film are creatures, they are full-on monsters and full-on ferocious, formidable beasts. They\'re really not your romantic idea of what the vampire is. This is a species that, in our world, has coexisted with human beings forever and we have just been managing a war forever...Now the war is over and the vampires are contained and the priests are relics. It\'s over for them, a little like Vietnam veterans...rendered totally unfit for normal life due to their experiences.      I love westerns and the reason I love really good westerns is because they are really classical. Their structure is like a Roman tragedy. Lots of violence, lots of vengeance and occasionally redemption. They are wonderfully brutal.      For some ungodly reason, I end up being naked in a lot of stuff. But there is a certain grace and kudos that come with taking your clothes off the first day, a respect that is given by the rest of the cast.      [on if there\'s anything about being a musician that prepares one for being an actor] Well, it\'s interesting. You know, I was able to look at a group of kids that were sitting on the stairs when I used to busk, which is play music, and I\'d be able to judge whether they were French or, you know, what their nationality was. So if they were French, I would think, ""Well, the Cure are huge in France, so I\'ll play a bunch of Cure songs."" So I suppose in sort of recognizing what your audience wants, but I say that with trepidation because I\'m not sure we should necessarily give the audience what they want. [laughs] You know what I mean? We live in a world where you make a film -- you spend two years in development, and then you spend six months in prep, then you shoot it for four months, and then spend another year editing it, and then you take it to a small town outside San Diego and show it to 60 teenagers, and then change your movie depending on what they say. I\'m lost. Now you\'ve lost me, because, you know, every 16-year-old boy is going to say, ""I think it should be a bit more like Underworld,"" you know what I mean? Should we then make every film a bit more like Underworld? I\'m not sure that that\'s a great way to go about creating new stuff.      [on if he likes to play characters who only see in black and white] No, I don\'t. I think, conversely, I sort of see the job of my life being a process of becoming less judgmental as I get older. That\'s what I want to do. Acting has so many vain and awful things about it, but one of the really edifying things about it is you can, at times, get the opportunity to put yourself imaginatively in another human being\'s position and try to see things from their perspective. I see that as a real gift, and I hope that this is part of making me a better human being, whatever that f---ing means. But I mean it, you know? I do at least mean it. I really want to make films that I care about, and this film [""Margin Call""] really sparked an awakening in me, just remembering all of the reasons I initially wanted to be an actor. It was just a fantastic experience. Seventeen days, we shot this f---ing movie; it was just unbelievable. It was an unbelievable comradely experience, and I hanker after it. You know, I\'ve been on jobs that were seven months long, and I have many more memories of this job than those.      [on Raging Bull (1980)] I defy anybody to point out one thing that\'s wrong with it. It\'s just perfect.      [on Daniel Day-Lewis and his performance in In the Name of the Father (1993)] It is one of the most exquisite performances of all time. I saw it when I was a student of acting, and there was lots of people to admire; there was Robert De Niro, and there was Al Pacino, and here was an English person, making such a complete and visceral transformation in character that you just went, ""Oh my God, we\'re allowed to do that sort of thing, too?""

The story might be rather ordinary and it may become less interesting
after the first hour or so, but this is generally intriguing stuff. The
film is effectively narrated and performed by Malcolm McDowell, but
Paul Bettany is the one who really shines here, replicating McDowell's
charisma as an uncaring and violent youth, whilst also injecting some
of his own spirit into his character. The film is rather clever in fact
with how it uses McDowell and what he has come to stand for, with a
number of interesting echoes of A Clockwork Orange throughout the film.
The biggest problem that I found in the whole production was that the
flashbacks to the 1960s looked just like the present with no feel for
the era. But really, other than that and a story that is not out of the
ordinary, this is a well made film with an interesting visual and audio
style, and quality acting to top it all off.

Its easy to see why people think this film is over violent and trying
to shock, but then thats because they just don't get the finer nuances.<br><br>This film is Excellent. The direction is amazing and Bettany, Thewlis
and McDowell are all superb. The film runs from the point of view of
the main character, Gangster, He shows how he got to the top of his
game to be Gangster No1. All of the violence in the film makes a valid
point some of it is horrific, none of it is unnecessary. The film also
comments on the social avarice that penetrates our society, wealth,
power and fame, I think the points it makes are truly justified.<br><br>Why do some people dislike this film? They are uncomfortable with
people being portrayed as being comfortable with violence, and thats
because the director wants you to be, and because the Actors are so
good at it. The film freaked me out in two scenes and there was no
violence just excellent direction and Acting.<br><br>Well worth watching, well worth buying on DVD.

The story begins in 1999, with an old gangster performed by Malcolm
McDowell being advised that Freddie Mays (David Thewlis) would leave
jail after thirty years in prison. His mood changes and he recalls
1968, when he was a young punk (performed by Paul Bettany), and he
joined Freddie Mays' gang, his envy of his mob boss and his betrayal.
The whole story of these two characters is presented slowly,
alternating violent and luxury places and action. I liked this movie a
lot. I would dare to say that it mixes 'Goodfellas', 'Casino', 'Pulp
Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs'. Paul Bettany has a great performance as
a psycho-killer: differently of those sadists in Hollywood movies that
make grimaces, the simple look and expression of Paul Bettany is enough
to terrify the viewer. The direction is great, and there is one
specific scene that I appreciated very much. When Freddie Mays invites
Paul Bettany's character to have a drink in a nightclub: Freddie is
giving his overcoat to the attendant and the image of Paul Bettany is
reflected in the glass of the door exactly over Freddie. The selection
of Paul Bettany for this role is perfect, but why not ages him through
make-up? Malcolm McDowell looks totally different from Paul Bettany! My
vote is eight.<br><br>Title (Brazil): ""Os Gangsters"" (""The Gangsters"")

What a mug! The evil-harlequin mask of Malcolm McDowell, so familiar from
those bugeyed closeups of him ""mounching lumpchiks of toast"" in A
CLOCKWORK
ORANGE, has aged into a fabulous ruin. And one of the pleasures of the
glib,
slick, cocky, brutal, shallow, and terrifically entertaining GANGSTER NO.
1
is in the realization that McDowell is the same McDowell--his voiceover
has
the same energetic sneer it had 31 years ago in CLOCKWORK. He's the same
guy
under a withered and weathered facade. As Gangster No. 1--a sociopath with
a
schoolgirl crush on his boss, spit-shined David Thewlis--McDowell brings
you
into the succulent pleasures of aged corruption and long-swallowed
brutality. No. 1's nuttiness--a kind of belch of guilt, generally released
in Francis Bacon-derivative silent screams--seems, for a while, like fun.
Paul Bettany, playing Young No. 1, has a great, lizardlike, histrionic
deadpan--he keeps telling his victims ""Look into my eyes!"" as if something
scary and deep were hidden there. (Instead, there is zero--an effect Young
No. 1 may be unaware of.) The movie takes such a jaunty and directorially
piquant view of its own shin-kicking nihilism that you can't help but play
along; until the moralizing but utterly earned finale sets you on your
ear.<br><br>Not deep stuff--not even as deep as the superbly unself-reflective
head-smackers who made up GOODFELLAS' crew. But Saffron Burrows, as a
Cockney chanteuse who's mad in love with Thewlis' Mr. Big, brings you back
to the days of much-posher-and-prettier-than-their-parts British character
actresses. (Could Burrows in fact be the Susannah York of the millennium?)
And the director, Paul McGuigan, and Bettany keep the joint jumpin'. Why
did
this get such a crummy release? There's been almost nothing this year as
sheerly, undilutedly fun.

I loved this movie soooo much! I was first introduced two thirds into
it and I was immediately ready to sit down and watch it at three in the
morning staying up till five am. The way it is shot is like pure
genius! There is a scene in it that is shot from the perspective of the
person being murdered and I mean it is aw inspiring! Seriously if it
weren't for the way this movie ended it it would have been a 10 on my
voting. Point in fact though the ending isn't horrible it just leaves a
little to be desired. NON-SPOILER ALERT about the ending, they use a
different person for the main character as the older version, but
everyone else plays themselves just with makeup....(Don't get me wrong
the guy they got 'Malcolm McDowell' to play as the older gangster is
the best narrator and therefore carries the movie, but it's just weird
and very hard to over look) Not to mention Paul Bettany who is a genius
in this movie as well! My god the man can play psycho! All and all a
must watch and a pass on to any friend who is in the mood to see a
great flick!!!!!

Gangster No.1 shows the rise and fall of a prominent English gangster.
Malcolm McDowell is Gangster 55, telling the story in voice overs, and
Paul Bettany shines as the Young Gangster giving a great performance,
which carries the film from cookie cutter gangster film, to one of the
best.<br><br>This film is filled with inspirations from many others, such as
Goodfellas, Reservoir Dogs, Get Shorty, etc. While some do work, such
as ""Look into my eyes"", others don't, McGuigan, near the end of the
film, fast forwards through decades in just a couple of minutes, we
don't feel like we are with these people throughout their reign of
terror in England. The film does have bits of originality, such as the
""torture"" while we see the FPV of the victim, fades in and out in his
dying minutes, as the killer stands over his body, continuing the
slaughter.<br><br>Paul Bettany shows how good he is in this film as he carries it to
another level. His eyes in his ""Look into my eyes"" scenes are so hollow
and terrifying that you know if he was interrogating you, that he could
and probably would kill you at anytime. He has the look in his sharp
suits and the style. It's a shame no awards went his way. McDowell, to
me in this film is a little bit of, I don't know how to say it, but he
didn't do all that much for me. The rest of the cast holds up well,
blending well with the story line and environments they are put in.<br><br>The script is sharp and has a Goodfellas/Reservoir Dogs feel to it, the
Goodfellas aspect shows the rise and fall, where as Reservoir Dogs,
comes from it's dialouge. I've never heard the word c*nt used so many
times. The film took it's time to showcase the rise of this young
gangster from a common thug, to a crime lord. The one thing that did
out me off though was the fact the he was just picked up out of a bar
and given a spot. When Freddie goes to prison, that's when the young
gangster takes his spot in being no. 1. Years go by and Freddie finally
is released, while McDowell eagerly awaits his return, he expect some
conflict, but what he get is a let down, I won't ruin what happens, but
you'd expect something explosive.<br><br>So Gangster No. 1 showcases great performances from the actors involved
and shows a great story that takes it time, instead of bang bang,
you're dead. The film just lacks that one special thing to take it to
greatness, above and beyond those other movies, but for now, it can
just be the one to stand out.

I saw this movie to see Paul Bettany once again.  I enjoyed his performances
in &lt;A Beautiful Mind&gt; and &lt;A Knight's Tale&gt;, and wanted to see
him in something heavier.  Gangster No 1 seemed like the ideal role to see
how he'd fare.<br><br>He looks great decked out in Saville Row's finery, and has an unnerving
composure which suits the role.  The crude language seems more natural
coming from him than from McDowell's older Gangster, or Thewlin's Mays.  But
the scenes in which he is supposed to be shooting daggers with his gaze at
Karen, his rival for Mays' affection, seem comical and remind me of all the
menace my five-year-old can muster in his stares.<br><br>There is much lifted from other films, but McGuigan chooses his source
material well.  The &lt;Reservoir Dogs&gt; inspired the bubbly soundtrack to
Lenny Taylor's goring, while &lt;American Psycho&gt; inspired the methodical
disrobing and laying out of goring implements in that scene.  &lt;Get
Shorty&gt;'s Travolta gets the ""Look into my eyes"" thing right:  it's cool
apathy we're supposed to see, not Bettany's hammed-up intensity.  &lt;Good
Fellas&gt; inspires the ""Business was never better"" sequence, though
McGuigan's lacks any significant depth, catching up on three decades in
three minutes.  <br><br>Some original stuff too:  While a gangster falls for the 'Bird' in this
film, as in &lt;Bugsy&gt; or &lt;Billy Bathgate&gt;, it is not Mays'
undoing, it is what saves him.  The first person perspective on Taylor's
goring works well, especially with fades in and out of consciousness.  The
jarring flash-forwards to Gangster's fierce attacks also work well.  And I
have never seen the c***-word used more liberally.<br><br>What McGuigan, Bettany and McDowell do especially well is to reveal the
emptiness of Gangster's relentlessly evil lifestyle.  His disloyalty,
jealousy, cruelty, vanity, and his hunger for power leave him paranoid,
unloved, and suicidal.  His touchstones of power and invulnerability---Superman
and King Kong---are not human, perhaps showing how dehumanizing such
physical invulnerability can be.  But he remains vulnerable emotionally, and
relies on bullying an old mate in Mays' crew, Mays' girlfriend, and Mays
himself to stoke his fragile ego.<br><br>A movie with some substance and style, but no virtuosos in this

GANGSTER NO.1 (2002) *** Malcolm McDowell, Paul Bettany, David Thewlis,
Saffron Burrows.   Bloody good Brit flick about English thugs recalled in
flashback by McDowell and portrayed by  Bettany (both equally excellent in
a
teeth-gnashing kind of way) recollecting their bumpy ride to the top and
rocky relationship with head kingpin Thewlis getting in the way.
Graphically violent yet smartly directed by Paul McGuigan eschewing
stylistic violence for violence sake and encapsulating the Mod 60s
effectively.

Gangsters are vicious, murderous thugs, whose power is based on uniform,
military might, a preying on the weak and a contempt for democracy.  Nazis
were vicious, murderous thugs whose power was based on uniform, military
might, a preying on the weak and a contempt for democracy.  Ergo,
gangsters
are fascists, and, double ergo, films which portray gangsters without a
wagging finger are also fascist.  This is the level of critical debate in
the UK at the moment, that has greeted the recent slew of British gangster
films in the wake of LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS.  One misinformed
hack in a major broadsheet even insinuated a link between this movement
and
recent, violent London crime.<br><br>The problem with these films is an aesthetic, not an ethical one, and the
type of ignorant criticism they have drawn reveals a lingering bourgeois
contempt for a genre that has proved over the decades to be infinitely
varied, subtle, adaptable, but, most importantly, through an awesomely
powerful iconography, capable of exploring ideas about society and the
individual, modernisation, capitalism, dissent, cinema, masculinity,
violence, the body, role-play, psychology, sociology, metaphysics.  Can a
genre embraced and remodelled by directors as diverse as Feuillade, Von
Sternberg, Hawks, Lang, Lewis, Melville, Godard, Suzuki, Coppola,
Scorcese,
Kitano, among many others be considered negligible?  The problem with
these
new films, as I say, is not that they are overly violent or glamorise
crime,
but that they are ineptly made, hackneyed, opportunistic, with their
makers
revealing little knowledge of, or love for, the genre in which they're
working.<br><br>It's a pity for GANGSTER NO. 1 that it got caught up in this cycle,
because
it is a very good film, that maybe fails only in overambition, and that's
not something we get to complain about very often.  Ironically, the film's
nearest model is not its sorry peers, or even archetypal classics like GET
CARTER, but an American film, Soderbergh's THE LIMEY.  Maybe these
directors' non-Englishness (MacGuigan is Irish) allows them to cut through
the phoney nostalgia more easily than native filmmakers, but their
dismantling of gangster mythology is almost Melvillean (eg LE DOULOS).<br><br>There is the same fluidity here as in LIMEY, the same sense of the past's
stranglehold on the present, the same impatience with genre's limits, with
the impossibility of family, with the stifling of humanity by barbaric
codes
and ideals.  MacGuigan goes one further than Soderbergh - both directors
emphasis role-playing, casting iconic 60s stars who seem to be making  it
up
as they go along, having a laugh, trying on accents and clothes, but while
Terence Stamp achieves some kind of grace, Malcolm MacDowall goes very
uncoolly mad.<br><br>There are three pointers in the first ten minutes that tell us where the
film is going in its refusal to glamorise, to mythologise.  First is the
soundtrack, which is not the pumping macho nostalgic music beloved of the
LOCK STOCK wannabes, but Sacha Distel - sung with heartbreaking sincerity
by
Neil Hannon, but Sacha Distel none the less.  Secondly, the film opens at
a
business-like dinner of old gangsters blustering about the old times,
MacDowell louder than most.  If the flippant editing didn't tell us, the
bathetic mocking of MacDowell when he leaves  to relieve himself suggests
that we shouldn't take everything he says too faithfully (or, in his
straight-to-camera gesture, that he knows a lot more, eg about these
'friends', than he's letting on - is he a godlike creator?).  In the third
scene, champagne glass beside his feet, we notice his aim isn't quite what
it was, and the title takes on rather a different, less iconic
meaning.<br><br>It is this man who tells the story, and it quickly becomes clear that he
is
a raving lunatic, and thus as reliable as Humbert or M.  This has two
effects - every scene becomes infected by his madness, is heightened, in
terms of colour and composition, by the way he sees the world, which is
hightly unstable and schizophrenic, alternately jokey and horribly
violent,
with certain markers recurring in a kind of dream loop.<br><br>Secondly, we must look beyond his words to find the truth of each scene,
forcing the viewer to play detective.  This takes the power away from
MacDowell, which is appropriate in a film about doubles, about hoow one
man
steals another man's identity (hence the foregrounding of mirrors,
reflections, as well as the commodities that define people), only to lose
his own.<br><br>MacDowell is never known by a name (his character is played by two
actors,
the others by one), and becomes a mere cipher, though with very real,
frightening power, while Frankie remains essentially himself, his image a
mere show of strength, never his whole self.  The style reinforces this,
and
perhaps reflects MacGuigan's background in advertising, but neither Scott
nor Parker ever rooted their style in character to such effect, and the
fragmentation, heightening and distortion of imagery could have two
meanings
- they reveal a chaotic world which MacDowell, with all his will, and
figured in his voiceover, has managed to unify through the power of his
identity and voice; or they are a sign of breakdown.  The extraordinary
coda
reveals which.<br><br>There have been complaints about the excessive violence of this film, but
these scenes have a hallucinatory, ritualistic quality appropriate to a
highly disciplined madman.  GANGSTER's abstraction - that it's subject is
gangster mythology rather than one particular protagonist per se, does not
mean that it avoids social grounding - the vivid recreation of 60s London,
only makes the unaccountable, inexplicable appearance of this phenomenon
all
the more alarming.

denounement.<br><br>One slight criticism.  The old `end of act-two problem' rears its ugly
head
at around an hour and fifteen minutes. Yes, the film becomes bogged down
rather as Malcolm McDowell goes on a panicky cockney walkabout waiting
for
Freddie Mays to be released from prison. And when the two finally meet,
in
what was once Freddie May's luxury 60's pad, the scene isn't quite as
explosive as you'd hoped it might be.<br><br>Nevertheless, Gangster No1 is an excellent film. A credible gangster
flick,
a stylish revisiting of the 60's East End, a cracking script, and spot-on
dialogue.<br><br>Oh and the critics were right, the performances are ` diamond -edged'.
Funny
that.

The story might be rather ordinary and it may become less interesting
after the first hour or so, but this is generally intriguing stuff. The
film is effectively narrated and performed by Malcolm McDowell, but
Paul Bettany is the one who really shines here, replicating McDowell's
charisma as an uncaring and violent youth, whilst also injecting some
of his own spirit into his character. The film is rather clever in fact
with how it uses McDowell and what he has come to stand for, with a
number of interesting echoes of A Clockwork Orange throughout the film.
The biggest problem that I found in the whole production was that the
flashbacks to the 1960s looked just like the present with no feel for
the era. But really, other than that and a story that is not out of the
ordinary, this is a well made film with an interesting visual and audio
style, and quality acting to top it all off.

Its easy to see why people think this film is over violent and trying
to shock, but then thats because they just don't get the finer nuances.<br><br>This film is Excellent. The direction is amazing and Bettany, Thewlis
and McDowell are all superb. The film runs from the point of view of
the main character, Gangster, He shows how he got to the top of his
game to be Gangster No1. All of the violence in the film makes a valid
point some of it is horrific, none of it is unnecessary. The film also
comments on the social avarice that penetrates our society, wealth,
power and fame, I think the points it makes are truly justified.<br><br>Why do some people dislike this film? They are uncomfortable with
people being portrayed as being comfortable with violence, and thats
because the director wants you to be, and because the Actors are so
good at it. The film freaked me out in two scenes and there was no
violence just excellent direction and Acting.<br><br>Well worth watching, well worth buying on DVD.

The story begins in 1999, with an old gangster performed by Malcolm
McDowell being advised that Freddie Mays (David Thewlis) would leave
jail after thirty years in prison. His mood changes and he recalls
1968, when he was a young punk (performed by Paul Bettany), and he
joined Freddie Mays' gang, his envy of his mob boss and his betrayal.
The whole story of these two characters is presented slowly,
alternating violent and luxury places and action. I liked this movie a
lot. I would dare to say that it mixes 'Goodfellas', 'Casino', 'Pulp
Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs'. Paul Bettany has a great performance as
a psycho-killer: differently of those sadists in Hollywood movies that
make grimaces, the simple look and expression of Paul Bettany is enough
to terrify the viewer. The direction is great, and there is one
specific scene that I appreciated very much. When Freddie Mays invites
Paul Bettany's character to have a drink in a nightclub: Freddie is
giving his overcoat to the attendant and the image of Paul Bettany is
reflected in the glass of the door exactly over Freddie. The selection
of Paul Bettany for this role is perfect, but why not ages him through
make-up? Malcolm McDowell looks totally different from Paul Bettany! My
vote is eight.<br><br>Title (Brazil): ""Os Gangsters"" (""The Gangsters"")

What a mug! The evil-harlequin mask of Malcolm McDowell, so familiar from
those bugeyed closeups of him ""mounching lumpchiks of toast"" in A
CLOCKWORK
ORANGE, has aged into a fabulous ruin. And one of the pleasures of the
glib,
slick, cocky, brutal, shallow, and terrifically entertaining GANGSTER NO.
1
is in the realization that McDowell is the same McDowell--his voiceover
has
the same energetic sneer it had 31 years ago in CLOCKWORK. He's the same
guy
under a withered and weathered facade. As Gangster No. 1--a sociopath with
a
schoolgirl crush on his boss, spit-shined David Thewlis--McDowell brings
you
into the succulent pleasures of aged corruption and long-swallowed
brutality. No. 1's nuttiness--a kind of belch of guilt, generally released
in Francis Bacon-derivative silent screams--seems, for a while, like fun.
Paul Bettany, playing Young No. 1, has a great, lizardlike, histrionic
deadpan--he keeps telling his victims ""Look into my eyes!"" as if something
scary and deep were hidden there. (Instead, there is zero--an effect Young
No. 1 may be unaware of.) The movie takes such a jaunty and directorially
piquant view of its own shin-kicking nihilism that you can't help but play
along; until the moralizing but utterly earned finale sets you on your
ear.<br><br>Not deep stuff--not even as deep as the superbly unself-reflective
head-smackers who made up GOODFELLAS' crew. But Saffron Burrows, as a
Cockney chanteuse who's mad in love with Thewlis' Mr. Big, brings you back
to the days of much-posher-and-prettier-than-their-parts British character
actresses. (Could Burrows in fact be the Susannah York of the millennium?)
And the director, Paul McGuigan, and Bettany keep the joint jumpin'. Why
did
this get such a crummy release? There's been almost nothing this year as
sheerly, undilutedly fun.

I loved this movie soooo much! I was first introduced two thirds into
it and I was immediately ready to sit down and watch it at three in the
morning staying up till five am. The way it is shot is like pure
genius! There is a scene in it that is shot from the perspective of the
person being murdered and I mean it is aw inspiring! Seriously if it
weren't for the way this movie ended it it would have been a 10 on my
voting. Point in fact though the ending isn't horrible it just leaves a
little to be desired. NON-SPOILER ALERT about the ending, they use a
different person for the main character as the older version, but
everyone else plays themselves just with makeup....(Don't get me wrong
the guy they got 'Malcolm McDowell' to play as the older gangster is
the best narrator and therefore carries the movie, but it's just weird
and very hard to over look) Not to mention Paul Bettany who is a genius
in this movie as well! My god the man can play psycho! All and all a
must watch and a pass on to any friend who is in the mood to see a
great flick!!!!!

Gangster No.1 shows the rise and fall of a prominent English gangster.
Malcolm McDowell is Gangster 55, telling the story in voice overs, and
Paul Bettany shines as the Young Gangster giving a great performance,
which carries the film from cookie cutter gangster film, to one of the
best.<br><br>This film is filled with inspirations from many others, such as
Goodfellas, Reservoir Dogs, Get Shorty, etc. While some do work, such
as ""Look into my eyes"", others don't, McGuigan, near the end of the
film, fast forwards through decades in just a couple of minutes, we
don't feel like we are with these people throughout their reign of
terror in England. The film does have bits of originality, such as the
""torture"" while we see the FPV of the victim, fades in and out in his
dying minutes, as the killer stands over his body, continuing the
slaughter.<br><br>Paul Bettany shows how good he is in this film as he carries it to
another level. His eyes in his ""Look into my eyes"" scenes are so hollow
and terrifying that you know if he was interrogating you, that he could
and probably would kill you at anytime. He has the look in his sharp
suits and the style. It's a shame no awards went his way. McDowell, to
me in this film is a little bit of, I don't know how to say it, but he
didn't do all that much for me. The rest of the cast holds up well,
blending well with the story line and environments they are put in.<br><br>The script is sharp and has a Goodfellas/Reservoir Dogs feel to it, the
Goodfellas aspect shows the rise and fall, where as Reservoir Dogs,
comes from it's dialouge. I've never heard the word c*nt used so many
times. The film took it's time to showcase the rise of this young
gangster from a common thug, to a crime lord. The one thing that did
out me off though was the fact the he was just picked up out of a bar
and given a spot. When Freddie goes to prison, that's when the young
gangster takes his spot in being no. 1. Years go by and Freddie finally
is released, while McDowell eagerly awaits his return, he expect some
conflict, but what he get is a let down, I won't ruin what happens, but
you'd expect something explosive.<br><br>So Gangster No. 1 showcases great performances from the actors involved
and shows a great story that takes it time, instead of bang bang,
you're dead. The film just lacks that one special thing to take it to
greatness, above and beyond those other movies, but for now, it can
just be the one to stand out.

I saw this movie to see Paul Bettany once again.  I enjoyed his performances
in &lt;A Beautiful Mind&gt; and &lt;A Knight's Tale&gt;, and wanted to see
him in something heavier.  Gangster No 1 seemed like the ideal role to see
how he'd fare.<br><br>He looks great decked out in Saville Row's finery, and has an unnerving
composure which suits the role.  The crude language seems more natural
coming from him than from McDowell's older Gangster, or Thewlin's Mays.  But
the scenes in which he is supposed to be shooting daggers with his gaze at
Karen, his rival for Mays' affection, seem comical and remind me of all the
menace my five-year-old can muster in his stares.<br><br>There is much lifted from other films, but McGuigan chooses his source
material well.  The &lt;Reservoir Dogs&gt; inspired the bubbly soundtrack to
Lenny Taylor's goring, while &lt;American Psycho&gt; inspired the methodical
disrobing and laying out of goring implements in that scene.  &lt;Get
Shorty&gt;'s Travolta gets the ""Look into my eyes"" thing right:  it's cool
apathy we're supposed to see, not Bettany's hammed-up intensity.  &lt;Good
Fellas&gt; inspires the ""Business was never better"" sequence, though
McGuigan's lacks any significant depth, catching up on three decades in
three minutes.  <br><br>Some original stuff too:  While a gangster falls for the 'Bird' in this
film, as in &lt;Bugsy&gt; or &lt;Billy Bathgate&gt;, it is not Mays'
undoing, it is what saves him.  The first person perspective on Taylor's
goring works well, especially with fades in and out of consciousness.  The
jarring flash-forwards to Gangster's fierce attacks also work well.  And I
have never seen the c***-word used more liberally.<br><br>What McGuigan, Bettany and McDowell do especially well is to reveal the
emptiness of Gangster's relentlessly evil lifestyle.  His disloyalty,
jealousy, cruelty, vanity, and his hunger for power leave him paranoid,
unloved, and suicidal.  His touchstones of power and invulnerability---Superman
and King Kong---are not human, perhaps showing how dehumanizing such
physical invulnerability can be.  But he remains vulnerable emotionally, and
relies on bullying an old mate in Mays' crew, Mays' girlfriend, and Mays
himself to stoke his fragile ego.<br><br>A movie with some substance and style, but no virtuosos in this
one.<br><br>6 of 10

GANGSTER NO.1 (2002) *** Malcolm McDowell, Paul Bettany, David Thewlis,
Saffron Burrows.   Bloody good Brit flick about English thugs recalled in
flashback by McDowell and portrayed by  Bettany (both equally excellent in
a
teeth-gnashing kind of way) recollecting their bumpy ride to the top and
rocky relationship with head kingpin Thewlis getting in the way.
Graphically violent yet smartly directed by Paul McGuigan eschewing
stylistic violence for violence sake and encapsulating the Mod 60s
effectively.

Gangsters are vicious, murderous thugs, whose power is based on uniform,
military might, a preying on the weak and a contempt for democracy.  Nazis
were vicious, murderous thugs whose power was based on uniform, military
might, a preying on the weak and a contempt for democracy.  Ergo,
gangsters
are fascists, and, double ergo, films which portray gangsters without a
wagging finger are also fascist.  This is the level of critical debate in
the UK at the moment, that has greeted the recent slew of British gangster
films in the wake of LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS.  One misinformed
hack in a major broadsheet even insinuated a link between this movement
and
recent, violent London crime.<br><br>The problem with these films is an aesthetic, not an ethical one, and the
type of ignorant criticism they have drawn reveals a lingering bourgeois
contempt for a genre that has proved over the decades to be infinitely
varied, subtle, adaptable, but, most importantly, through an awesomely
powerful iconography, capable of exploring ideas about society and the
individual, modernisation, capitalism, dissent, cinema, masculinity,
violence, the body, role-play, psychology, sociology, metaphysics.  Can a
genre embraced and remodelled by directors as diverse as Feuillade, Von
Sternberg, Hawks, Lang, Lewis, Melville, Godard, Suzuki, Coppola,
Scorcese,
Kitano, among many others be considered negligible?  The problem with
these
new films, as I say, is not that they are overly violent or glamorise
crime,
but that they are ineptly made, hackneyed, opportunistic, with their
makers
revealing little knowledge of, or love for, the genre in which they're
working.<br><br>It's a pity for GANGSTER NO. 1 that it got caught up in this cycle,
because
it is a very good film, that maybe fails only in overambition, and that's
not something we get to complain about very often.  Ironically, the film's
nearest model is not its sorry peers, or even archetypal classics like GET
CARTER, but an American film, Soderbergh's THE LIMEY.  Maybe these
directors' non-Englishness (MacGuigan is Irish) allows them to cut through
the phoney nostalgia more easily than native filmmakers, but their
dismantling of gangster mythology is almost Melvillean (eg LE DOULOS).<br><br>There is the same fluidity here as in LIMEY, the same sense of the past's
stranglehold on the present, the same impatience with genre's limits, with
the impossibility of family, with the stifling of humanity by barbaric
codes
and ideals.  MacGuigan goes one further than Soderbergh - both directors
emphasis role-playing, casting iconic 60s stars who seem to be making  it
up
as they go along, having a laugh, trying on accents and clothes, but while
Terence Stamp achieves some kind of grace, Malcolm MacDowall goes very
uncoolly mad.<br><br>There are three pointers in the first ten minutes that tell us where the
film is going in its refusal to glamorise, to mythologise.  First is the
soundtrack, which is not the pumping macho nostalgic music beloved of the
LOCK STOCK wannabes, but Sacha Distel - sung with heartbreaking sincerity
by
Neil Hannon, but Sacha Distel none the less.  Secondly, the film opens at
a
business-like dinner of old gangsters blustering about the old times,
MacDowell louder than most.  If the flippant editing didn't tell us, the
bathetic mocking of MacDowell when he leaves  to relieve himself suggests
that we shouldn't take everything he says too faithfully (or, in his
straight-to-camera gesture, that he knows a lot more, eg about these
'friends', than he's letting on - is he a godlike creator?).  In the third
scene, champagne glass beside his feet, we notice his aim isn't quite what
it was, and the title takes on rather a different, less iconic
meaning.<br><br>It is this man who tells the story, and it quickly becomes clear that he
is
a raving lunatic, and thus as reliable as Humbert or M.  This has two
effects - every scene becomes infected by his madness, is heightened, in
terms of colour and composition, by the way he sees the world, which is
hightly unstable and schizophrenic, alternately jokey and horribly
violent,
with certain markers recurring in a kind of dream loop.<br><br>Secondly, we must look beyond his words to find the truth of each scene,
forcing the viewer to play detective.  This takes the power away from
MacDowell, which is appropriate in a film about doubles, about hoow one
man
steals another man's identity (hence the foregrounding of mirrors,
reflections, as well as the commodities that define people), only to lose
his own.<br><br>MacDowell is never known by a name (his character is played by two
actors,
the others by one), and becomes a mere cipher, though with very real,
frightening power, while Frankie remains essentially himself, his image a
mere show of strength, never his whole self.  The style reinforces this,
and
perhaps reflects MacGuigan's background in advertising, but neither Scott
nor Parker ever rooted their style in character to such effect, and the
fragmentation, heightening and distortion of imagery could have two
meanings
- they reveal a chaotic world which MacDowell, with all his will, and
figured in his voiceover, has managed to unify through the power of his
identity and voice; or they are a sign of breakdown.  The extraordinary
coda
reveals which.<br><br>There have been complaints about the excessive violence of this film, but
these scenes have a hallucinatory, ritualistic quality appropriate to a
highly disciplined madman.  GANGSTER's abstraction - that it's subject is
gangster mythology rather than one particular protagonist per se, does not
mean that it avoids social grounding - the vivid recreation of 60s London,
only makes the unaccountable, inexplicable appearance of this phenomenon
all
the more alarming.

Attended the Fieldston Summer Performing Arts Institute      He was raised by his mother, Karesse Grenier, a New York City real estate agent. Growing up, he didn\'t know who his father was. His parents met while living in a commune, and split up soon after Adrian\'s birth.

We\'re like Siamese twins, if you separate us, I\'ll die.      Certainly, if it had been anything other than an HBO show I\'d probably still be in Mexico now with a Mexican wife and kids.      Celebrities become divas because they get pampered so much, babied so much - then they get used to it.      Being performers, that\'s what we do: We put on shows and want people to watch.      My only ambition when I came to Hollywood was to pay my rent.      It\'s enough to indulge and to be selfish but true happiness is really when you start giving back.      I was rebellious.      I want to show people that environmentalism can be fun!      I think, in a lot of ways, celebrities represent the American dream. They have financial fluidity and options at their disposal.      I have always chosen roles that I believed in - not ones that I thought might further my career.      I don\'t shop. I haven\'t shopped in about four years.      You ask any actor - they\'ll tell you they\'d rather shoot on location because you don\'t have to invent the energy, the energy is there.      What is important is family, friends, giving back to your community and finding meaning in life.      Tabloids can be fun. I see stuff sometimes and have a good laugh.      Secondly, love and relationships are complicated. No one could ever get it right in a four-line sentence.      Once you get into the habit of work, you can be more productive in the things you want to do.      Well, obviously I\'m not Mark Wahlberg - I have much better abs and I look much better in a pair of Calvin Kleins but when I saw Mark Wahlberg interacting with the world, I realised that his stardom was sort of a result of the movies he had done and the publicity that he had got and the work that he did.      I think winter wear is communal. You get some gloves and a scarf from a lost-and-found box, wash them, wear them for a while until you lose them. Then somebody else does the same thing.      I think anybody who\'s famous has to deal with their fame in their own way, and I dealt with it by making a film about a kid who\'s looking out into the world of celebrity obsession.      I have a bunch of concepts and ideas that I want to do but I have also been growing my production company in general and looking to branch out of projects that I am directing and producing.      Because when you go out, and you have fun, basically you\'re performing for these tabloid outlets and the paparazzi. And when you perform and create this story, they\'re chuffed - they get excited, they capture it, and they put it out.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['\nSarah Michelle Gellar ', '""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 165 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(2)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(91)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(61)\xa0|Salary\xa0(6)  Overview (3)Date of Birth14\xa0April1977,\xa0New York City, New York, USA NicknamesSassySMG    Height5\'\xa04""\xa0(1.63\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Emmy Award-winning Sarah Michelle Gellar was born on April 14, 1977 in New York City, the daughter of Rosellen (Greenfield), who taught at a nursery school, and Arthur Gellar, who worked in the garment industry.

I don\'t have a father. I would never give him the credit or acknowledge him as my father.      [on being a teen idol] This is what I\'ve waited for my whole life.      [High school] My biggest complaint is school when it\'s Send-the-roses day. Somebody\'s always left out. I always got roses, but I would give them to someone who hadn\'t gotten any.      [Horror Movies] I\'m always the one who gets killed. And I want it to be really gory. Body parts all over the place. Mangled!      [on Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon]: ""They\'re unbelievable. They\'re an inspiration to young love.""      [on job pressures] There\'s so much pressure on all of us right now. On Katie Holmes, on James Van Der Beek and myself, to do these movies, and do as much as you can because there is the slight feeling that one day your phone will stop ringing. It\'s not about the craft, per se. It\'s so easy to fall for it all because people remind you constantly that as fast as it comes, it can go. And I think there is this sort of paranoia, this need to keep working. And I know that I felt it, and for the first three years of the show, I never had more than a week off, except for Christmas. That was it.      [on being \'skinny\'] How can women be as thin as we are? We have personal trainers to work us out. We have specially prepared meals.      [on the Internet] I got a computer and I\'m learning how to use it. I collect antique books, so I used it to get my copy of \'Les Liaisons Dangereuses,\' and I use it for travel, to look up customs. I went to Fiji, and I looked up all this stuff before I went, like \'Don\'t wear a hat in someone\'s house because it\'s rude, and don\'t wear shoes.\' You\'ve got to think there\'s something better I can do with my time than log on to the Internet and say, \'Ooo, let\'s find out about me!\' I think that would frighten me a little bit.      [on what the word ""feminist"" means] I don\'t call myself a feminist because feminism has a negative connotation. It makes you think of women who don\'t shave their legs. But feminism is not just about not being weak. It\'s about being able to take care of yourself. Just because you might care about what you look like or what the opposite sex thinks of you, it doesn\'t make you not a feminist, although it\'s a word I hate. Do I consider myself a strong female individual? Uh-huh. Can I take care of myself? Yes.      [on her kissing scene with Selma Blair in Cruel Intentions (1999)] It was a great kiss. It even had a saliva trail.      One of the greatest gifts my job has given me is that my mother, who gave up her entire life for me, doesn\'t have to work any more. I\'m now in a position to repay her for her devotion.      I am militant about drugs. You want to do \'em? You\'re out of my life.      [on posing nude] Right now I can\'t picture posing, but I don\'t believe in saying never... There might be a time when I got pregnant and felt really beautiful and wanted to have a nude picture.      [on what she would do if she wasn\'t acting] I would go to college to be a journalist. I always wanted to write for Time or Newsweek.      You\'ll never know what you\'re capable of if you don\'t try.      I don\'t understand why James Bond has to be a man all the time. When Pierce Brosnan retires, why not one of us?      [on why she was happy to get married:] I\'m so grateful I don\'t have to go looking for a man on a Saturday night. I was always terrible at chatting up men. [December 10, 2003]      [about Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997)] To me, the scariest elements of horror films are the things that could really happen. And what is more scary than high school? ... What I like about the show is that it reminds you it\'s O.K. to be different. What people think isn\'t necessarily true. If people walk away with half of that, we\'ve done our job. [New York Times, April 27, 1997]      [on playing Kendall Hart on All My Children (1970)] I seduced my stepfather, and when he wouldn\'t sleep with me, I slept with the stable boy, cried rape, and my mother stabbed him with a letter opener. Then I went to jail for perjury, burned my parents\' divorce papers, and locked up my little sister. I think that was all in the first week. [New York Times, April 27, 1997]      [on attending the Professional Children\'s High School in Manhattan] Everybody there had a talent, and everyone was respected. If somebody didn\'t like you -- they didn\'t talk to you! They didn\'t make fun of you, punish you. You could, you know, mess around with how you dress. You really had that chance to find yourself, and I thank God for that school. I went to that school feeling amazingly untalented. That school was my lifeline. Let me tell you something -- talent night at our school? There was nothing like it.      Horror films are where women can shine and have a chance to lead. They always save the day in these films.      [on gay marriage] I have good friends, gay couples, who\'ve been together for 18 years. It drives me crazy that in the eyes of the law, their love isn\'t acknowledged when I have girlfriends who have married four times by the age of 25.      [on religion] I don\'t believe in organized religion and I never have.      No, that\'s what bothers me. That\'s how they think. Okay, this is a summer...I remember that it used to be you could see great movies any time. Now it\'s like summer is for blockbusters, fall is for the movies that they can\'t fit into any other time, that\'s like September. Then Oscar movies start, it used to be post Thanksgiving. Now the awards are earlier so it starts earlier. January is when they dump movies. And it\'s just so... it seems to me so obvious that wouldn\'t it be better for the marketplace to have these movies spread out? Not just people don\'t only go to the movies in summer time. If that was the truth, then in the summer time they would count the whole week\'s worth of the box office but it\'s still only a weekend. So why does it matter...sorry, I get a little upset. It\'s just frustrating.      Basically I only like to choose films that I don\'t understand. As long as they\'re greater than my mental capacity, I figure I gotta be doing something artful, right? Isn\'t that what makes something art when you don\'t understand it?      I wish, and I wish so much for the film industry right now. I wish so much for originality and I wish so much and I think that we\'re caught in this difficult cycle right now because our studios are corporations now. I keep talking about the old 1940s, where one guy with a cigar and a scotch made decisions for a studio and now, because there are all these computer corporations basically, technology companies and there\'s so much else that goes into a decision that it\'s very difficult to get films that are different, that are off the beaten path, made. It\'s much easier to get something unoriginal made than to get something original.      ""Simply Irresistible (1999) was just a bad choice - and for that it was a great learning experience. I wasn\'t ready to make that movie. I was too young. The script was not ready. I knew in my heart before I left to make it that I should back out"".      [on how she would like Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997) and her work on it to be remembered] I hope positively. One thing about the show was it was never categorized. It was drama, comedy, action, horror, all of those things combined. And I just want people to remember it as a fabulous run, a fabulous seven years.      In this day and age, everything is so cross-marketed that the lines have blurred, in my opinion, between what is an actor and what is a celebrity. What is reality? All you have to do is pick up a magazine or turn on the television and you can get ideas from places that five years ago you couldn\'t.      [Working in LA filming Southland Tales (2006)] That\'s so weird. It\'s one of those things that\'s like you go on location and you\'re there for a week getting ready. Here it\'s like you\'re walking the dog, you\'re paying the bills and then 10 minutes later, you have to go to work. It\'s a very sort of odd- - I\'m grateful for it and so glad to actually film a movie in Hollywood. Although some of these locations are pretty far. I could probably fly to some of them.      [on her doing movies and Freddie Prinze Jr. doing his show] It\'s funny in the sense of he\'ll say to me, \'You don\'t understand. You\'re doing a movie. I\'ve been on my feet all day.\' I\'m like, \'For real? For real I don\'t understand?\' So that\'s kind of odd. And the times are funny because I\'m on nights and he\'s more organized in terms of...or last week he was getting out of the house at like 3:30 in the morning.      [Her advice for her husband, Freddie Prinze Jr. on his sitcom Freddie (2005)] Do a sitcom. Don\'t do a one hour. That was actually my advice. He was going to do a one hour. I was like, \'Are you crazy? You know what people make for sitcoms and how little they work, right? You see all of our friends on sitcoms.      You know what? I only see myself doing films that interest me and that are a little bit off the beaten path. I will go wherever that takes me. I just - - I always say it just can\'t be generic. I can\'t be the girlfriend or the wife or the - - you can\'t play the characters that I\'ve been blessed to play and then do that. I can\'t be the girl in the film.      I think the best piece of advice I\'ve ever gotten is to trust myself and go for my dreams. I got that from my mom.      Being sexy is being confident. It\'s important to know you don\'t have to have silicone breasts falling out and a thigh-high skirt. Sometimes you meet people and they think, \'Another cute little blonde actress.\' That\'s not who I am. - on rather being known as clever than sexy.      [on not wanting children at this point] You can\'t be selfish and have a child. Right now I want to live my life and have fun. I want to go sit in my Jacuzzi and drink wine all night. [December 2007]      I had to twist his [Freddie\'s] arm and leg to see Moulin Rouge! (2001) Although he enjoyed it once we were there. In fact, there was a moment during the evening when I swear I thought he was going to leave me for Nicole Kidman but then, who could blame him? I\'d probably leave him for Nicole if she asked. She\'s hot!      It sounds clichéd, but when women turn 30 they find themselves. You become more comfortable in your own skin. Last night on Letterman I wore this skintight Herve Ledger dress. Two years ago, three years ago? I would never have worn it. - Gothman Magazine.      [on her character Buffy Summers] For eight years I had the pleasure of portraying a character that was the very definition of a powerful woman. In my opinion, one of the greatest examples in the history of entertainment. [2007]      As an actor, you constantly play these other characters. You\'re always pretending to be somebody else, but at the same time you have to keep a handle on who you are. I think that\'s where a lot of actresses get lost sometimes, because that\'s tough. I can only imagine it has to be the same as a pop star because you\'re not even playing a character. You\'re a persona.      [After having her baby girl Charlotte] I\'m not going back to work anytime soon. I\'ll only have my first child once and see these milestones once. I can\'t imagine not being there. We\'re (she and husband Freddie Prinze Jr.) just taking it one day at a time. I\'m such a cliché right now, but she is the greatest gift that anyone has ever given me, and I will spend the rest of my life doing everything I can to do right by her. What still overwhelms me is the reality that we created this life together, and now we are responsible for her. She is here; she is ours. I\'d say that makes us pretty lucky, indeed. [November 2009]      [on the suggestion of a \'Buffy\' film, 2004] \'My concern with a film is, how can we do it justice? We went out on top, and I like staying there. That doesn\'t mean I won\'t change my mind. I\'m a woman. It\'s my prerogative to change my mind as often as I like!\'      [on working with Seth Green] \'If I had my way, I\'d work with Seth on every project. I think the world of him...he\'s an amazingly gifted comedian and he\'s also a very giving comedian.\'      [on a possible Buffy reboot movie] It was a movie! It\'s been made. It stars Kristy Swanson, they made it! They don\'t need to make another one. I think it\'s a horrible idea to try to do a Buffy without Joss Whedon, I mean that\'s like honestly...to be incredibly non-eloquent, that\'s the dumbest idea I ever heard.      [on the importance of reading] I love books. I\'m constantly afraid we\'re moving into this digital era where books are going to go away, and to me books are the basis to everything in life. Reading is how we function. It\'s not just creative imagination and creative play, it\'s how we function as human beings, as human adults, and if you can instill that at a young age then that\'s a skill they\'ll have for life.      [looking back on Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997)] I think it\'s gotten me to this point now where I don\'t have this burning desire to accomplish anything. That was so fulfilling for me in every way that everything I do now is the cherry on top. I don\'t feel the pressure to do this or have to do this or go here or do that because I feel like I\'ve already won.      [on enjoying working, but not letting it take over her life] I was 18 years old when I started ""Buffy,"" and work was my everything. Back then, no actor had worse hours than I did. Now I don\'t work on weekends anymore. Everybody knows you can\'t sway me on that point, so nobody even tries. Plus, my perspective on work has changed: Work doesn\'t define who I am. I love what I do, but I don\'t feel a burning pressure anymore. And because I\'m working for fun, I get to enjoy it. I\'d watch Ringer (2011) if I wasn\'t on it! Of course, it\'s not as much fun when you know what\'s going to happen. It takes some of the excitement away.      [on how having a child has changed her perspective on work] I would never fault anyone\'s decisions and choices, but being a parent was so important to me. I just couldn\'t be the parent who goes from country to country and leaves their child, or schleps their child with them.      [on finding it difficult to understand people who view returning to TV after strictly working in film is a step down career-wise] I don\'t feel like I didn\'t succeed - The Grudge (2004) is still the second-highest female opening ever. And Ringer (2011) doesn\'t feel like a retrograde step, not to me. That is the weird perception, but I think it\'s slowly changing.      [on whether or not she is fed up with looking back and talking about Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997)] Fed up with it? No! No, no, no! I\'m so proud of it, and I actually like talking about it more now than I did then. Because I was 19, 20. Sometimes I think, to get true perspective, you have to step away, to realize the impact that something had.      [on how Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997) affected the course of television] ""Buffy"" came at the right time ... Now you see these great roles on television all the time. Glenn Close in Damages (2007)? One of the greatest actresses of all time. Sally Field in Brothers & Sisters (2006)? TV is where the roles are. Without wishing to sound obnoxious, I do think it changed the course of television. It certainly changed genre television. It just came at the right time for that.      I clip coupons all the time. Why should you pay more for something that someone else is paying less for?      Relationships are like flowers: They need attention to grow and develop. You have to make time to be there for the other person.      I kiss other girls, sure, but that doesn\'t make me a lesbian. Does it? I mean, I read \'\'Playgirl\'\'.      [on quitting Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997)] You always worry about being the show that\'s been on too long especially when you\'re a cult hit. Last year, a lot of people were ready to tear us down. So when we started to have such a strong year this year, I thought, \'\'This is how I want to go out on top, at our best.\'\' I was 18 when I started the show; I\'m 26. I\'m married. I never see my husband. This has been the longest span of my life in one place. There\'ve been times where that\'s been difficult, you want to pick up and go, try other things, live in different places. It feels right, and you have to listen to that. The show, as we know it, is over. I love this job, I love the fans. I love telling the stories we tell. This isn\'t about leaving for a career in movies, or in theater, it\'s more of a personal decision. I need a rest. Teachers get sabbaticals. Actors don\'t.      [on The Crazy Ones (2013)] James Wolk is a star. Like I said to Robin, \'Its great that you\'re Robin Williams and you\'re great and you\'re funny, but Jimmy Wolk is stealing this entire show from you. Like, watch out      [on being called Buffy] Back then, if you\'d called me Buffy I would probably have been really annoyed. Now, of course, I get it and I\'m appreciative of it. But that\'s something that comes with maturity, which most people don\'t have when they\'re 24 years old.      I\'ve definitely smoked cigarettes, and I\'ve partied plenty. I just got it out of my system early. I was lucky enough to have had my experiences when I was younger - and out of the public eye. When I was younger, I was very careful not to... I just didn\'t want to be seen with a drink in my hand. People looked up to Buffy, and she was a character that girls respected.      [on motherhood] For me, having a child was that cliched, life-altering experience where everything took on a different meaning. Things that had once been priorities had no meaning to me anymore, and things that I\'d never thought about suddenly became things that were on my mind. If I\'d known how happy having a child would make me, I probably would have had one a long time ago.      I got locked out of our new house a few days ago without any shoes on and ended up bloodying and scraping the bottom of my feet. I kind of scaled a wall thinking I was still a 22-year-old superhero.

She is an actress, known for Big Daddy (1999), Dazed and Confused (1993) and The Break-Up (2006).Trade Mark (1)        Her voiceTrivia (13)      Filmed a scene for Wayne\'s World 2 (1993), but her scene was later deleted during editing.      Is a fan of country music and wrote the song she sings in Chasing Amy (1997).      Won the Chicago Film Critics ""Most Promising Actress"" award in 1997 for her performance in Chasing Amy (1997).      Moved to Hollywood in 1988.      Often mistaken for Renée Zellweger. During her appearance on Dinner for Five (2001) she said the person who most-often makes that mistake is Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein.      When her brother was in a coma from an automobile accident, he would only show a response from her very distinctive voice.      She has worked with both of the London twins. She starred in Dazed and Confused (1993) with Jason London and two years later in Mallrats (1995) with Jeremy London.      Good friend of Ashley Judd.      Moved after 19 years from Los Angeles to Oxford, Mississippi. [2006]      Arrested on suspicion of drunk driving in San Diego [December 2003]      Wrote and directed the film, Come Early Morning (2006), selected from 1700 submissions that is among 16 that will play and premiere in Sundance\'s U.S. dramatic competition. [November 2005]      She played Jason London\'s girlfriend in Dazed and Confused (1993) and his identical twin brother Jeremy London\'s ex-girlfriend in Mallrats (1995). Coincidentally, Ben Affleck appeared in both films.      She appeared in four films with Ben Affleck: Dazed and Confused (1993), Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997) and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001). The first of these, which was directed by Richard Linklater, was the only one of the four not directed by Kevin Smith.Personal Quotes (19)      [on her distinctive voice] It\'s not a normal voice. It doesn\'t fit into people\'s preconceptions about what a woman\'s voice should sound like. My mom doesn\'t think I have an unusual voice, though. I\'m sure it\'s helped me get some roles. But Chasing Amy (1997), I almost didn\'t get. There was concern the voice would grate on some people -- which some critics said it did.      \'Chasing Amy\' was an amazing role, but then after that, I went and did \'Big Daddy\' and you\'re the girlfriend or you\'re the best friend. I wasn\'t getting the Nicole Kidman roles.      There were days that I literally had no reason to get out of bed. It just was so destructive for me.      The last person they expected to connect with a screenplay was the comedic, blonde actress with the funny voice.      It\'s not like you can wake up and realize, \'Oh, I want intimacy,\' and then it happens that day.      I was never one of those people who thought, \'What I really want to do is direct.\' It never occurred to me.      I think, ultimately, looking back now, acting wasn\'t satisfying me 100%.      I like decorative, functional things that I feel comfortable in.      I am one of the few actresses who isn\'t recognized by the way she looks. I\'m recognized by the way I talk.      For women in their 30s, it\'s so hard to get good parts.      Definition of an independent film is torture with less money and time.      A bonus: You don\'t have to diet to direct.      My relationship with my father is pretty non-existent.      I don\'t think I was fully satisfied acting. You know, the girlfriend role or the best friend role, and that wasn\'t enough for me.      A genius is one who can do anything except make a living.      I want to feel passion, I want to feel pain. I want to weep at the sound of your name. Come make me laugh, come make me cry... just make me feel alive.      No one was jumping up and saying, \'Yeah, let me give you money.\' I had never held a camera in my hand - a home video camera, nothing. I had not directed.      My life isn\'t that dramatic. My dad really loves me, he just can\'t talk on the phone. He\'s too crippled and shy, and that\'s almost harder. He\'s there and he loves me, and I try and try and try, it\'s just impossible to have a relationship.      It just gets frustrating playing the girlfriend, It\'s just this awful feeling, sitting in your house, waiting for a script to come.

Worked as a production assistant on the films Say Anything... (1989) and Illegally Yours (1988) to learn from the famed first assistant director Jerry Ziesmer about the production side of filmmaking.      Is a vegetarian.      He was cast as Marty McFly in Back to the Future (1985) after Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale were unable to get Michael J. Fox, their first choice for the part due to scheduling conflicts. After only five weeks of filming, he was let go from the film because Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale felt he was ""too intense"" for the character. Michael J. Fox, who was then available, took over the part.      Was nominated for Broadway\'s 1989 Tony Award as Best Actor (Featured Role - Play) for a revival of Thornton Wilder\'s Great Performances: Our Town (1989).      Spent three months in a wheelchair in preparation for his role in the film The Waterdance (1992).      Lived in American Samoa for a few years as a child.      According to a 1992 Movieline Interview, the casting agents for Mask (1985) had refused to let him in to read for the part. When he had finally finagled his way into an audition via a sympathetic receptionist, he arrived for his big chance before the casting people wearing a stocking over his face. And he got the part. Now he really put the technique to work. Reportedly he also insisted on being called Rocky, never Eric. But he went further than that. ""I walked around town with the mask on. It was important to get people\'s reactions in grocery stores and post offices and see what they would say when they saw me strolling down the street. I just wanted to get an idea of how Rocky may have felt, which was horrible. People were generally cruel and mean. They would make snide comments. Kids threw things at me. People took pictures and asked, \'Hey, are you in the circus?\'"".

Was considered for the role of Detective Vic Mackey on The Shield (2002).Personal Quotes (13)      It\'s hard not to get a big head in the film industry, there are people on a set paid to cater to your every need, from the minute you arrive until you go home. It\'s kind of strange, but not unpleasant.      I\'m interested in doing movies I wouldn\'t normally be interested in doing.      I realize I\'m a very lucky man. I love what I do, I love films, tv and theater, and the fact that I\'m able to make a living at it staggers me.      There\'s a strange sense of accomplishment in making an independent film. Everything\'s against you; there\'s no time, and even less money- you bring a bottle of glue, chip in twenty bucks, and hope you all make it through the day. If you manage to finish it and it actually turns out to be pretty good, it\'s thrilling.      I find that there are two kinds of actors (or actresses) that you work with constantly: (1) The Respectful Actor. This person is kind and giving and talented and fun to work with and respectful of your relationship. (2) The Predatory Actor. This person is kind and giving and talented and fun to work with but feels that because they are famous they don\'t have to function within society\'s rules, i.e., if they are hungry, they eat; if they are attracted to their co-star, they act on it, married or not, no matter what destruction may ensue. These people obviously should be in therapy.      To go from trying to steer a scene to trying to bring it to life from within is a big difference. Directing has only increased my admiration and respect for what it is that actors do. (On going from directing to acting on \'Grey\'s Anatomy\'.)      (1992, on Memphis Belle (1990)) Michael Caton-Jones was a little twisted. He had us spend three weeks running five miles a day with packs on our back and sleeping with 20 other smelly, grumpy guys. I think he wanted to see spoiled Hollywood actors tortured and beaten down so he could come in and direct. After boot camp we were putty in his hands. He wore a general\'s cap on the set and occasionally walked around with a riding crop. He\'s a good director, but his sense of humor is obviously strange.      (1992, on Haunted Summer (1988)) Actually, Laura Dern got me that role. She brought me the script and told me that I should meet the director. Ivan Passer took us to dinner and offered me the role. Some directors just want to hire you after getting a sense of who you are and others want you to read a million times. Either way is fine with me. Although it\'s a lot more fun to just go out to dinner...We lived this sort of bohemian existence during that film. We thought of those people as the rock and roll stars of their day, young, hedonistic people pursuing anarchic lifestyles, shocking society. We were all passionate about it. I already had a knowledge of the Romantic poets, but I didn\'t know much about (my character) Shelley. So I read every book about his life. I read this man\'s mail. I went to the places he went. I had a great time. I remember one night on Lake Como when there was an incredible thunderstorm. All the power went out in our hotel. I went out on the balcony and saw Laura and Philip Anglim on a balcony, and Alex Winter on the balcony next to them, watching the lightning. And I thought, this was what life should be like.      (1992, on his preparation for The Wild Life (1984)) I got a job at a bowling alley, moved into Oakwood Apartments in Burbank and tried to live that life. It was awful. I had to clean other people\'s shoes, deal with women\'s bowling day. The time really dragged. On one level, it was no fun at all but, on another level, it was real interesting. I had the opportunity to hang out in the apartment complex\'s clubhouse and down by the pool. The place was filled with recently divorced people who were licking their wounds. I did that for two months. And, ultimately, it did make it easier to do the character.      (1992, on his early love with Ally Sheedy. Source: Movieline) We met in history class. Neither of us were acting [in films] at the time. We were just kids in college. We lived together in a commune on Hollywood Boulevard. It was a huge old Victorian house called the Harris Hollywood House, and there were four or five rooms filled with ex-patriots from England, a handful of homeless people, lots of young, aspiring actors. It was cheap and the atmosphere was exciting. It was a wonderful, messy, fervent time filled with crazy people starting their careers and very excited about what might happen. (http://movieline.com/1992/06/01/eric-stoltz-true-confessions-of-a-faux-paraplegic/)      (1992) My parents moved to American Samoa when I was three or four years old. My dad was principal of a high school there. It was idyllic for a kid. I had a whole island for a backyard. I lived there until I was eight years old and we moved to Santa Barbara. That was a rough transition to make. I remember being the only kid in second grade who couldn\'t tie his shoelaces, because I had never worn shoes on the island.      (1992, on The Waterdance (1992)) The role required a lot of research. I spent every day for three or four months at the hospital, never getting out of the wheelchair. I would have lived there, but there aren\'t enough beds as it is.      (1992, on being private) I\'m in one of the most public professions in existence. But I\'ve always felt that the less you know about an actor\'s personal life, the more you can get involved in the story in which he\'s playing a character. And I don\'t like to see movies where you know about everything that happens behind the scenes. I can\'t engage in the story if I know what\'s going on in the actor\'s head. I don\'t want to see the zipper in the back of the monster suit. Like everybody else who goes to the movies, I want to believe the monster is real.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","['Cindy Bandolini', '""Cindy is a Massachusetts mobster\'s daughter.""']","['Kelly Morgan', '""""']","[[<bound method Tag.get_text of <p>

This low budget offering from disturbed filmmaker James Toback (""Black and
White"") features Adrian Grenier as a Harvard University basketball player in
money trouble who is conned by his shaddy girlfriend (Sarah Michelle Gellar
(playing a rif on her ""Cruel Intentions"" role) to throw a basketball game
for money. Add in subplots about the mob, a couple of shaddy FBI agents
(including a weird performance by Eric Stoltz), a teacher he has an affair
with (Joey Lauren Adams) and a bizare drug trip segment and you have.. a
typical Toback picture.. Still, the performances, especialy by relative
newcommer Grenier are excellent and the story is weird enough to keep you
fascinated.. Not for all tastes due to its subject matter but a good film.

This movie had so many chances to be comedic, dramatic and even
interesting, but just failed on so many levels. In some instances the
actors were so ""acting"" that it was just unbelievable. Nothing good
here. Joey Lauren Adams is just good to listen to because she is a bit
sexy. Hell it is so bad that I just saw the end and I can't remember
how it ended... I had to make this comment at least 10 lines for it to
be posted. Now, you have to know that I am just writing to get it
posted. This is how bad this movie was. If you get stoned or do some
LSD, it just might be your cup of tea. If you have the brain power to
dissect the movie. Even then, don't expect too much.

If I were to express my true views of this film, it would not be
allowed on the internet. Totally egregious, a travesty, a cinematic
endeavour that has successfully set humanity back at least 30 years. I
just can't understand what possibly possessed this guy to make this
film, let alone for Buffy to star in it. Not to mention its racism.
Evidently, black people don't go to harvard, but if they do, rest
assured that they play basketball and carry guns!Besides the only two
blacks in the film were a gun toting roommate and a nymphomaniac
neighbourwith designs on the two white protagonists, all that was
missing was to have them eat some fried chicken and have grills. I am
lost for words. Let me use some pseudo-deep philosophy to ponder it,
similarly to Kirkegaard, as would be said in the film. I really hope
that as many people as possible watch this film and consider how its
release was ever made possible. Honestly, why did his black Harvard
roommate attack him with a gun???

The beginning of this movie is weak, and overly simplistic, especially the
early scenes with the Cindy's father. The most amusing part is the fling
in
the forest, where Sarah Michelle Gellar's sexiness is notable.
However, it gets better. You feel the guy's confusion in his head, his
mindset, and the overall suspense picks up.
The biggest disappointment is it ends abruptly. The plot could have been
carried on even further, I believe.

I have seen "" HARVARD MAN "" for the first time on dvd and i think it is a
notable failure with a great cast.<br><br>James Toback is a good director but this is not one of his best films
simply
it is poorly written and directed and it gives the cast nothing to do
whatsoever.<br><br>Adam Greiner is ok if a little wooden but he gets completely out acted by
the utterly gorgeous and totally wonderfull Sarah Michelle Gellar as the
nasty and calculated Cindy.<br><br>The rest of the cast...Rebecca Gayheart,Ray Allen and,good to see him in
a
movie after all these years,Eric Stoltz are excellent but as i have said
they are not given much to do.<br><br>So in short...notable failure that could have been good.

So...Joey Lauren Adams is this professor in philosphy......With that
voice????<br><br>It somehow didn't seem right to me. At least we've learned about the
dangers
of drugs. Before you can say LSD, you're entangled in a web of deceit,
with
both the FBI and the mafia on your tail. No use to get philosophical about
it, just say no. As Buffy would say: 'cos it's Wrong!!!

The movie has an unintentionally ridiculous plot involving tri-sexual
FBI agents, mobsters, a hot blonde philosophy professor, high stakes
gambling, a natural disaster, and a cameo appearance by Al Franken.
Interspersed with these things are characters tripping on drugs or
philosophizing as college freshmen do, at great length.<br><br>Leading man Adrian Grenier has gotten handsomer since he made this
movie; he grew into his looks. He did a good job acting, especially
considering how young he appears to be here and the oddness of the
material.<br><br>I was expecting the movie to be more offensive because the director has
a reputation for doing unspeakable things to females in life, and given
his other movies. This movie just appears to be a drug-fueled,
delusional, freshman fantasy, but not as enjoyable as that sounds.<br><br>The fact that this director was given several movies to direct after
this, each more offensive than the next, is disturbing.<br><br>Notes for the sensitive: The movie opens with footage from a sex scene
and there are several more throughout. Plenty of drug usage too. <br><br>Some people have commented on the oddness of the colors in the movie
but I just saw it on Showtime and found those to be normal, except for
the brown river water in Boston. Maybe the colors were corrected or

I am a fan of the offbeat independent genre of filmmaking and I found this
to be a rather interesting entry into it. I really like morality tales but I
feel a bit ripped when the ending doesn't end with a crash and burn (much
like Risky Business or The Graduate). What does save this movie is the first
ninety percent of it. Here are my reasons (some spoilers contained within):
(1) I loved the sharp dialogue in this movie. Some of the lines that I heard
throughout the film I will probably remember for quite sometime. (2) Adrien
Grenier's performance was excellent and the best in the film. Seeing him go
through that acid trip was enough for me to recommend him for an acting
award. The words ""Oscar Clip"" should have been blinking at the bottom of the
screen. (3) Sarah Michelle Gellar was enticingly evil as Grenier's
boyfriend. Even her alter-ego would probably want to stab a stake in her
heart. (4) The acid trip sequence is about as messed up as any sequence I
have ever seen in a movie. As I saw Eric Stoltz's face become visually
distorted, I felt like I had dropped acid myself. (5) The philosophical
value in this movie is about as heavy as gold. I love it when movies inject
philosophy into the plot of a film because the film is then acknowledging
that something is supposed to be learned by watching it and therefore it
isn't stupid. Most mass-produced movies don't have this phenomenon. (6) The
most surprising aspect of the movie goes to Al Franken. He is the last
person that I would ever expect to do a cameo in the movie and I don't think
his talent was wasted or misplaced. (7) This is the second movie I have ever
seen by James Toback and I found his style of filmmaking to be an acquired
taste (much like that of Paul Thomas Anderson). He did a splendid job
directing this movie however. (8) I found the choppy cinematography to a
blessing. If the cinematography hadn't matched the somewhat choppy story to
begin with, it would have sank even farther in my mind. Eight reasons give a
score of eight.<br><br>The downers I thought were (1) the choppy editing and (2) that sad excuse
for a denouement and I believe they are interlocked. Granted the editing was
rather sub-par I believe, it was needed to accomodate the screenplay. In
order not to blow anything at all, they need to cut and paste it in that
manner but the job was unfit anyway. I blame the denouement for that, if
there had been a nice crash and burn at the end (much like Donnie Darko and
The Dangerous Lives Of Altar Boys) the film wouldn't have been so choppy to
begin with. All movies that are made to send a strong moral should have the
character suffer a big loss in his or her life that they have to live with
forever. Granted the ending does have some of that, it didn't really pay off
in that manner and I felt a little cheated.<br><br>Overall, I found ""Harvard Man"" to be an engrossing and disturbing film that
interlocks philosophy, drug use, and crime into almost nicely wrapped

I love Sarah Michelle Gellar, she is capable of fantastic acting as
made clear in the Buffy series. She has, unfortunately, been given no
opportunities to show her considerable talent in film. While Cruel
Intentions is a bad movie, Harvard Man is one of the worst - if not the
worst - movie I have ever forced myself to sit through. The writing is
practically non-existent. There are many scenes of back and forth
dialogue with little purpose but to fill time. There are several
simultaneous plots (gambling, drug addiction, sexual cheating, dealing
with the mob), none of them interesting in their execution. There is no
coherence - each plot thread seems forced in to fill time and is not
interwoven with a big theme. One soon gets the feeling that the movie
was started with little passion from the director, then finished in a
hurry to meet a deadline. Harvard Man is transparently what it is: a
quickly-made attempt to capitalize on Gellar's fame. To watch it is to
wait for its end, amazed that such a thing actually made it as a major
motion picture. I CAN'T believe the average rating here is close to 5.
Anyone who says this movie is anything but awful is either mentally
deficient or has an agenda. The only reason to watch this movie is to
gawk at its atrociousness.

Alan Jensen (Adrian Grenier) is the star basketball player at Harvard.
They're not that good in a league nobody cares about other than
gamblers. His girlfriend Cindy Bandolini (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is the
daughter of a mob boss. He's also sleeping with his philosophy
professor Chesney Cort (Joey Lauren Adams). Alan's parents lose their
home in a tornado. Cindy offers him a way to make money fast by shaving
points. Instead of her father, she borrows money from her father's
associates Teddy Carter (Eric Stoltz) and Kelly Morgan (Rebecca
Gayheart). Unbeknownst to her, they're actually FBI agents.<br><br>The visual style and dialog mannerisms overwhelm the plot. The
classical music, quick paced speaking patterns, and camera work leaves
this struggling to flow properly. It never has a chance to breathe. The
actors are good for a more natural style but they're not great enough
to pull this off. The movie is simply trying too hard.

This low budget offering from disturbed filmmaker James Toback (""Black and
White"") features Adrian Grenier as a Harvard University basketball player in
money trouble who is conned by his shaddy girlfriend (Sarah Michelle Gellar
(playing a rif on her ""Cruel Intentions"" role) to throw a basketball game
for money. Add in subplots about the mob, a couple of shaddy FBI agents
(including a weird performance by Eric Stoltz), a teacher he has an affair
with (Joey Lauren Adams) and a bizare drug trip segment and you have.. a
typical Toback picture.. Still, the performances, especialy by relative
newcommer Grenier are excellent and the story is weird enough to keep you
fascinated.. Not for all tastes due to its subject matter but a good film.
GRADE: B

This movie had so many chances to be comedic, dramatic and even
interesting, but just failed on so many levels. In some instances the
actors were so ""acting"" that it was just unbelievable. Nothing good
here. Joey Lauren Adams is just good to listen to because she is a bit
sexy. Hell it is so bad that I just saw the end and I can't remember
how it ended... I had to make this comment at least 10 lines for it to
be posted. Now, you have to know that I am just writing to get it
posted. This is how bad this movie was. If you get stoned or do some
LSD, it just might be your cup of tea. If you have the brain power to
dissect the movie. Even then, don't expect too much.

If I were to express my true views of this film, it would not be
allowed on the internet. Totally egregious, a travesty, a cinematic
endeavour that has successfully set humanity back at least 30 years. I
just can't understand what possibly possessed this guy to make this
film, let alone for Buffy to star in it. Not to mention its racism.
Evidently, black people don't go to harvard, but if they do, rest
assured that they play basketball and carry guns!Besides the only two
blacks in the film were a gun toting roommate and a nymphomaniac
neighbourwith designs on the two white protagonists, all that was
missing was to have them eat some fried chicken and have grills. I am
lost for words. Let me use some pseudo-deep philosophy to ponder it,
similarly to Kirkegaard, as would be said in the film. I really hope
that as many people as possible watch this film and consider how its
release was ever made possible. Honestly, why did his black Harvard
roommate attack him with a gun???
</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>

The beginning of this movie is weak, and overly simplistic, especially the
early scenes with the Cindy's father. The most amusing part is the fling
in
the forest, where Sarah Michelle Gellar's sexiness is notable.
However, it gets better. You feel the guy's confusion in his head, his
mindset, and the overall suspense picks up.
The biggest disappointment is it ends abruptly. The plot could have been
carried on even further, I believe.

I have seen "" HARVARD MAN "" for the first time on dvd and i think it is a
notable failure with a great cast.<br><br>James Toback is a good director but this is not one of his best films
simply
it is poorly written and directed and it gives the cast nothing to do
whatsoever.<br><br>Adam Greiner is ok if a little wooden but he gets completely out acted by
the utterly gorgeous and totally wonderfull Sarah Michelle Gellar as the
nasty and calculated Cindy.<br><br>The rest of the cast...Rebecca Gayheart,Ray Allen and,good to see him in
a
movie after all these years,Eric Stoltz are excellent but as i have said
they are not given much to do.<br><br>So in short...notable failure that could have been good.

So...Joey Lauren Adams is this professor in philosphy......With that
voice????<br><br>It somehow didn't seem right to me. At least we've learned about the
dangers
of drugs. Before you can say LSD, you're entangled in a web of deceit,
with
both the FBI and the mafia on your tail. No use to get philosophical about
it, just say no. As Buffy would say: 'cos it's Wrong!!!

The movie has an unintentionally ridiculous plot involving tri-sexual
FBI agents, mobsters, a hot blonde philosophy professor, high stakes
gambling, a natural disaster, and a cameo appearance by Al Franken.
Interspersed with these things are characters tripping on drugs or
philosophizing as college freshmen do, at great length.<br><br>Leading man Adrian Grenier has gotten handsomer since he made this
movie; he grew into his looks. He did a good job acting, especially
considering how young he appears to be here and the oddness of the
material.<br><br>I was expecting the movie to be more offensive because the director has
a reputation for doing unspeakable things to females in life, and given
his other movies. This movie just appears to be a drug-fueled,
delusional, freshman fantasy, but not as enjoyable as that sounds.<br><br>The fact that this director was given several movies to direct after
this, each more offensive than the next, is disturbing.<br><br>Notes for the sensitive: The movie opens with footage from a sex scene
and there are several more throughout. Plenty of drug usage too. <br><br>Some people have commented on the oddness of the colors in the movie
but I just saw it on Showtime and found those to be normal, except for
the brown river water in Boston. Maybe the colors were corrected or
maybe there are colors only some people can see, like dog whistles.
