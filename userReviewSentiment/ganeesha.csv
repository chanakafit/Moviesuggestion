Father, with Susan Sarandon, of Jack Henry Robbins (born May 15, 1989) and Miles Robbins (born May 4, 1992).      Son of musician Gil Robbins and actress Mary Robbins. His father was a member of the folk-music group The Highwaymen.      As co-presenters of the Academy Awards in 1993, he and his former partner, Susan Sarandon, seized a chance to bring public attention to the plight of a few hundred Haitians with AIDS who had been interned in Guant\xe1namo Bay.      Chosen by Empire magazine as one of the 100 Sexiest Stars in film history (#94). [1995]      Was kicked off his high school hockey team for fighting.      A longtime Green Party member (along with partner Susan Sarandon), he was repeatedly criticized by other Hollywood stars for voting for Ralph Nader in the controversial 2000 election. He wrote a small essay about why he made the choice in the August 6, 2001 edition of ""The Nation"", a monthly progressive magazine. [August 2001]      After the September 11 attacks, he tried to fly out of New York City to be with Susan Sarandon and their children in Hollywood. Upon finding out that all flights were grounded, he and a friend drove from New York City to Los Angeles in a 56-hour trip that began on the morning of September 12, 2001.      LA Weekly cover story detailed his struggle taking creative control of the Actors\' Gang, the theater company he founded in 1981. Many longtime members of the group left the company during the controversy. [August 2001]      Considers himself the worlds biggest New York Rangers fan. He claims to own every highlight video released of their 1994 Stanley Cup Championship season. He is also a big New York Mets fan.      Attended anti-war rally in London on February 15, 2003.      Called for Hollywood boycott of Elizabeth Hurley and Proctor & Gamble products in 2000 after she crossed a picket line to make a commercial for a P&G; product. At a pro-union rally in New York he said, ""We\'re bringing her [Hurley] to trial after this is over. She won\'t get away with it!"" Apparently she did ""get away with it"" whatever ""it"" was, since nothing came to pass in the intervening seven years.      Was considered for the role of Dr. Doom in Fantastic Four (2005) and Eddie Darko in Donnie Darko (2001).      At 6\'5"", he is the tallest actor ever to have won an Oscar. The tallest actor ever nominated was James Cromwell at 6\'7"".      During an interview with Charlie Rose regarding the 10-year anniversary of The Shawshank Redemption (1994), he said he regarded that film, Bull Durham (1988), Dead Man Walking (1995), and Mystic River (2003) as the highlights of his career so far.      Graduated with honors from UCLA with a degree in Drama (1981).      Is good friends with John Cusack, in addition to being his co-star in six films: Bob Roberts (1992), Cradle Will Rock (1999), High Fidelity (2000), The Player (1992), The Sure Thing (1985), and Tapeheads (1988).      Apparently ""discovered"" Jack Black, having given him his first film role in Bob Roberts (1992). The two remain good friends today and he has appeared in 3 films with him.      Was considered for the role of Charles Van Doren in Quiz Show (1994), when Steven Soderbergh was offered the opportunity to direct it.      Revealed on The Colbert Report (2005) that of all the movies he\'s made, Bull Durham (1988) is his favorite.      Was in attendance at Chris Penn\'s funeral.      Serves as the artistic director and member of the board of directors of the Actors\' Gang theater company.      Has a brother, David Robbins and sister Adele Robbins.      Admits that he only did Howard the Duck (1986) for the money.      Played in the Boston Bruins Legends Classic Hockey Game (January 2010).      By age 12, he was already a member of the Theater for the New City, an avant-garde acting troupe.      Despite his reputation as a ultra-liberal activist (which has frequently led him to be the target of Republican criticism), Robbins has donated significant amounts of money to Republican, as well as Democratic, candidates for public office. This includes $500.00 he gave to the ultimately successful 2006 U.S. congressional campaign of Michele Bachmann, R-MN, who is a prominent and vocal far-right opponent of nearly every Democratic and liberal proposal and policy.      His favorite movie is the Akira Kurosawa masterpiece Shichinin no samurai (1954).      Became a father for the 1st time at age 30 when his [now ex] partner Susan Sarandon gave birth to their son Jack Henry Robbins on May 15, 1989.

He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on October 10, 2008.Personal Quotes (23)      [on his screenwriting] I always write from an actor\'s perspective, which is writing dialogue that fits comfortably into one\'s mouth, as opposed to dialogue that is strained and defective.      A movie script is a malleable entity when you\'re shooting and should be able to become different things and should be able to be rewritten at the last minute.      I\'m fairly competent as a director and actor, but I am Mr. Neurotic as a writer. I just don\'t have enough confidence in my abilities to take criticism well. I take it personally. Start with \'It\'s a masterpiece,\' and then tell me what you think could be changed.      We have right now a media that is willfully ignoring the high crimes and misdemeanors of the president of the United States. [Bill Clinton] lied about a blowjob and got impeached by the media and Congress. [George W. Bush] got us into the Iraq war based on lies that he knew were lies . . . His war has recruited more Al-Qaeda members than Osama bin Laden could ever have dreamed for . . . yet no one in the media is calling for impeachment. Unfortunately, the book and the play is more relevant now than it ever has been. It talks about continuous warfare as a means to control the Western economy, and as a way to control rebel elements within society through the use of fear, constant fear. In my country we seem to be sanctioning renditioning of innocent people without trial . . . put them in jail without telling anyone . . . and torture them out of suspicion of what we think they might do. This is exactly what [George Orwell] was talking about when he spoke of thought crimes.      I\'m six foot four and a half and I have a temper.      Hollywood is full of closet Republicans, and also you\'re sometimes not sure who your friends are. When the whole Bull Durham (1988) controversy happened there were three people who came very vociferously to our support, all either very conservative Democrats or Republicans - Clint Eastwood, Kevin Costner and Jack Valenti. And how many liberals? I didn\'t see any. So I am not one that makes a judgment on someone because they are Republican. I know enough Republicans that are decent people, they love their families, we might have differences of opinion but we can find common ground.      Haven\'t criminal acts occurred in government? Shouldn\'t there be accountability for inept policy decisions? Shouldn\'t someone be fired? And you know something? I didn\'t hear any of that, because I am still thinking about that starlet getting out of the car without the panties.      For me, the artist always comes first. It\'s what you do, it informs every area of your life, every decision you make in your life, just as being a butcher or a librarian might do. I think we find our activism from specific experiences in our lives. With me it was growing up in Greenwich Village in the \'60s with a bunch of bohemian iconoclasts. So the activism is important, but you can\'t make great art unless it\'s motivated by the art.      Clint [Clint Eastwood] - he\'s a revelation, a gem. A gentleman. A man who\'s very loyal to people he works with. He makes you realize that you don\'t need a lot of noise and bells and whistles to make a movie. You need simplicity of focus and professionalism.      I am an obsessive vinyl collector, although I\'m not good at filing. But I am a Luddite when it comes to music. I have an iPod, but things sound so much better on vinyl and cassette. Cassettes are a very underrated medium. My old ones still sound terrific, way better than any MP3. Pity it\'s so hard to buy a tape deck these days!      All baddies are complex characters with redeeming qualities. When I played an Afrikaner police officer in Catch a Fire (2006), I had to throw my beliefs aside and look into the humanity of people who\'ve done terrible things. It\'s when you meet these people and break bread with them that you start to empathise. When you hear their stories, you can understand why they did what they did. That doesn\'t justify it but, in any situation, anyone is capable of rationalising bad behaviour. So much so that you start to believe that it\'s good behaviour.      When we started it we were all punk rockers, big Clash [The Clash] fans. We didn\'t want to do the theatre that was being done at our university theatre department. We had a different idea of what theatre could be. We wanted the energy we felt when we went to punk shows, that drive, that sweat . . . Why shouldn\'t actors commit like that, too?      [on Lou Reed] I love Lou. I\'ve met him a few times. Man, ""Street Hassle"". I can listen to that album any time.      I actually have a couple of inches on Morgan [Morgan Freeman], and I won\'t say where. Ha, ha! It\'s true, there aren\'t many actors as tall as me. So it\'s great when you do meet one who is. It\'s great to look someone in the eye, rather than getting a little neck ache. Do I find it difficult to play supporting roles, being so tall? I never think about it that way. Perhaps the tallest person should have the most lines in a script. Maybe that\'s how it should work. I like that idea.      I would love to see the Hank Williams story at some point. It\'s a great tale and the music is fantastic. I\'d also like to see the Bob Marley story, and I\'d love to see a film about Louis Prima and Keely Smith. But, biography-wise, I might be more inclined to make a film about someone who wasn\'t that well known. There\'s all kinds of interesting musicians who never had their stories told; there\'s a ton of obscure musicians from the \'60s, or the punk era, who would be ideal.      I don\'t want to be working for the sake of working. I don\'t want to spend my time doing something I don\'t love. But, at the same time, everything leads to something. Howard the Duck (1986) seemed like a great idea at the time. It was George Lucas, who\'d just done the Star Wars trilogy. It was a lot of money. I wound up getting paid twice for it! It fuelled my theatre company for a couple of years and provided me with great creative freedom. If they\'d cast the duck correctly, we might have had something there. Blame it on the duck!      [on Miss Firecracker (1989)] That was my first mononucleic performance. I was in such a bad mood and sleeping all the time. I couldn\'t understand what was happening because I\'m usually so energetic and committed to what I\'m doing. The last day of shooting I found out I had mononucleosis.      [on Mystic River (2003)] Eastwood [Clint Eastwood] shows you a model of how to do this as a living and not torture yourself. He doesn\'t waste time; he does one take, maybe two if you\'re lucky. There are no bells and whistles, hissy fits or anxiety attacks. You come to work no earlier than 9 a.m. and you leave, usually, after lunch. You\'ve created a really good movie and have a life. I thought ""Mystic River"" was really great. But we didn\'t have to torture ourselves for it.      [on turning 50] I\'m at a stage in my life where I have a certain confidence. Of course, there\'s always got to be a fear, a self-regulation. You never can believe you\'re hot. I think that\'s the death of you, when you start believing you\'re a great actor. I\'ve run into those people. Anyone\'s capable of a shitty performance on a given day. It\'s more important for me to be in work that\'ll be around 10 years from now. I have enough money; I\'m not greedy in that way. I think longevity is the key.      [on his father Gil Robbins] The most important thing I got from him about music is that it is something that is a legitimate way to make a living, and it\'s something that must have a discipline behind it. As a kid, many times I would come home from school and dad would be working on his compositions, writing an oratorio. I remember his musical notes were quite beautiful. So I considered it something not to be taken lightly. It\'s something you do because you have something to say and feel you have a story to tell.      Your job as an actor is to lay bare the emotions. You want to achieve an honesty and a truth in the way you portray a character. It\'s the same with music and with the dynamic of the performer and how you relate to an audience. Regardless of what kind of stage you\'re going onto, whether it\'s movies or theatre or music, you\'re taking people on a journey. But the thing about music is that it\'s your story: no one else has written the script.      There are scripts that you don\'t want to touch at all, that are so brilliant that you just have to figure a way into the character, and that\'s your job. There\'s other stuff that you have to fill out on your own and flesh out on your own. I try not to get involved with rewriting. I don\'t think it\'s necessary for an actor to do that. I think it\'s necessary for an actor to say, \'This doesn\'t ring true. Is there something else we can do here?\'      I think the world needs a good Viking movie [1989, before the release of the flop Erik the Viking (1989)]    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","[u'\nMorgan Freeman ', u'""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 137 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(2)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(2)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(5)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(70)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(56)\xa0|Salary\xa0(1)  Overview (2)Date of Birth1\xa0June1937,\xa0Memphis, Tennessee, USA Height6\'\xa02""\xa0(1.88\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          With an authoritative voice and calm demeanor, this ever popular American actor has grown into one of the most respected figures in modern US cinema. Morgan was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended Los Angeles City College before serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!.Throughout the 1970s, he continued his work on stage, winning Drama Desk and Clarence Derwent Awards and receiving a Tony Award nomination for his performance in The Mighty Gents in 1978. In 1980, he won two Obie Awards, for his portrayal of Shakespearean anti-hero Coriolanus at the New York Shakespeare Festival and for his work in Mother Courage and Her Children. Freeman won another Obie in 1984 for his performance as The Messenger in the acclaimed Brooklyn Academy of Music production of Lee Breuer\'s The Gospel at Colonus and, in 1985, won the Drama-Logue Award for the same role. In 1987, Freeman created the role of Hoke Coleburn in Alfred Uhry\'s Pulitzer Prize-winning play Driving Miss Daisy, which brought him his fourth Obie Award. In 1990, Freeman starred as Petruchio in the New York Shakespeare Festival\'s The Taming of the Shrew, opposite Tracey Ullman. Returning to the Broadway stage in 2008, Freeman starred with Frances McDormand and Peter Gallagher in Clifford Odets\' drama The Country Girl, directed by Mike Nichols.Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including ""Easy Reader"", ""Mel Mounds"" and ""Count Dracula"" on the Children\'s Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show The Electric Company (1971). He then moved into feature film with another children\'s adventure, Who Says I Can\'t Ride a Rainbow! (1971). Next, there was a small role in the thriller Blade (1973); then he played Casca in Julius Caesar (1979) and the title role in Coriolanus (1979). Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas Attica (1980) and Brubaker (1980), Eyewitness (1981), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in Death of a Prophet (1981). For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an Oscar nomination as a merciless hoodlum in Street Smart (1987) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second Oscar nomination in the film version of Driving Miss Daisy (1989) opposite Jessica Tandy. The same year, Freeman teamed up with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery Denzel Washington in the epic Civil War drama Glory (1989) about freed slaves being recruited to form the first all-African American fighting brigade.His star continued to rise, and the 1990s kicked off strongly with roles in The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990), Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991), and The Power of One (1992). Freeman\'s next role was as gunman Ned Logan, wooed out of retirement by friend William Munny to avenge several prostitutes in the wild west town of Big Whiskey in Clint Eastwood\'s de-mythologized western Unforgiven (1992). The film was a sh and scored an acting Oscar for Gene Hackman, a directing Oscar for Eastwood, and the Oscar for best picture. In 1993, Freeman made his directorial debut on Bopha! (1993) and soon after formed his production company, Revelations Entertainment.More strong scripts came in, and Freeman was back behind bars depicting a knowledgeable inmate (and obtaining his third Oscar nomination), befriending falsely accused banker Tim Robbins in The Shawshank Redemption (1994). He was then back out hunting a religious serial killer in Se7en (1995), starred alongside Keanu Reeves in Chain Reaction (1996), and was pursuing another serial murderer in Kiss the Girls (1997).Further praise followed for his role in the slave tale of Amistad (1997), he was a worried US President facing Armageddon from above in Deep Impact (1998), appeared in Neil LaBute\'s black comedy Nurse Betty (2000), and reprised his role as Alex Cross in Along Came a Spider (2001). Now highly popular, he was much in demand with cinema audiences, and he co-starred in the terrorist drama The Sum of All Fears (2002), was a military officer in the Stephen King-inspired Dreamcatcher (2003), gave divine guidance as God to Jim Carrey in Bruce Almighty (2003), and played a minor role in the comedy The Big Bounce (2004).2005 was a huge year for Freeman. First, he he teamed up with good friend Clint Eastwood to appear in the drama, Million Dollar Baby (2004). Freeman\'s on-screen performance is simply world-class as ex-prize fighter Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris, who works in a run-down boxing gym alongside grizzled trainer Frankie Dunn, as the two work together to hone the skills of never-say-die female boxer Hilary Swank. Freeman received his fourth Oscar nomination and, finally, impressed the Academy\'s judges enough to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. He also narrated Steven Spielberg\'s War of the Worlds (2005) and appeared in Batman Begins (2005) as Lucius Fox, a valuable ally of Christian Bale\'s Bruce Wayne/Batman for director Christopher Nolan. Freeman would reprise his role in the two sequels of the record-breaking, genre-redefining trilogy.Roles in tentpoles and indies followed; highlights include his role as a crime boss in Lucky Number Slevin (2006), a second go-round as God in Evan Almighty (2007) with Steve Carell taking over for Jim Carrey, and a supporting role in Ben Affleck\'s directorial debut, Gone Baby Gone (2007). He co-starred with Jack Nicholson in the breakout hit The Bucket List (2007) in 2007, and followed that up with another box-office success, Wanted (2008), then segued into the second Batman film, The Dark Knight (2008).In 2009, he reunited with Eastwood to star in the director\'s true-life drama Invictus (2009), on which Freeman also served as an executive producer. For his portrayal of Nelson Mandela in the film, Freeman garnered Oscar, Golden Globe and Critics\' Choice Award nominations, and won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor.Recently, Freeman appeared in RED (2010), a surprise box-office hit; he narrated the Conan the Barbarian (2011) remake, starred in Rob Reiner\'s The Magic of Belle Isle (2012); and capped the Batman trilogy with The Dark Knight Rises (2012). Freeman has several films upcoming, including the thriller Now You See Me (2013), under the direction of Louis Leterrier, and the science fiction actioner Oblivion (2013), in which he stars with Tom Cruise.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       firehouse44@hotmail.com          Spouse (2)               Myrna Colley-Lee          (16 June\xa01984            - 15 September\xa02010)\xa0(divorced)                         Jeanette Adair Bradshaw          (22 October\xa01967            - 18 November\xa01979)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(2 children)          Trade Mark (5)        Frequently plays characters with calm demeanor        [Narration] Often provides narration for his films, as either himself or the character he is playing.

[on his hesitation to do Along Came a Spider (2001)] I had a philosophic aversion to it. I didn\'t want to do the same thing twice. Then I realized that my philosophical aversion was bullshit. I realized I liked Alex Cross. And the fact that he\'s black is totally incidental. That\'s a rare thing for a black actor to find.      [on the failure of The Big Bounce (2004)] It was a wonderful experience. Steve Bing was the producer and was very generous. But the movie didn\'t turn out very well. The director [George Armitage] fell ill and we shut down production for a few weeks while he recuperated. And I think when he came back he just didn\'t pick up the ball and run with it the way he should have, and the movie suffered greatly for that..      I\'ve been living with myself all of my life, so I know all of me. So when I watch me, all I see is me. It\'s boring. - on why he dislikes watching his own films.      I\'m not intimidated by lead roles. I\'m better in them. I don\'t feel pressure - I feel released at times like that. That\'s what I\'m born to do.      I was in Africa when I got the call for Unforgiven (1992). Clint called my agency and made an offer for a western. I was like ""He called for me?"" It was jaw-dropping.      [on the box-office failure of The Shawshank Redemption (1994)] It took a long time for word of mouth to kick in because no one could say it. It was ""The Shimshunk Reduction"", ""The Hudsucker Redemption""; I mean people just couldn\'t say it, which really made me angry because I knew that at the time! The movie we made was called ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"". Isn\'t that a great title? But they were like ""That won\'t fit on the marquee"". So it took a year or two for people to say it. Some people still can\'t say it.      [on the violence in Se7en (1995)] If you don\'t show the actual violence and the audience provides their own violence, it\'s much more gruesome. This is a guy who spent a lot time planning and preparing, and what was he doing? He was punishing people for their sins. He had a moral agenda. A twisted moral agenda, but do you know how many people do? People in high places.      [on the box-office failure of Amistad (1997)] People thought it was a picture about slavery. But it wasn\'t about slavery at all. It was about American jurisprudence. The point of the film ultimately was that the President in not the king. But I think people were like ""Jesus, not another movie about slavery!"" We really do have a negative response to negative history. Which is a shame.      [on the failure of The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)] I knew that movie wasn\'t going to work. I don\'t think Brian De Palma had a clue. It struck me that he didn\'t read the book - or that he didn\'t like the book. It was the one time Tom Hanks was awfully miscast. Originally, they hired Alan Arkin to play my role. I thought that was perfect casting. But then they thought they had to be politically correct and make the judge black. So they fired Alan Arkin and hired me. Not a great way to get a role. I was kind of a suck-a-- for not turning it down, but they weren\'t going to give it back to Alan anyway. I never did get around to seeing the movie.      [on the character Hoke Colburn in Driving Miss Daisy (1989)] It\'s a tricky character, right on the edge of Uncle Remus. But I knew how to play him right away. I knew when I read it. I just saw him -- the dignity in the character. The only time I ever worried about it was when I was doing the show Off-Broadway, and all these Southerners would come back wiping their eyes and talking about how nostalgic it made them feel. How their grandmother had a chauffeur just like that. I was like ""God damn it! I made these people nostalgic for the good ol\' days!"" But, then, I had some black friends see it, and they said, \'Oh, my grandfather was exactly like that.\' So that made me feel okay..      [on working on The Shawshank Redemption (1994)] That was a strange production. There were moments of extreme tension on the set. Between the producers and actors, between the director and actors, between everybody. Just this personality stuff between different groups. Very strange. Let\'s stop talking about that one.      [on Se7en (1995)] There\'s all this loss and angst and death and sense of helplessness in that movie - if I saw it in the theater, I probably wouldn\'t have liked it. I saw Fight Club (1999) and I didn\'t like it much. It\'s a great movie, well made, fabulous acting, but it just made me feel so bad. But David Fincher is an extraordinarily good director.      When I was doing press for Deep Impact (1998), reporters would always ask me how it felt to play the first black president, and I\'d tell them, ""I\'m not playing the first black president. I\'m playing a president who happens to be black."" Or they\'d ask me what sort of research I did for the role. Research? What kind of research do you need to play the president? He\'s a guy. Besides, we all know what presidents are like standing up there in a press conference. Hell, you don\'t have to do any research to play a president.      I saw Neil LaBute\'s first movie, In the Company of Men (1997), and I thought it sucked deeply. I mean, talk about a couple of scuzzy guys. Man, they were turds. But I was intrigued by the mind that would think this up and film it. Then I saw LaBute\'s second movie, Your Friends & Neighbors (1998). Not any better, but still intriguing. So then I got the script for Nurse Betty (2000), and I loved it and I went and met him. And it turns out he\'s married, has these lovely kids. He\'s just this big bear of a man. Cuddly, even. It didn\'t take any persuading to convince me to do the film.      When I got nominated for the Oscar [for Street Smart (1987)], it put rocket boosters in my career. Since childhood, all I wanted to do was make movies. I love the stage, but I wanted to be a movie actor.      Is there a movie I think I should have won the Oscar for? Yeah. All of them.      I don\'t know what my favorite film of mine is... But I think the most important film I was in was Glory (1989).      It was my idea to just do The Electric Company (1971) for a couple of years and go on. But you get trapped by that money thing. It\'s golden handcuffs. It gets a lot of people, including soap opera actors and commercial actors. Then, they don\'t want to see you in serious work. That was going to be me, having people come up to me saying ""My kids love you!"" I was there three years too long.      I find it difficult to watch myself... I find it boring.      I was talking to Bob Hoskins when we were making Unleashed together. We were talking about the joy of doing bad guys. And he confirmed exactly what I was thinking. With bad guys you get to let it all out. All those dark places in your psyche? You can let \'em go. When you play good guys, it\'s kind of boring. It\'s one note.      Once you\'ve gotten the job, there\'s nothing to it. If you\'re an actor, you\'re an actor. Doing it is not the hard part. The hard part is getting to do it.      [Accepting his UCLA Tracy award]: To be included among this group of highly accomplished actors is just magical.      I\'m very worried about what\'s going on in the world at the moment because we have this Napoleonic president; by Napoleonic I mean he\'s a man who just seems to need to search himself. It doesn\'t make sense. I don\'t have any love lost on Saddam Hussein. If he needs to be removed from office, fine. You have to find the right way to do it, but going to war, nah, with the people. To do what. What is the real reason? Because he\'s harboring weapons of mass destruction? So it is with North Korea. Why are we acting to acquiesce to this? We do not need the Iraqi oil. We have Kuwait oil. It\'s the same pool. That\'s why Kuwait\'s there. That\'s why Kuwait was set up. You think that country could exist there without somebody backing it? We\'re talking about a piece of Iraq. So, we keep this. That\'s my noise. I am terribly upset about the whole thing.      You know, I was hanging out with Sidney Poitier and we were trying to decide if he or I were the better actor. We decided it was me as I convinced the world I could sing. (Freeman debuted on Broadway in 1968 in ""Hello, Dolly!"")      Stop talking about it. I\'m going to stop calling you a white man. And I\'m going to ask you to stop calling me a black man. - when asked how to get rid of racism in an interview with Mike Wallace on 60 Minutes (1968).      Ridiculous... I don\'t want a Black History Month. Black history is American history. - when asked what he thinks of Black History Month on 60 Minutes (1968).      The American Indians have this saying. \'Look at the day, look at the sunlight, the grass and the trees! It\'s a good day to die!\'      You couldn\'t possibly try to entertain all of the people who seem to be offering you entertainment. Because most of them want some compensation for it.      [upon waking up face down in a door way and not knowing how he got there] I recognised that it had become a problem, so I just quit. I do have self-control. Once I realise that I\'ve got to change something I just do it.      If you wake up and the snow is knee-deep outside, you are not filled with rage. It\'s just something that you\'ve got to cope with. If you\'re living in a situation it\'s the only situation that you know, and you\'ve got to deal with it.      I don\'t have to work. I could stop and never have to worry about paying the rent. I\'m working for the joy of doing it.      Sometimes, you want to upset an audience so you can engage them. I\'ve done so-called Hollywood films, and I know that it\'s all about wanting the audience to feel upbeat, give them a happy ending. But they also like complete stories. If your story\'s complete it doesn\'t have to have a happy ending.      They say there\'s no fool like an old fool. But blessings be upon my wife because I think without her, I\'d be somebody\'s fool by now.      If you live a life of make-believe, your life isn\'t worth anything until you do something that does challenge your reality. And to me, sailing the open ocean is a real challenge, because it\'s life or death.      [upon getting work as an off-Broadway actor in 1967] I made $70 a week as an actor and I\'d been making $60 in L.A. Making more than that as an actor was just unbelievable to me. I never went back to typing but had some real lean times in-between. But I didn\'t have to go to work for anybody else. I didn\'t have to wash dishes, I didn\'t have to wait tables, I didn\'t have to drive a cab or wash cars. I deliberately left myself nothing to fall back on. If you\'ve got a cushion, where you land, you stay. You can\'t climb a mountain with a net. If you\'ve got the net, you\'ll let go.      I work about half the year. I\'m just a guy who enjoys his work and enjoys working with people who enjoy their work. When that happens you get a bonding situation and if it come out with a good product, then that ties you even closer together. It\'s almost like a great love affair.      I\'ve never been a mechanic. Throughout my life, what I have been is an actor, a pretender. I do have the wife and the family and the stuff like that but on the other hand, I\'m - knock on wood - outstandingly healthy.      I think we all have a private bucket list. It may not be written down, but I\'m constantly checking them off. I just checked off Jack Nicholson. Every day was a holiday because I\'ve been praying at the temple of Jack ever since Five Easy Pieces (1970). I had a chance to ride with him on the Warner Brothers plane with Clint [Eastwood]. I got to jawing what a fan I was, and as actors will do, he expressed how he liked my work. Then we started talking about how we could make a sequel to [the 1973 Nicholson film] The Last Detail (1973). But that didn\'t pan out.      My aim in life, when I graduated from high school, was to get out of Mississippi. I started coming back [to Mississippi] in about 1979, because my parents moved back, which I couldn\'t understand. What in the world would make you come back here? It took me about 20 years to figure that out.      I\'m not a campaigner or a crusader for ending racism, or anything for that matter. I believe you should live your life according to your own tenets. If there are people you don\'t like, avoid them. But not liking people based on generalities is stupid.      No, but a lot of roles I refuse because it\'s not me. -- on if he ever feels he\'s been miscast.      Isn\'t there a big, 800-pound gorilla missing here? Money, money, money. You work all your life so you don\'t have to wash dishes or sweep floors or pump gas, and still pay the rent. That\'s very germane to what you call a career.      I don\'t know about anyone else, but my kids didn\'t have me. I was busy trying to be somebody. Now I have all these debts to pay. -- on the personal toll being an actor can take on a person.      I don\'t think that anything where you start off with something is an art form. If you start off with a blank page or a blank canvas or a blank slab or a blank stone, you\'re going to create something. If someone brings it to you and says, ""Can you enlarge upon it?"".      I\'m not good at anything else. Certainly not golf. -- on why he is an actor.      The fact that the people who are making the decisions about moviemaking are not moviemakers is a big problem.      I don\'t do accents. But I was going to have to do some sort of accent and do my best to sound like Mandela. I really fretted over that because he\'s an iconic figure. If you screw it up you\'ve screwed it up. But once we got into production, it all fell into place. -- on the toughest aspect of preparing for ""Invictus""      I don\'t like tension on a set -- at all, of any kind.Glory (1989) does what I think movies are best at, and that is giving you a lesson in history. Glory is a story that nobody knew. It\'s American history that was completely ignored, and there is an awful lot of that. It is because the people who tell the story tell their own story. So if you ever ask, any time down the line, that\'s always the film I\'ll be most proud of.      [on The Shawshank Redemption (1994)] That is the film that most people will mention. It\'s not the only one, but it\'s the most common. I think more people have seen Shawshank than have seen anything else bar Casablanca (1942). Me, I just take the compliment.      I never think about awards or anything like that when I do a job. I was first named a best actor when I was 12 years old and it doesn\'t really mean anything when you get down to it, because there is no best. I don\'t get all that involved. My chest puffs up as much as I can puff it up but I am not trying to be better than the person I am acting with. I am trying to be at least as good. That\'s how it works.      [on Michael Wincott] Michael is a sweetheart, he has an enormous power. He is one of those people who\'s totally dedicated to what he\'s doing. I certainly get enjoyment out of working with him. He\'s great to rehearse with, he\'s always got ideas and this incredible sense of humor and this kind of outlandish take on things.      I never wanted to be a movie star. I never wanted to be a personality. Then all you do is turn yourself into what the audience wants and play it over and over. That\'s what movie stars do.      [on the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963] On that dreadful afternoon I, along with most of the other people in New York, found myself on the street, wandering in a daze, shocked to realize the enormity of the act. I think that\'s when America began to lose her way.      Stillness. It\'s what I learn from the actors I work with. That\'s all, and that\'s the hardest thing.Salary (1)Kiss the Girls\xa0(1997)      $5,000,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","[u'\nBob Gunton ', u'""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 28 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(2)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(2)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(14)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(6)  Overview (3)Date of Birth15\xa0November1945,\xa0Santa Monica, California, USA Birth NameRobert Patrick Gunton Jr.Height6\'\xa02""\xa0(1.88\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Bob Gunton was born on November 15, 1945 in Santa Monica, California, USA as Robert Patrick Gunton Jr. He is an actor, known for The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Argo (2012) and 24 (2008).

My first presidential primary vote was for Bobby Kennedy.      I was a grunt, walking around in the jungle of Vietnam, trying not to find the enemy. Because I am so big, they were going to give me either a heavy radio or a huge machine gun to carry. I carried a radio.      In film roles, I play a lot of heavies and a lot of bad guys, so I tend to be the jokester and the good-time Charlie on the set.      I was the adoring son of a Welsh-Irish father, a dyed-in-the-wool Democrat, a Catholic Knight of Columbus who was a blue-collar, trade union organizer and, not surprisingly, a fervid Nixon-hater.      Among the roles I\'ve played on stage, television and in films were politicos as diverse as Abe Lincoln, Juan Peron, Herman Goering, George Wallace and both Roosevelts.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","[u'\nWilliam Sadler ', u'""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 24 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(4)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(13)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(1)  Overview (4)Date of Birth13\xa0April1950,\xa0Buffalo, New York, USA Birth NameWilliam Thomas SadlerNicknameBill    Height5\'\xa07""\xa0(1.7\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          William Thomas Sadler was born on April 13, 1950 in Buffalo, New York, to Jane and William Sadler.

He was sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947. Dufresne was the frequent target of sexual abuse from a prison clique known as the Sisters. His sage financial advice earned him protection from prison guards. Dufresne used his considerable intelligence and education to improve the prison library, which he named after former inmate and librarian Brooks Hatlen, and helped a number of convicts earn their high school diplomas. He also used his banking knowledge to start a money laundering scheme on behalf of prison warden Samuel Norton. In 1966 Dufresne attempted to win a new trial when fellow inmate Tommy Williams told the story of a former cellmate at another prison confessing to the murder of Dufresne\'s wife and lover. Warden Norton squashed Dufresne\'s hopes out of fear that Andy would inform authorities of the money laundering despite Andy\'s promise to remain silent. After spending two months in an area of the prison known as ""the hole"", during which time Williams was assassinated, Dufresne escaped from Shawshank. He took documental evidence of the laundering scheme with him, which he would later mail to a Portland newspaper. Using the alias Randall Stevens (the name under the illegal accounts) Dufresne visited a number of Portland-area banks, withdrawing approximately p$370,000, money Norton intended to retire with. Dufresne buried some money in a hayfield near Buxton, Maine, at a location only known to his prison friend Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, then fled to Zihuatanejo, Mexico, where he operated a hotel with charter fishing services for guests.

Redding was denied parole in 1947 and 1957 despite pleas to the parole board that he had been rehabilitated. Redding was granted parole in 1967 even though he displayed callous indifference to the parole board; afterwards he lived in a halfway house and worked as a bagger at a grocery store. In keeping a promise to his friend, escaped inmate Andy Dufresne, Redding traveled to a hayfield near Buxton, Maine to unearth an item buried near an oak tree and rock wall. The item was a box containing money and an invitation to join Dufresne at his location undisclosed in the letter; Redding knew the site as Zihuatanejo, Mexico from an earlier conversation he had with Dufresne in the prison yard.

To create something of this nature, a director must approach\nit\nin a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a\ndaunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable\nmanagerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of\nart in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting.\nThese elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet\nstill form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of\nthe artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for\nhis\nnotable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his\nfeature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself\nalready a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most\nrecognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The\nShawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the\nemotions,\nand brings an era of artistically influential films back to\nHollywood.<br><br>The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense,\nvictimized\nby circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his\nwife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a\nlife sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in\nthis prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls\naround him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from\nhis fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly\nreferred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within\nthe drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare\nto\nthe confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope\ncauses\nRed to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy\nproves\nto Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank\nprison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.<br><br>By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled\nscreenplay\npaved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with\nthe phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella,\nRita\nHayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that\nhe can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous\npiece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many\nways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas\nwhere the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film\ntransitions ever.<br><br>While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella,\nDarabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of\nemotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the\ncunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred\nNewman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing\nNewman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as\nif a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism\nand tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score\ncomposition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score\nreceived an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent,\nNewman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from\nthe film.<br><br>With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers,\ncomposers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast\nof The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The\nmarvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most\nconvincing\nperformances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan\nFreeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting\nlies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear\ninto their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James\nWhitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man\nincarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself\nattached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these\nactors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their\nmotivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to\nanything unbelievable.<br><br>With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the\nmost beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as\nits focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope\nand\nfreedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly\nyearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws\nits\naudience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart\nwill go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions,\nand deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a\ngreat\nnovel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply\nentertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully,\nillustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us\na\npoignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we\nall seek.<br><br>This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it\nlong lost in a dark sea of clich\xe9s and predictability.  Darabont shows us\nthat artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities.\nThese artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires\nyou to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The\nShawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone\nwho\nrealizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still\nlive on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we\nwill never forget.\n\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nI have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption.\nShawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams.

Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and\nPulp Fiction were ""just happy to be nominated."" Of course hindsight is\n20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and\nRedemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however,\nwas a success from the word ""go,"" making a huge splash at Cannes and\nmaking its writer-director an American master after only two films. For\nAndy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure\nwasn't a life sentence.<br><br>After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell\nfast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for\nfailure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans\ntoday, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was.\nOn the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on\n""that 'Rickshaw' movie."" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as\n'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between\ntwo best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie\nis slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post,\n""it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance\nof narrative exit points before settling on its finale."" But it is\nthese same weaknesses that make the film so strong.<br><br>Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a\ntotal eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and\nGothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts\nits shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above\nevery shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all\nmemories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope.\nIt's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; ""In here's\nwhere you need it most,"" he says. ""You need it so you don't forget.\nForget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of\nstone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's\nyours, that they can't touch."" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much\nof Andy at first, picking ""that tall glass o' milk with the silver\nspoon up his ass"" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word,\nand losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two\nget to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This\nagain, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about\nlove, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the\nonly one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two\nbest friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship\ntime and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's\nday to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional,\nbut Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film\nis much better for it.<br><br>It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the\nsame actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well\nover 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in\nreality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the\nfilm lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going,\nit merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off\nas well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more\nexhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be\nforgotten.<br><br>With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to\nbe found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ\nfigure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard\nNixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they\ncome. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to\nanyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving\nfilm, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much\nbetter than this.<br><br>OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message\nof hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved\nthere is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran\nsolely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of\n1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally\nswapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time --\nredemption indeed.

Every moment of\nthis movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing\nin life...... ""HOPE"".  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold,\nfunny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same\ntime.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the\ngreatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie\nhistory!  How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting.\nI should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well,\nand the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan.\nThe only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will\nnever see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many\nmovies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I\nwalk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it\nwith and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as\n'you know what'!""  There have been many movies over the past few years that\nthought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of\nall time"", but they've all fallen far short of ""The Shawshank\nRedemption"".\nSo, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store\nimmediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the ""employee picks"" section.\nAnd if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there\nthat there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this\nmovie, go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one.\nIn fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an\nemergency. :o)\nSo, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!<br><br>\n</br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nI'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you\nshould consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five\nbucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up\ngoing back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies\nthat are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter\nhow many times you view it.<br><br>Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll\ndiscover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll\nidentify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a\ncharacter, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope,\nyou'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of\novercoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in\nways that you can't find in movies today. <br><br>Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course,\nsome can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in\nhumanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or\ntimes. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships\nthat prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it\nto you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether\nShawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home,\nbecause it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward.\nNominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single\nOscar. <br><br>How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the\ncorruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the\ncharacter of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics\ncouldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially\ndismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a\nWonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away\non the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell.\nBut the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed\ntrue. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of\nall time. <br><br>Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the\nfilm's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a\nprison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people.\nShawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single\nspecial effect or digitally- enhanced frame. <br><br>But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to\nthe bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The\nstory, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the\ntown of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played\ntheir roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nThe Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It\nis an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and\nShawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film\nportrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is\nsentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for\napparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going\nbut finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate, Ellis\n""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden\nfinds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker.\nHowever, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things\nfor all of them.<br><br>There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film\nback in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about\nwhat it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it,\nShawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come\nAcademy Award time the film received several nominations, and although\nit won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home\nentertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film\nfinally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost\nmythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that\nhas delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors.\nOne thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank\nfence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will\nnever go away.<br><br>It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the\nfilm into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent\nsentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two\nchief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. But\nwhen characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it\nstrikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope,\nfriendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that\nacts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of\nthe soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No\nchance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during\nincarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of\nRobbins (never better) &amp; Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the\neasiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.<br><br>Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled\nspring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great\nas the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist\nCapt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood &amp; Mark Rolston is\nimpressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush\ncinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison\noffering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours).\nThe music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie\ntoo. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly\nwith Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack\nranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di\nFigaro by Mozart.<br><br>If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every\nviewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement -\nhappiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most\nhardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank\noffers hope - not just for characters in a movie, but for a better life\nand a better world for all of us. 10/10\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nAt the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible\nperformance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get\nthings, the ""only"" guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by\nthe Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for\nForrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly\nunderplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the\nlifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the\nwarmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan\nFreeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated\nrecognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle\nfor some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.<br><br>But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story,\nbanker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his\nwife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he\nlends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It\nis as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this\nis the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with\nhis work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic\nRiver (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.<br><br>It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the\nBible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden\nSamuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want\nto tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians\nactually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is\nrevealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent,\npredatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated\nR). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten\ncontents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words ""His\njudgment cometh and that right soon."" The irony of these words as they\napply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is\njust perfect. You will take delight, I promise.<br><br>Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you.\nAs most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King\nentitled ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption."" Rita Hayworth\nfigures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that\nhe pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film\nGilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black\nand white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita\nHayworth appears. If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie.\nShe really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next\nappears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It's\nthe famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her\nshapely legs. Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these\npinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million\nYears B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show\nus graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.<br><br>Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and\nnaturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out\nafter fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with\nlife on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red's\nperiodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is\nsummarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.<br><br>The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb:\nthere's not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference\nbetween the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the\nwarden, the guards, the ""sisters,"" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn,\nand perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might\nbe realistic, and perhaps the ""redemption"" is a bit too miraculous in\nhow beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.<br><br>All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with\na true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and\nthat is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship\nand the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and\nunfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.<br><br>Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The\nGodfather) at the IMDb. Don't miss it.<br><br>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut\nto the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

I've read a lot of the previous comments; all those that\ngush and eulogise as well as those who think it's over-rated or cliched.\nMost have got good points to make, however the thing that I think everyone\nis struggling to both explain and come to terms with is just why this film\nis *so* loved.  Loved to the extent that for many it is an almost spiritual\nexperience or for those of a more secular nature like myself, loved as one\nof the most devastatingly uplifting things that can happen to you while\nwatching a film.<br><br>So I'm not going to review it, I'm just going to struggle in my own way to\nexplain this film.  It took me a few viewings to get why I connect with it\nso deeply, but here goes.<br><br>Many people in this world are unhappy.  Most people in this world don't\nwant\nto be unhappy.  Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic\nwand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once\nand\nfor all.  They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state,\nwhile they suffer.  To borrow the words of another film, they're watching\nthe bluebirds flying over the rainbow.<br><br>Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist.\nThey're\nnot destined to join the bluebirds and fairytales don't come true.  It's\nnot\nthat no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to.\nThey're busy dying.<br><br>In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale,\nmagic wands exist.  And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini.\nHowever this film is not about him.  Neither is it about the prison, the\ngovernor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script,\nthe direction or the score.<br><br>It's about Red.  He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's\nnot only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever\nleaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would\never happen to him, he couldn't cope.  He's safe in his unhappiness and\nthat\nsecurity is what keeps him going.  Hope is, as Red say, dangerous.  The\nmetaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a\nrather large number of people suffer from it.  A large proportion of those\ndon't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow\nsufferer.  Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely\ndon't understand what's going on in those who do.  They're too busy\nliving.<br><br>The miracle in this film is not only that Red is redeemed but that the\nworld\noutside the prison isn't all warm and sandy and sunny and with excellent\nfishing.  Some of it is rocky and uncertain.  Fairytales don't get this\nfar.\nThey'd end as Red left the gates of the prison and the credits would say\n'and he lived happily ever after'.  This is the only film I can currently\nthink of where they show how to get to the living happily ever after bit\nfrom your redemption via the rocky and uncertain ground of bagging\ngroceries\nat the local store.  In other words, they're not going to cheat you and\ntell\nyou everything's going to be alright.<br><br>This is crucial.  For two and half hours, those of us who are quite content\nto mooch around our own personal prisons can see an escape route quite\ndifferent to Andy's mapped out on the screen.  And it's a real way out.\nIt's hard and upsetting, but ultimately rewarding.  The high you get from\nfinding out and knowing that is only comparable diamorphine.<br><br>The trouble is, if you're already busy living, this film won't mean that\nmuch and you'll see it a little more clearly than those busy dying.  To\nthose fortunate individuals, watch this film and understand what the rest\nof\nus are going through.<br><br>So, yes, this film is a cliched fairytale and maybe as a story it isn't\nrealistic and at second on the IMDb all time list, it is a bit over-rated.\nHowever if you could have a chart of films listing the number of lives\nsaved, altered and improved, the Shawshank Redemption would be way out in\nfront at number one.<br><br>\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nWe have all see movies, comedies, action and dramas.

Field of Dreams was\nthe first movie which invoked these emotions in me.  Shawshank Redemption\nis even more powerful for its simplicity.

However the title says it all.\nRedemption is what this story is all about.  And it is not necessarily\nredemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is\nredemption for the way you have lived your life.

Unlike Olivier, who preferred the stage to the screen, Brando concentrated his talents on movies after bidding the Broadway stage adieu in 1949, a decision for which he was severely criticized when his star began to dim in the 1960s and he was excoriated for squandering his talents. No actor ever exerted such a profound influence on succeeding generations of actors as did Brando. More than 50 years after he first scorched the screen as Stanley Kowalski in the movie version of Tennessee Williams\' A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and a quarter-century after his last great performance as Col. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola\'s Apocalypse Now (1979), all American actors are still being measured by the yardstick that was Brando. It was if the shadow of John Barrymore, the great American actor closest to Brando in terms of talent and stardom, dominated the acting field up until the 1970s. He did not, nor did any other actor so dominate the public\'s consciousness of what WAS an actor before or since Brando\'s 1951 on-screen portrayal of Stanley made him a cultural icon. Brando eclipsed the reputation of other great actors circa 1950, such as Paul Muni and Fredric March. Only the luster of Spencer Tracy\'s reputation hasn\'t dimmed when seen in the starlight thrown off by Brando. However, neither Tracy nor Olivier created an entire school of acting just by the force of his personality. Brando did.Marlon Brando, Jr. was born on April 3, 1924, in Omaha, Nebraska, to Marlon Brando, Sr., a calcium carbonate salesman, and his artistically inclined wife, the former Dorothy Julia Pennebaker. ""Bud"" Brando was one of three children. His ancestry included English, Irish, German, Dutch, French Huguenot, Welsh, and Scottish; his surname originated with a distant German immigrant ancestor named ""Brandau"". His oldest sister Jocelyn Brando was also an actress, taking after their mother, who engaged in amateur theatricals and mentored a then-unknown Henry Fonda, another Nebraska native, in her role as director of the Omaha Community Playhouse. Frannie, Brando\'s other sibling, was a visual artist. Both Brando sisters contrived to leave the Midwest for New York City, Jocelyn to study acting and Frannie to study art. Marlon managed to escape the vocational doldrums forecast for him by his cold, distant father and his disapproving schoolteachers by striking out for The Big Apple in 1943, following Jocelyn into the acting profession. Acting was the only thing he was good at, for which he received praise, so he was determined to make it his career - a high-school dropout, he had nothing else to fall back on, having been rejected by the military due to a knee injury he incurred playing football at Shattuck Military Academy, Brando Sr.\'s alma mater. The school booted Marlon out as incorrigible before graduation.Acting was a skill he honed as a child, the lonely son of alcoholic parents. With his father away on the road, and his mother frequently intoxicated to the point of stupefaction, the young Bud would play-act for her to draw her out of her stupor and to attract her attention and love. His mother was exceedingly neglectful, but he loved her, particularly for instilling in him a love of nature, a feeling which informed his character Paul in Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972) (""Last Tango in Paris"") when he is recalling his childhood for his young lover Jeanne. ""I don\'t have many good memories,"" Paul confesses, and neither did Brando of his childhood. Sometimes he had to go down to the town jail to pick up his mother after she had spent the night in the drunk tank and bring her home, events that traumatized the young boy but may have been the grain that irritated the oyster of his talent, producing the pearls of his performances. Anthony Quinn, his Oscar-winning co-star in Viva Zapata! (1952) told Brando\'s first wife Anna Kashfi, ""I admire Marlon\'s talent, but I don\'t envy the pain that created it.""Brando enrolled in Erwin Piscator\'s Dramatic Workshop at New York\'s New School, and was mentored by Stella Adler, a member of a famous Yiddish Theatre acting family. Adler helped introduce to the New York stage the ""emotional memory"" technique of Russian theatrical actor, director and impresario Konstantin Stanislavski, whose motto was ""Think of your own experiences and use them truthfully."" The results of this meeting between an actor and the teacher preparing him for a life in the theater would mark a watershed in American acting and culture.Brando made his debut on the boards of Broadway on October 19, 1944, in ""I Remember Mama,"" a great success. As a young Broadway actor, Brando was invited by talent scouts from several different studios to screen-test for them, but he turned them down because he would not let himself be bound by the then-standard seven-year contract. Brando would make his film debut quite some time later in Fred Zinnemann\'s The Men (1950) for producer Stanley Kramer. Playing a paraplegic soldier, Brando brought new levels of realism to the screen, expanding on the verisimilitude brought to movies by Group Theatre alumni John Garfield, the predecessor closest to him in the raw power he projected on-screen. Ironically, it was Garfield whom producer Irene Mayer Selznick had chosen to play the lead in a new Tennessee Williams play she was about to produce, but negotiations broke down when Garfield demanded an ownership stake in ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" Burt Lancaster was next approached, but couldn\'t get out of a prior film commitment. Then director Elia Kazan suggested Brando, whom he had directed to great effect in Maxwell Anderson\'s play ""Truckline Caf\xe9,"" in which Brando co-starred with Karl Malden, who was to remain a close friend for the next 60 years.During the production of ""Truckline Caf\xe9"", Kazan had found that Brando\'s presence was so magnetic, he had to re-block the play to keep Marlon near other major characters\' stage business, as the audience could not take its eyes off of him. For the scene where Brando\'s character re-enters the stage after killing his wife, Kazan placed him upstage-center, partially obscured by scenery, but where the audience could still see him as Karl Malden and others played out their scene within the caf\xe9 set. When he eventually entered the scene, crying, the effect was electric. A young Pauline Kael, arriving late to the play, had to avert her eyes when Brando made this entrance as she believed the young actor on stage was having a real-life conniption. She did not look back until her escort commented that the young man was a great actor.The problem with casting Brando as Stanley was that he was much younger than the character as written by Williams. However, after a meeting between Brando and Williams, the playwright eagerly agreed that Brando would make an ideal Stanley. Williams believed that by casting a younger actor, the Neanderthalish Kowalski would evolve from being a vicious older man to someone whose unintentional cruelty can be attributed to his youthful ignorance. Brando ultimately was dissatisfied with his performance, though, saying he never was able to bring out the humor of the character, which was ironic as his characterization often drew laughs from the audience at the expense of Jessica Tandy\'s Blanche Dubois. During the out-of-town tryouts, Kazan realized that Brando\'s magnetism was attracting attention and audience sympathy away from Blanche to Stanley, which was not what the playwright intended. The audience\'s sympathy should be solely with Blanche, but many spectators were identifying with Stanley. Kazan queried Williams on the matter, broaching the idea of a slight rewrite to tip the scales back to more of a balance between Stanley and Blanche, but Williams demurred, smitten as he was by Brando, just like the preview audiences.For his part, Brando believed that the audience sided with his Stanley because Jessica Tandy was too shrill. He thought Vivien Leigh, who played the part in the movie, was ideal, as she was not only a great beauty but she WAS Blanche Dubois, troubled as she was in her real life by mental illness and nymphomania. Brando\'s appearance as Stanley on stage and on screen revolutionized American acting by introducing ""The Method"" into American consciousness and culture. Method acting, rooted in Adler\'s study at the Moscow Art Theatre of Stanislavsky\'s theories that she subsequently introduced to the Group Theatre, was a more naturalistic style of performing, as it engendered a close identification of the actor with the character\'s emotions. Adler took first place among Brando\'s acting teachers, and socially she helped turn him from an unsophisticated Midwestern farm boy into a knowledgeable and cosmopolitan artist who one day would socialize with presidents.Brando didn\'t like the term ""The Method,"" which quickly became the prominent paradigm taught by such acting gurus as Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Brando denounced Strasberg in his autobiography ""Songs My Mother Taught Me"" (1994), saying that he was a talentless exploiter who claimed he had been Brando\'s mentor. The Actors Studio had been founded by Strasberg along with Kazan and Stella Adler\'s husband, Harold Clurman, all Group Theatre alumni, all political progressives deeply committed to the didactic function of the stage. Brando credits his knowledge of the craft to Adler and Kazan, while Kazan in his autobiography ""A Life"" claimed that Brando\'s genius thrived due to the thorough training Adler had given him. Adler\'s method emphasized that authenticity in acting is achieved by drawing on inner reality to expose deep emotional experienceInterestingly, Elia Kazan believed that Brando had ruined two generations of actors, his contemporaries and those who came after him, all wanting to emulate the great Brando by employing The Method. Kazan felt that Brando was never a Method actor, that he had been highly trained by Adler and did not rely on gut instincts for his performances, as was commonly believed. Many a young actor, mistaken about the true roots of Brando\'s genius, thought that all it took was to find a character\'s motivation, empathize with the character through sense and memory association, and regurgitate it all on stage to become the character. That\'s not how the superbly trained Brando did it; he could, for example, play accents, whereas your average American Method actor could not. There was a method to Brando\'s art, Kazan felt, but it was not The Method.After A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), for which he received the first of his eight Academy Award nominations, Brando appeared in a string of Academy Award-nominated performances - in Viva Zapata! (1952), Julius Caesar (1953) and the summit of his early career, Kazan\'s On the Waterfront (1954). For his ""Waterfront"" portrayal of meat-headed longshoreman Terry Malloy, the washed-up pug who ""coulda been a contender,"" Brando won his first Oscar. Along with his iconic performance as the rebel-without-a-cause Johnny in The Wild One (1953) (""What are you rebelling against?"" Johnny is asked. ""What have ya got?"" is his reply), the first wave of his career was, according to Jon Voight, unprecedented in its audacious presentation of such a wide range of great acting. Director John Huston said his performance of Marc Antony was like seeing the door of a furnace opened in a dark room, and co-star John Gielgud, the premier Shakespearean actor of the 20th century, invited Brando to join his repertory company.It was this period of 1951-54 that revolutionized American acting, spawning such imitators as James Dean - who modeled his acting and even his lifestyle on his hero Brando - the young Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. After Brando, every up-and-coming star with true acting talent and a brooding, alienated quality would be hailed as the ""New Brando,"" such as Warren Beatty in Kazan\'s Splendor in the Grass (1961). ""We are all Brando\'s children,"" Jack Nicholson pointed out in 1972. ""He gave us our freedom."" He was truly ""The Godfather"" of American acting - and he was just 30 years old. Though he had a couple of failures, like D\xe9sir\xe9e (1954) and The Teahouse of the August Moon (1956), he was clearly miscast in them and hadn\'t sought out the parts so largely escaped blame.In the second period of his career, 1955-62, Brando managed to uniquely establish himself as a great actor who also was a Top 10 movie star, although that star began to dim after the box-office high point of his early career, Sayonara (1957) (for which he received his fifth Best Actor Oscar nomination). Brando tried his hand at directing a film, the well-reviewed One-Eyed Jacks (1961) that he made for his own production company, Pennebaker Productions (after his mother\'s maiden name). Stanley Kubrick had been hired to direct the film, but after months of script rewrites in which Brando participated, Kubrick and Brando had a falling out and Kubrick was sacked. According to his widow Christiane Kubrick, Stanley believed that Brando had wanted to direct the film himself all along.Tales proliferated about the profligacy of Brando the director, burning up a million and a half feet of expensive VistaVision film at 50 cents a foot, fully ten times the normal amount of raw stock expended during production of an equivalent motion picture. Brando took so long editing the film that he was never able to present the studio with a cut. Paramount took it away from him and tacked on a re-shot ending that Brando was dissatisfied with, as it made the Oedipal figure of Dad Longworth into a villain. In any normal film Dad would have been the heavy, but Brando believed that no one was innately evil, that it was a matter of an individual responding to, and being molded by, one\'s environment. It was not a black-and-white world, Brando felt, but a gray world in which once-decent people could do horrible things. This attitude explains his sympathetic portrayal of Nazi officer Christian Diestl in the film he made before shooting One-Eyed Jacks (1961), Edward Dmytryk\'s filming of Irwin Shaw\'s novel The Young Lions (1958). Shaw denounced Brando\'s performance, but audiences obviously disagreed, as the film was a major hit. It would be the last hit movie Brando would have for more than a decade.One-Eyed Jacks (1961) generated respectable numbers at the box office, but the production costs were exorbitant - a then-staggering $6 million - which made it run a deficit. A film essentially is ""made"" in the editing room, and Brando found cutting to be a terribly boring process, which was why the studio eventually took the film away from him. Despite his proved talent in handling actors and a large production, Brando never again directed another film, though he would claim that all actors essentially direct themselves during the shooting of a picture.Between the production and release of One-Eyed Jacks (1961), Brando appeared in Sidney Lumet\'s film version of Tennessee Williams\' play ""Orpheus Descending"", The Fugitive Kind (1960) which teamed him with fellow Oscar winners Anna Magnani and Joanne Woodward. Following in Elizabeth Taylor\'s trailblazing footsteps, Brando became the second performer to receive a $1-million salary for a motion picture, so high were the expectations for this re-teaming of Kowalski and his creator (in 1961 critic Hollis Alpert had published a book ""Brando and the Shadow of Stanley Kowalski). Critics and audiences waiting for another incendiary display from Brando in a Williams work were disappointed when the renamed The Fugitive Kind (1960) finally released. Though Tennessee was hot, with movie versions of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958) and Suddenly, Last Summer (1959) burning up the box office and receiving kudos from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, The Fugitive Kind (1960) was a failure. This was followed by the so-so box-office reception of One-Eyed Jacks (1961) in 1961 and then by a failure of a more monumental kind: Mutiny on the Bounty (1962), a remake of the famed 1935 film.Brando signed on to Mutiny on the Bounty (1962) after turning down the lead in the David Lean classic Lawrence of Arabia (1962) because he didn\'t want to spend a year in the desert riding around on a camel. He received another $1-million salary, plus $200,000 in overages as the shoot went overtime and over budget. During principal photography, highly respected director Carol Reed (an eventual Academy Award winner) was fired, and his replacement, two-time Oscar winner Lewis Milestone, was shunted aside by Brando as Marlon basically took over the direction of the film himself. The long shoot became so notorious that President John F. Kennedy asked director Billy Wilder at a cocktail party not ""when"" but ""if"" the ""Bounty"" shoot would ever be over. The MGM remake of one of its classic Golden Age films garnered a Best Picture Oscar nomination and was one of the top grossing films of 1962, yet failed to go into the black due to its Brobdingnagian budget estimated at $20 million, which is equivalent to $120 million when adjusted for inflation.Brando and Taylor, whose Cleopatra (1963) nearly bankrupted 20th Century-Fox due to its huge cost overruns (its final budget was more than twice that of Brando\'s Mutiny on the Bounty (1962)), were pilloried by the show business press for being the epitome of the pampered, self-indulgent stars who were ruining the industry. Seeking scapegoats, the Hollywood press conveniently ignored the financial pressures on the studios. The studios had been hurt by television and by the antitrust-mandated divestiture of their movie theater chains, causing a large outflow of production to Italy and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s in order to lower costs. The studio bosses, seeking to replicate such blockbuster hits as the remakes of The Ten Commandments (1956) and Ben-Hur (1959), were the real culprits behind the losses generated by large-budgeted films that found it impossible to recoup their costs despite long lines at the box office.While Elizabeth Taylor, receiving the unwanted gift of reams of publicity from her adulterous romance with Cleopatra (1963) co-star Richard Burton, remained hot until the tanking of her own Tennessee Williams-renamed debacle Boom (1968), Brando from 1963 until the end of the decade appeared in one box-office failure after another as he worked out a contract he had signed with Universal Pictures. The industry had grown tired of Brando and his idiosyncrasies, though he continued to be offered prestige projects up through 1968.Some of the films Brando made in the 1960s were noble failures, such as The Ugly American (1963), The Appaloosa (1966) and Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967). For every ""Reflections,"" though, there seemed to be two or three outright debacles, such as Bedtime Story (1964), Morituri (1965), The Chase (1966), A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), Candy (1968), The Night of the Following Day (1969). By the time Brando began making the anti-colonialist picture Queimada (1969) in Colombia with Gillo Pontecorvo in the director\'s chair, he was box-office poison, despite having worked in the previous five years with such top directors as Arthur Penn, John Huston and the legendary Charles Chaplin, and with such top-drawer co-stars as David Niven, Yul Brynner, Sophia Loren and Taylor.The rap on Brando in the 1960s was that a great talent had ruined his potential to be America\'s answer to Laurence Olivier, as his friend William Redfield limned the dilemma in his book ""Letters from an Actor"" (1967), a memoir about Redfield\'s appearance in Burton\'s 1964 theatrical production of ""Hamlet."" By failing to go back on stage and recharge his artistic batteries, something British actors such as Burton were not afraid to do, Brando had stifled his great talent, by refusing to tackle the classical repertoire and contemporary drama. Actors and critics had yearned for an American response to the high-acting style of the Brits, and while Method actors such as Rod Steiger tried to create an American style, they were hampered in their quest, as their king was lost in a wasteland of Hollywood movies that were beneath his talent. Many of his early supporters now turned on him, claiming he was a crass sellout.Despite evidence in such films as The Appaloosa (1966) and Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967) that Brando was in fact doing some of the best acting of his life, critics, perhaps with an eye on the box office, slammed him for failing to live up to, and nurture, his great gift. Brando\'s political activism, starting in the early 1960s with his championing of Native Americans\' rights, followed by his participation in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference\'s March on Washington in 1963, and followed by his appearance at a Black Panther rally in 1968, did not win him many admirers in the establishment. In fact, there was a de facto embargo on Brando films in the recently segregated (officially, at least) southeastern US in the 1960s. Southern exhibitors simply would not book his films, and producers took notice. After 1968, Brando would not work for three years.Pauline Kael wrote of Brando that he was Fortune\'s fool. She drew a parallel with the latter career of John Barrymore, a similarly gifted thespian with talents as prodigious, who seemingly threw them away. Brando, like the late-career Barrymore, had become a great ham, evidenced by his turn as the faux Indian guru in the egregious Candy (1968), seemingly because the material was so beneath his talent. Most observers of Brando in the 1960s believed that he needed to be reunited with his old mentor Elia Kazan, a relationship that had soured due to Kazan\'s friendly testimony naming names before the notorious House Un-American Activities Committee. Perhaps Brando believed this, too, as he originally accepted an offer to appear as the star of Kazan\'s film adaptation of his own novel, The Arrangement (1969). However, after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Brando backed out of the film, telling Kazan that he could not appear in a Hollywood film after this tragedy. Also reportedly turning down a role opposite box-office king Paul Newman in a surefire script, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), Brando decided to make Queimada (1969) with Pontecorvo. The film, a searing indictment of racism and colonialism, flopped at the box office but won the esteem of progressive critics and cultural arbiters such as Howard Zinn. He subsequently appeared in the British film The Nightcomers (1971), a prequel to ""Turn of the Screw"" and another critical and box office failure.Kazan, after a life in film and the theater, said that, aside from Orson Welles, whose greatness lay in filmmaking, he only met one actor who was a genius: Brando. Richard Burton, an intellectual with a keen eye for observation if not for his own film projects, said that he found Brando to be very bright, unlike the public perception of him as a Terry Malloy-type character that he himself inadvertently promoted through his boorish behavior. Brando\'s problem, Burton felt, was that he was unique, and that he had gotten too much fame too soon at too early an age. Cut off from being nurtured by normal contact with society, fame had distorted Brando\'s personality and his ability to cope with the world, as he had not had time to grow up outside the limelight.Truman Capote, who eviscerated Brando in print in the mid-\'50s and had as much to do with the public perception of the dyslexic Brando as a dumbbell, always said that the best actors were ignorant, and that an intelligent person could not be a good actor. However, Brando was highly intelligent, and possessed of a rare genius in a then-deprecated art, acting. The problem that an intelligent performer has in movies is that it is the director, and not the actor, who has the power in his chosen field. Greatness in the other arts is defined by how much control the artist is able to exert over his chosen medium, but in movie acting, the medium is controlled by a person outside the individual artist. It is an axiom of the cinema that a performance, as is a film, is ""created"" in the cutting room, thus further removing the actor from control over his art. Brando had tried his hand at directing, in controlling the whole artistic enterprise, but he could not abide the cutting room, where a film and the film\'s performances are made. This lack of control over his art was the root of Brando\'s discontent with acting, with movies, and, eventually, with the whole wide world that invested so much cachet in movie actors, as long as ""they"" were at the top of the box-office charts. Hollywood was a matter of ""they"" and not the work, and Brando became disgusted.Charlton Heston, who participated in Martin Luther King\'s 1963 March on Washington with Brando, believes that Marlon was the great actor of his generation. However, noting a story that Brando had once refused a role in the early 1960s with the excuse ""How can I act when people are starving in India?"", Heston believes that it was this attitude, the inability to separate one\'s idealism from one\'s work, that prevented Brando from reaching his potential. As Rod Steiger once said, Brando had it all, great stardom and a great talent. He could have taken his audience on a trip to the stars, but he simply would not. Steiger, one of Brando\'s children even though a contemporary, could not understand it. When James Mason\' was asked in 1971 who was the best American actor, he had replied that since Brando had let his career go belly-up, it had to be George C. Scott, by default.Paramount thought that only Laurence Olivier would suffice, but Lord Olivier was ill. The young director believed there was only one actor who could play godfather to the group of Young Turk actors he had assembled for his film, The Godfather of method acting himself - Marlon Brando. Francis Ford Coppola won the fight for Brando, Brando won - and refused - his second Oscar, and Paramount won a pot of gold by producing the then top-grossing film of all-time, The Godfather (1972), a gangster movie most critics now judge one of the greatest American films of all time. Brando followed his iconic portrayal of Don Corleone with his Oscar-nominated turn in the high-grossing and highly scandalous Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972) (""Last Tango in Paris""), the first film dealing explicitly with sexuality in which an actor of Brando\'s stature had participated. He was now again a Top-Ten box office star and once again heralded as the greatest actor of his generation, an unprecedented comeback that put him on the cover of ""Time"" magazine and would make him the highest-paid actor in the history of motion pictures by the end of the decade. Little did the world know that Brando, who had struggled through many projects in good faith during the 1960s, delivering some of his best acting, only to be excoriated and ignored as the films did not do well at the box office, essentially was through with the movies.After reaching the summit of his career, a rarefied atmosphere never reached before or since by any actor, Brando essentially walked away. He would give no more of himself after giving everything as he had done in Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972)"", a performance that embarrassed him, according to his autobiography. Brando had come as close to any actor to being the ""auteur,"" or author, of a film, as the English-language scenes of ""Tango"" were created by encouraging Brando to improvise. The improvisations were written down and turned into a shooting script, and the scripted improvisations were shot the next day. Pauline Kael, the Brando of movie critics in that she was the most influential arbiter of cinematic quality of her generation and spawned a whole legion of Kael wanna-bes, said Brando\'s performance in Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972) had revolutionized the art of film. Brando, who had to act to gain his mother\'s attention; Brando, who believed acting at best was nothing special as everyone in the world engaged in it every day of their lives to get what they wanted from other people; Brando, who believed acting at its worst was a childish charade and that movie stardom was a whorish fraud, would have agreed with Sam Peckinpah\'s summation of Pauline Kael: ""Pauline\'s a brilliant critic but sometimes she\'s just cracking walnuts with her ass."" Probably in a simulacrum of those words, too.After another three-year hiatus, Brando took on just one more major role for the next 20 years, as the bounty hunter after Jack Nicholson in Arthur Penn\'s The Missouri Breaks (1976), a western that succeeded neither with the critics or at the box office. Following The Godfather and Tango, Brando\'s performance was disappointing for some reviewers, who accused him of giving an erratic and inconsistent performance. In 1977, Brando made a rare appearance on television in the miniseries Roots: The Next Generations (1979), portraying George Lincoln Rockwell; he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his performance. In 1978, he narrated the English version of Raoni (1978), a French-Belgian documentary film directed by Jean-Pierre Dutilleux and Luiz Carlos Saldanha that focused on the life of Raoni Metuktire and issues surrounding the survival of the indigenous Indian tribes of north central Brazil.Later in his career, Brando concentrated on extracting the maximum amount of capital for the least amount of work from producers, as when he got the Salkind brothers to pony up a then-record $3.7 million against 10% of the gross for 13 days work on Superman (1978). Factoring in inflation, the straight salary for ""Superman"" equals or exceeds the new record of $1 million a day Harrison Ford set with K-19: The Widowmaker (2002). He agreed to the role only on assurance that he would be paid a large sum for what amounted to a small part, that he would not have to read the script beforehand, and his lines would be displayed somewhere off-camera. Brando also filmed scenes for the movie\'s sequel, Superman II, but after producers refused to pay him the same percentage he received for the first movie, he denied them permission to use the footage.Before cashing his first paycheck for Superman (1978), Brando had picked up $2 million for his extended cameo in Francis Ford Coppola\'s Apocalypse Now (1979) in a role, that of Col. Kurtz, that he authored on-camera through improvisation while Coppola shot take after take. It was Brando\'s last bravura star performance. He co-starred with George C. Scott and John Gielgud in The Formula (1980), but the film was another critical and financial failure. Years later though, he did receive an eighth and final Oscar nomination for his supporting role in A Dry White Season (1989) after coming out of a near-decade-long retirement. Contrary to those who claimed he now only was in it for the money, Brando donated his entire seven-figure salary to an anti-apartheid charity. He then did an amusing performance in the comedy The Freshman (1990), winning rave reviews. He portrayed Tomas de Torquemada in the historical drama 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992), but his performance was denounced and the film was another box office failure. He made another comeback in the Johnny Depp romantic drama Don Juan DeMarco (1994), which co-starred Faye Dunaway as his wife. He then appeared in The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996), co-starring Val Kilmer, who he didn\'t get along with. The filming was an unpleasant experience for Brando, as well as another critical and box office failure.Brando had first attracted media attention at the age of 24, when ""Life"" magazine ran a photo of himself and his sister Jocelyn, who were both then appearing on Broadway. The curiosity continued, and snowballed. Playing the paraplegic soldier of The Men (1950), Brando had gone to live at a Veterans Administration hospital with actual disabled veterans, and confined himself to a wheelchair for weeks. It was an acting method, research, that no one in Hollywood had ever heard of before, and that willingness to experience life.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Jon C.

[October 1997]      He balked at the prospect of Burt Reynolds in the role of Santino Corleone in The Godfather (1972).      Eldest son Christian Brando was arrested for murdering his half-sister\'s boyfriend Dag Drollet in 1990. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison in March 1991 and released in January 1996.      Worked as a department store elevator operator before he became famous. He quit after four days due to his embarrassment in having to call out the lingerie floor.      Was roommates with childhood friend Wally Cox during his theatrical training in New York City. The two remained lifelong friends, and Brando took Cox\'s sudden death from a heart attack at age 48 extremely hard.      Chosen by Empire magazine as one of the 100 Sexiest Stars in film history (#14) (1995).      Two years before Brando declined his Oscar for Best Actor in The Godfather (1972), he had applied to the Academy to replace the one he had won for On the Waterfront (1954), which had been stolen. Prior to its theft, Brando had been using the Oscar as a doorstop.      Owned a private island off the Pacific coast, the Polynesian atoll known as Tetiaroa, from 1966 until his death in 2004.      Native of Omaha, Nebraska. His mother once gave stage lessons to Henry Fonda, another Nebraska native.      Lived on infamous ""Bad Boy Drive"" (Muholland Drive in Beverly Hills, California), which received its nickname because its residents were famous ""bad boy"" actors Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty and Brando.      Was the youngest of three children of Marlon Brando Sr. and Dorothy Pennebaker Brando.      His son Miko C. Brando was once a bodyguard for Michael Jackson. Jackson and Brando remained good friends thereafter.      Born to alcoholic parents, Brando was left alone much of the time as a child.      While filming The Score (2001), he refused to be on the set at the same time as director Frank Oz, referring to the former ""Muppets"" director as ""Miss Piggy"".      Younger brother of actress Jocelyn Brando, who appeared with him in The Ugly American (1963) and The Chase (1966).      Daughter Cheyenne committed suicide in 1995, aged 25.      In April 2002, a woman filed a $100-million palimony lawsuit in California against Brando, claiming he fathered her three children during a 14-year romantic relationship. Maria Cristina Ruiz, 43, filed the breach-of-contract suit, demanding damages and living expenses. The lawsuit was settled in April 2003.      Ranked #12 in Entertainment Weekly\'s ""Top 100 Entertainers"" of all time (2000).      Received more money for his short appearance as Jor-El in Superman (1978) than Christopher Reeve did in the title role. Brando later sued for a percentage of the film\'s profits.      He used cue cards in many of his movies because he refused to memorize his lines. His lines were written on the diaper of the baby, ""Kal-El"", in Superman (1978).      One of the innovators of the Method acting technique in American film.      Was mentioned in La dolce vita (1960) in a discussion about salary paid to film stars.      Adopted child: Petra Barrett Brando, whose biological father is author James Clavell and biological mother is Caroline Barrett.      Said that the only reason he continued to make movies was in order to raise the money to produce what he said would be the ""definitive"" film about Native Americans. The film was never made.      Expelled from high school for riding a motorcycle through the halls.      His signature was considered so valuable to collectors, that many personal checks he wrote were never cashed because his signature was usually worth more than the amount on the check.      Studied at the Dramatic Workshop at the New School for Social Research in New York City.      Mentioned in Neil Young\'s song ""Pocahontas"", David Bowie\'s song ""China Girl"", Bruce Springsteen\'s song ""It\'s Hard to Be a Saint in the City"", and Billy Joel\'s song ""We Didn\'t Start the Fire"".      Appeared on the front sleeve of The Beatles\' classic album ""Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band"" as Johnny in The Wild One (1953).      Brando\'s first wife was Anna Kashfi, who bore him a son whom they named Christian. His second wife was Movita Castenada, who played the Tahitian love interest of Lt. Byam in Mutiny on the Bounty (1935). His third wife was Tarita Teriipia, who played the Tahitian love interest of Lt. Fletcher Christian in Mutiny on the Bounty (1962).      Had English, as well as smaller amounts (to varying degrees) of Dutch, French, German, Irish, Scottish and Welsh, ancestry. He is descended from Johann Wilhelm Brandau (b. 1670), who was a German immigrant. The surname was eventually changed to ""Brando"". One of Marlon\'s maternal great-grandfathers, Myles Joseph Gahan, emigrated to the United States from Ireland.      Helped out a great deal of minorities in America, including African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native American Indians.      He reputedly suggested that his cameo role as Jor-El in Superman (1978) be done by him in voice-over only, with the character\'s image onscreen being a glowing, levitating green bagel. Unsure if Brando was joking or not, the film\'s producers formally rejected the suggestion.Russell Crowe wrote and sang a song about him called ""I Wanna Be Marlon Brando"".      He was offered a chance to reprise his role as Vito Corleone in The Godfather: Part II (1974) and Jor El in Superman II (1980), but he turned them both down due to his own credo that once he finished a role, he put it away and moved on. He turned down both films despite being offered three times more money than any of his co-stars.      Is one of the many movie stars mentioned in Madonna\'s song ""Vogue"".      Film critic Roger Ebert praised Brando as ""the Greatest Actor in the World"".      Empire magazine profiled him as part of their ""Greatest Living Actors"" series. The issue containing this feature was published a week before his death.      He was voted the 7th ""Greatest Movie Star"" of all time by Entertainment Weekly.      Biographer Peter Manso said that at the time of production of flops such as The Appaloosa (1966), Brando had turned down the leading role of a Hamlet production in England, with Laurence Olivier.      Mentioned in the song ""The Ballad of Michael Valentine"" by The Killers, the song ""American Horse"" by The Cult, and the song ""Eyeless"" by the heavy metal band Slipknot.      During an acting class, when the students were told to act out ""a chicken hearing an air-raid siren"", most of the students clucked and flapped their arms in a panic, while Brando stood stock-still, staring up at the ceiling. When asked to explain himself, Brando replied, ""I\'m a chicken - I don\'t know what an air-raid siren is."".      Received top billing in nearly every film he appeared in, even if not cast in the lead role.      Was offered $2 million for four days work to appear as a priest in Scary Movie 2 (2001) but had to withdraw when he was hospitalized with pneumonia in April 2001. Consequently, the role was played by James Woods.      In his book ""The Way It\'s Never Been Done Before: My Friendship with Marlon Brando"", George Englund relates how Brando told him a couple of years before his death that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences offered him a Lifetime Achievement Oscar on the condition that he attend the ceremony to personally accept the award. Brando refused, believing that the offer should not be conditional, and that the condition that he appear on the televised ceremony showed that the Academy was not primarily focused on honoring artistic excellence.      He was reportedly interested in making a film of Rolf Hochhuth\'s controversial play ""The Deputy"", an indictment of the alleged silence of Pope Pius XII (God\'s ""Deputy"" on Earth) over the Nazi persecution of the Jews during World War II. The film was never made.      He attended a staging of Eugene O\'Neill\'s autobiographical ""Long Day\'s Journey Into Night"" with an eye towards starring in a proposed film of the play. The play deals with the drug addiction of Mary Tyrone, modeled after O\'Neil\'s own mother, which, along with her husband\'s miserliness and her oldest son\'s alcoholism, has blighted her youngest son\'s life. When asked his opinion of the play, Brando, whose mother was an alcoholic and had died relatively young in 1954, replied, ""Lousy"". Jason Robards, who originated the role of older son James Tyrone, Jr. in the original Broadway production in 1956, subsequently appeared in Sidney Lumet\'s 1962 movie.      He was reportedly once interested in playing Pablo Picasso on film and was trying to reduce weight on a banana diet. The film was never made.      In his autobiography, he said that he was physically attracted to Vivien Leigh during the making of A Streetcar Named Desire (1951). However, he could not bring himself to seduce her, as he found her husband, Laurence Olivier, to be such a ""nice guy"".      According to friend George Englund in his book ""The Way It\'s Never Been Done Before: My Friendship with Marlon Brando"", he testified at the manslaughter trial of his son Christian Brando that his mother and father and one of his two sisters had been alcoholics.      Paramount studio brass wanted him to appear as Jay Gatsby in The Great Gatsby (1974), but he wanted $4 million, an unheard-of salary at the time.      Director Francis Ford Coppola wanted Brando to appear as Preston Tucker Jr. in his biopic of the maverick automotive executive he planned to make after he completed The Godfather: Part II (1974). Brando was not interested but did appear in Apocalypse Now (1979), the film Coppola actually did make after finishing The Godfather (1972) sequel. When Coppola finally got around to making the film Tucker: The Man and His Dream (1988), he cast Jeff Bridges in the role.      According to co-producer Fred Roos, Brando was scheduled to make a cameo appearance in The Godfather: Part II (1974), specifically in the flashback at the film\'s ending in which Vito Corleone comes back to his home and is greeted with a surprise birthday party. In fact, he was expected the day of shooting but did not show up due to a salary dispute. According to Francis Ford Coppola, he had not been paid for The Godfather (1972) and thus would not appear in the sequel.      Was a huge fan of Afro-Caribbean music, and changed from being a strict drummer to the congas after becoming enthralled by the music in New York City in the 1940s.      Took possession of friend Wally Cox\'s ashes from his widow in order to scatter them at sea but actually kept them hidden in a closet at his house. In his autobiography, Brando said he frequently talked to Cox. The Los Angeles Times on September 22, 2004 quoted Brando\'s son, Miko, to the effect that both his father\'s and Cox\'s ashes were scattered at the same time in Death Valley, California in a ceremony following Brando\'s death.      Asked The Godfather (1972) co-star James Caan what he would want if his wishes came true. When Caan answered that he would like to be in love, Brando answered, ""Me too. But don\'t tell my wife."".      Was scheduled to appear in the David Lean-directed ""Nostromo"" (1991), but when Lean died, the production came to a halt. Thus, the world missed the last of three chances to see one of the world\'s greatest actors work with one of the world\'s greatest directors. Producer Sam Spiegel, who had won an Oscar for On the Waterfront (1954), offered Brando the title role in Lean\'s Lawrence of Arabia (1962), which he turned down, saying he did not want to ride camels in the desert for two years. Brando was Lean\'s first choice for the male lead in Ryan\'s Daughter (1970), but Brando, who at that time was considered box office poison by movie studios, never was offered the role.      Brando tried to join the Army during World War II but was rejected due to a knee injury he had sustained while playing football at Shattuck Military Academy. After he made The Men (1950), the Korean War broke out, and he was ordered by the draft board to report for a physical prior to induction. As his knee was better due to an operation, he initially was reclassified from 4-F to 1-A, but the military again rejected him, this time for mental problems, as he was under psychoanalysis.      The story about his mother his character Paul tells Jeanne in Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972), about how she taught him to appreciate nature, which he illustrates with his reminiscence of his dog Dutchy hunting rabbits in a mustard field, is real, based on his own recollections of his past.      His best friend was Wally Cox, whom he had known as a child and then met again when both were aspiring actors in New York during the 1940s. According to Brando\'s autobiography, there was not a day that went by when he did not think of Wally. So close did he feel to Cox, he even kept the pajamas he died in.      Studied modern dance with Katherine Dunham in New York in the early 1940s and briefly considered becoming a dancer.      Considered Montgomery Clift a friend and a ""very good actor"". They were not rivals, as the public perceived them to be during the 1950s. After Clift died of a heart attack in 1966, Brando took over his role in Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967).      Just after the end of World War II, he met then-unknown James Baldwin and Norman Mailer at a cafeteria in New York. He became friends with Baldwin, a friendship that lasted until Baldwin\'s death.      Shortly before his death in 2004, he gave EA Games permission to use his voice for its video game The Godfather (2006).      After a decade of being considered ""box-office poison"" after the large losses generated by the big-budget remake of Mutiny on the Bounty (1962), the twin successes of The Godfather (1972) and Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972) made Brando a superstar again. He was named the #6 and #10 top money-making star in 1972 and 1973, respectively, by the Motion Picture Herald. The top 10 box-office list was based on an annual poll of movie exhibitors in the United States as to the drawing power of stars, conducted by Quigley Publications. Brando used his unique combination of box-office power and his reputation as the greatest actor in the world to command huge salaries throughout the decade, culminating in the record $3.7 million for 12 days work paid him for Superman (1978) by Alexander Salkind and Ilya Salkind. Factored for inflation, his adjusted salary of $11.25 million in 2002 terms equals almost $1 million a day, a record that stood until Harrison Ford breached it for K-19: The Widowmaker (2002).      Even before he let himself get obese and balloon up to over 350 lb., his eating habits were legendary. The Men (1950) co-star Richard Erdman claimed Brando\'s diet circa 1950 consisted ""mainly of junk food, usually take-out Chinese or peanut butter, which he consumed by the jarful"". By the mid-1950s, he was renowned for eating boxes of Mallomars and cinnamon buns, washing them down with a quart of milk. Close friend Carlo Fiore wrote that in the 1950s and early 1960s, Brando went on crash diets before his films commenced shooting, but when he lost his willpower he would eat huge breakfasts consisting of corn flakes, sausages, eggs, bananas and cream, and a huge stack of pancakes drenched in syrup. Fiore was detailed by producers to drag him out of coffee shops. Karl Malden claimed that, during the shooting of One-Eyed Jacks (1961), Brando would have ""two steaks, potatoes, two apple pies a la mode and a quart of milk"" for dinner, necessitating constant altering of his costumes. During a birthday party for Brando--the film\'s director as well as star--the crew gave him a belt with a card reading, ""Hope it fits."" A sign was placed below the birthday cake saying, ""Don\'t feed the director."" He reportedly ate at least four pieces of cake that day. His second wife Movita, who had a lock put on their refrigerator to stop pilfering by what she thought was the household staff, awoke one morning to find the lock broken and teeth marks on a round of cheese. The maid told her that Brando nightly raided the fridge. Movita also related how he often drove down to hot dog stands late at night (one of his favorite spots was the legendary Pink\'s Hot Dogs in Hollywood; it was open 24 hours a day, and Brando would go there at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning and polish off a half-dozen hot dogs at a time). Mutiny on the Bounty (1962) costumer James Taylor claimed that Brando split the seat on 52 pairs of pants during the shooting of the film, necessitating that stretch fabric be sewn into his replacement duds. He split those, too. Ice cream was the culprit: Brando would purloin a five-gallon tub of the fattening dessert, row himself out into the lagoon and indulge. On the set of The Appaloosa (1966), Brando\'s double often had to be used for shooting after lunch, and filming could only proceed in long shots, as Brando could no longer fit into his costumes. Dick Loving, who was married to Brando\'s sister Frannie, said that Brando used to eat ""two chickens at a sitting, and [go] through bags of Pepperidge Farm cookies."" It was reported during the filming of The Missouri Breaks (1976) that the environmentally sensitive Brando fished a frog out of a pond, took a huge bite out of the hapless amphibian, and threw it back into the drink. Living on his island of Tetioroa, Brando created what he called ""real-life Mounds Bars"" by cracking open a coconut, melting some chocolate in the sun, then stirring it into the coconut for a tasty treat. By the 1980s, there were reports that one of his girlfriends had left him because he failed to keep his promise of losing weight. He seemed to be dieting, but to her astonishment, he never lost weight. She found out that his buddies had been throwing bags of Burger King Whoppers over the gates of his Mulholland Dr. estate late at night to relieve the hunger pangs of their famished friend. In the late 1980s, Brando was spotted regularly buying ice cream from a Beverly Hills ice cream shop--five gallons at a time. He supposedly confessed that he was eating it all himself. Finally, a reported Brando snack was a pound of cooked bacon shoved into an entire loaf of bread. When Brando became sick, he seriously cut back and lost 70 pounds on a bland diet, but never lost his love of food and especially ice cream.      Won his seventh, and last, Best Actor Oscar nomination in 1974, for Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972), after he had generated much ill-will in Hollywood by refusing his Oscar for The Godfather (1972). Academy President Walter Mirisch said of the nomination, ""I think it speaks well for the Academy. It proves that voting members are interested only in performances, not in sidelights."" Interestingly, the only other actor to refuse an Academy Award, George C. Scott, also was nominated as Best Actor the year following his snubbing of the Academy. So far, Brando, Scott and screenwriter Dudley Nichols, who refused to accept his 1935 Oscar for the movie The Informer (1935) due to a Writers Guild strike, are the only people out of more than 2,000 winners to turn down the Award.      In his September 1972 Playboy magazine interview, director Sam Peckinpah said that a problem with One-Eyed Jacks (1961) is that Brando would not play a villain. Peckinpah had worked on rewriting the script, which was based on the novel ""The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones"", a retelling of the Billy the Kid legend. According to Peckinpah, Billy the Kid was a genuine villain, whereas Brando\'s character ""Rio"" was not, thus lessening the dramatic impact of the story. He praised Brando for his acting comeback as Don Corleone in The Godfather (1972), both as the return of a great actor and as an example of Brando\'s newfound willingness to shuck off his old predilection and actually play a villain.      At the 77th Academy Awards ceremony, he was the last person featured in the film honoring film industry personalities who had passed away the previous year.      At the 27th Academy Awards, held March 30, 1955, at the RKO Pantages Theatre in Hollywood, Brando chewed gum throughout the ceremony, according to columnist Sidney Skolsky. When Bette Davis came out to present the Best Actor Oscar, Brando stopped chewing. When she announced him as the winner, Brando took the gum out of his mouth and shook hands with fellow nominee Bing Crosby, who had been reckoned the favorite that night, before going on stage to accept the statuette.Bette Davis, who had presented Brando with his first Best Actor Oscar at the 27th Academy Awards in 1955, told the press that she was thrilled he had won. She elaborated, ""He and I had much in common. He, too, had made many enemies. He, too, is a perfectionist."".      When participating in the March on Washington, brandished a cattle prod to show the world the brutality blacks faced in the South.      Attended the memorial service for slain Black Panthers member Bobby Hutton.      Tithed a tenth of his income to various black civil-rights organizations such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.      He and director Tony Kaye paid 350,000 pounds sterling for footage of what allegedly is the ""Angel of Mons"", according to The Sunday Times (March 11, 2001). The Angel of Mons was an apparition that legend holds appeared in the skies during the British Expeditionary Force\'s first encounter with the Imperial German army during World War I, which enabled a successful retreat by the BEF. The film allegedly was found in August 1999 in a junk-shop, which had a trunk belonging to a man called William Doidge, a World War I veteran. Doidge had been at Mons in August 1914 and knew about or possibly saw the apparition in the sky as the British army retreated before the overwhelming German advance. After the war he became obsessed by these apparitions. An American war veteran told him in 1952 that angels had appeared before some American troops were drowned during an exercise in 1944 at Woodchester Park in the Cotswolds. Doidge went there with a movie camera and supposedly captured images of them. Kaye planned to make a film of the incident, starring Brando as the American veteran, but the plans fell through when the two fell out over an acting video.      The news agency Reuters, in an article about about Vanity Fair magazine\'s upcoming Hollywood issue, reported after his death that Brando repeatedly voiced objections to appearing in The Godfather (1972). According to Brando\'s friend Budd Schulberg, who won an Oscar writing the screenplay for On the Waterfront (1954), Brando repeatedly told his assistant Alice Marchak that he would not be in a film that glorified the Mafia. Schulberg said that Marchak pestered him to read the bestseller, and at one point he threw the book at her, saying, ""For the last time, I won\'t glorify the Mafia!"" However, Marchak noticed that Brando subsequently began toying with the idea of a mustache to play Don Corleone, at first drawing one on with an eyebrow pencil and asking her, ""How do I look?"" ""Like George Raft,"" she replied. Marchak told Schulberg this went on for awhile, with Brando trying different mustaches, until he finally won the role after agreeing to a screen test. Among the actors he beat out for the role were Laurence Olivier, who was too sick to work on the film, and Burt Lancaster, who had offered to do a screen test for the role and was looked on favorably by Paramount brass.      He was voted the 15th Greatest Movie Star of all time by Premiere magazine.      Was named #4 Actor on the 50 Greatest Screen Legends list by the American Film Institute.      Mentioned in the song ""Risen Within"" by MC Homicide featuring Paz.      He constantly referred to his good friend Johnny Depp as ""the most talented actor of his generation"".      His mother gave him an odd pet: a raccoon he named Russell.      He liked to box. While performing as Stanley Kowalski in the stage version of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", he would often persuade a member of the stage crew to spar with him in a room underneath the stage between his acts. During one of these impromptu boxing matches, a crew member surprised him with a hard punch to the nose. Brando\'s nose was broken so badly that it literally was split across its bridge. He managed to go on stage and finish the play despite the fact that backstage efforts to stanch the bleeding had failed, but he was taken to the hospital immediately after. His famous broken-beak nose was the result of his having taken off his bandages in order to cover his nose with Mercurochrome to make it look particularly bad when he was visited by the play\'s producer, Irene Mayer Selznick. The subterfuge worked, as Selznick gave him two weeks off from the grind of the play (he was on stage with ""Streetcar"" for two years), but by taking the bandages off, his nose did not properly set.      Believed that he could control stress in his life and physical pain through meditation. So sure he was of this, that he wanted to prove it. When he decided in the early 1990s to be circumcised, he wanted the doctor to do the operation with no anesthesia so that he could show off this skill. The doctor refused because of medical ethics, but Brando underwent the operation anyway after receiving a painkilling shot in his back. However, he wanted to show the doctors what he could do, and he asked them to take his blood pressure. Through meditation, he brought his blood pressure down more than 20 points.Elton John\'s song ""Goodbye Marlon Brando"" was inspired by the actor\'s retirement in 1980.      His The Night of the Following Day (1969) co-star Richard Boone directed the final scenes of the film at the insistence of Brando, who could no longer tolerate what he considered the incompetence of director Hubert Cornfield. The film is generally considered the nadir of Brando\'s career.      A collection of personal effects from Brando\'s estate fetched $2,378,300 at a June 30, 2005 auction at Christie\'s New York. His annotated script from The Godfather (1972) was bought for a world record $312,800. ""Godfather"" memorabilia were the most sought-after items at the 6.5-hour auction, which attracted over 500 spectators and bidders and multiple telephone bids. Brando\'s annotated film script originally was figured to sell at between $10,000 and $15,000, but brought more than 20 times the high end of the pre-auction estimate. The previous record for a film script bought at auction was $244,500 for Clark Gable\'s Gone with the Wind (1939) script, which was auctioned at Christie\'s New York in 1996. A letter from ""Godfather"" writer Mario Puzo to Brando asking him to consider playing the role of Don Corleone in the movie version of his novel was bought for $132,000. A photograph of Brando and former lover Rita Moreno in The Night of the Following Day (1969), the only piece of film memorabilia he kept in his Mulholland Drive home, was bought for $48,000. A transcript of a telegram from Brando to Marilyn Monroe after her 1961 nervous breakdown was bought for $36,000. His extensive library of over 3,600 books was sold in lots, some of which fetched over $45,000; many of the books were annotated in Brando\'s own hand.      Shortly before his death, his doctors had told him that the only way to prolong his life would be to insert tubes carrying oxygen into his lungs. He refused permission, preferring to die naturally.      Was a licensed amateur (ham) radio operator with the call signs KE6PZH (his American license) and FO5GJ (is license for his home in French Polynesia). For both licenses, he used the name ""Martin Brandeaux"".      His decision to play the title role in The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996) turned out to be an offer that he definitely should have refused. He received the Worst Supporting Actor Razzie Award, beating Burt Reynolds, who was nominated for Striptease (1996), by a single vote. The vote was cast by Razzie Award founder John Wilson, who always chooses to vote last.      At the time of his death at age 80, Brando had been suffering from congestive heart failure, advanced diabetes and pulmonary fibrosis (damage to the tissue inside the lungs resulting from a bout of pneumonia in 2001). Doctors had recently discovered a tumor inside his liver, but he died before they could operate to remove it.      In a 1966 review of Brando\'s film The Chase (1966), film critic Rex Reed commented that ""most of the time, he sounds like he has a mouth full of wet toilet paper"".      Rode his own Triumph 6T Thunderbird, registration #63632, in The Wild One (1953).      Contrary to popular belief, Brando was not an atheist. At his son\'s trial, where he supposedly revealed his atheism and refused to swear upon a Bible, his actual words were, ""While I do believe in God, I do not believe in the same way as others, so I would prefer not to swear on the Bible."".Apocalypse Now (1979) was based on the novel ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad. Years after ""Apocalypse Now"" was released, a television film was made of Heart of Darkness (1993), which featured Ian McDiarmid in a small role. McDiarmid also appeared in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988), a remake of Bedtime Story (1964), a comedy film in which Brando appeared.      Both of his Oscar-winning roles have been referenced in the Oscar-winning roles of Robert De Niro. DeNiro played the younger version of his character, Vito Corleone, in The Godfather: Part II (1974). Brando\'s first Oscar was for On the Waterfront (1954), where his famous lines were ""I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I could been somebody."" DeNiro imitates this monologue in Raging Bull (1980), which won him his second Oscar.      When cast as Colonel Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola\'s Apocalypse Now (1979), Brando had promised to lose weight for the role, as well as read Joseph Conrad\'s novel ""Heart of Darkness"", on which Coppola\'s script was based. Coppola had envisioned Kurtz as a lean and hungry warrior; the character of Kurtz in the Conrad novellas was a wraith and weighed barely more than a child despite his great stature, due to his suffering from malaria. When the 52-year-old Brando--who had already been paid part of his huge salary--appeared on the set in the Philippines, he had lost none of the weight, so Coppola and cinematographer Vittorio Storaro were forced to put Brando\'s character in the shadows in most shots. In the penultimate appearance of Kurtz in the film, when he appears in silhouette in the doorway of his temple compound as the sacrificial bull is lead out, a very tall double (about 6\' 5"") was used to try to give the character a greater physical stature, rather than just Buddha-like belly-fat that girded the 5\' 10"" Brando. He did not get around to reading the novella until many years later.      He did not like to sign autographs for collectors. Because of this, his own autograph became so valuable that many checks he wrote went uncashed--his signature on them was worth more than the value of the check itself. Ironically, his secretary Alice Marchak remembered a time when a fan asked for his autograph. Brando promptly signed the fan\'s autograph book twice. Brando then told the fan that he had heard that one John Wayne autograph was equal to two Marlon Brando\'s on the collector\'s market.      After clashing with French director Claude Autant-Lara, Brando walked off production of Le rouge et le noir (1954).      In his 1976 biography ""The Only Contender"" by Gary Carey, Brando was quoted as saying, ""Like a large number of men, I, too, have had homosexual experiences, and I am not ashamed."".      It was his idea for Jor-El to wear the ""S"" insignia as the family crest in Superman (1978).      Is mentioned in Robbie Williams\' song ""Advertising Space"".      His performance as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront (1954) is ranked #2 on Premiere magazine\'s 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006).      His performance as Paul in Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972) is ranked #27 on Premiere magazine\'s 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006).      Was the first male actor to break the $1-million threshold when MGM offered him that amount to star in Mutiny on the Bounty (1962), its remake of its own 1935 classic. Brando had turned down the lead role in David Lean\'s masterpiece Lawrence of Arabia (1962), which had been offered by producer Sam Spiegel, because he did not like the lengthy shooting schedule. Ironically, ""Bounty"" itself wound up with an extensive shooting schedule due to a snail-pace schedule caused by a plethora of problems due to location shooting. With overages due to the extended shoot, Brando pocketed $1.25 million for the picture (approximately $8 million in 2005 dollars). Elizabeth Taylor had previously broken the million-dollar mark for a single picture with her renegotiated contract for Cleopatra (1963). Both films went vastly over schedule and wildly over budget and wound up hemorrhaging rivers of red ink despite relatively large grosses, though Taylor\'s flick outshone Brando\'s in the area of fiscal irresponsibility and wound up bankrupting its studio, 20th Century-Fox. Seventeen years later, after almost a decade of failure that caused him to be considered ""box office poison"" in the late 1960s/early 1970s (a string of flops that began with the failure of the ""Bounty"" remake), Brando became the highest paid actor in history with a $3.7-million up-front payment against a percentage of the gross for Superman (1978), a role that required his presence on the set for 12 days, plus an additional day for looping. Steve McQueen earlier had priced his services at $3 million a picture but had gotten no takers (many in Hollywood at the time believed he had deliberately set his price that high so he could take some time off). It was the price he quoted Francis Ford Coppola for his services for Apocalypse Now (1979), but Coppola refused to meet his demands and McQueen stayed off the screen for four years. Brando later appeared in the Coppola film in what is a supporting performance for a leading man/superstar salary of at least $2 million plus 8% of the gross over the negative cost. Brando made more money from his share of ""Apocalypse Now"" than from any other picture he appeared in; it financed his own retirement from the screen during the 1980s. After a decade off screen, so potent was the Brando name that he reportedly was paid over $2 million (donated to charity) for a supporting role in the anti-apartheid drama A Dry White Season (1989). Even toward the end of his life, when most of his contemporaries other than Paul Newman were no longer stars (Tony Curtis\'s asking price reportedly had dropped to $50,000 in the early 1990s) and could no longer command big money (Newman was the exception in that the financially secure superstar did not ask for big money), Brando could still command a $3-million salary for a supporting role in The Score (2001).The Chase (1966) producer Sam Spiegel was quite fond of Brando, who won his first Best Actor Oscar in the Spiegel-produced Best Picture winner On the Waterfront (1954). Spiegel was worried that motorcycle enthusiast Brando would kill himself like James Dean had, in an accident (Brando had had lacerated his knee while biking before filming began). Spiegel constantly queried ""Chase"" director Arthur Penn as to whether Brando had brought his motorcycle with him to the filming. When Brando got wind of this, he had the bike brought over to the set on a trailer and left on the lot to play a joke on Spiegel, who quickly arrived at the shooting to see that Brando did not drive it. When Spiegel found out it was all a joke, the normally taciturn producer laughed heartily. Spiegel originally had acquired the property that became ""The Chase"" in the 1950s and wanted Brando to play the role of Jason ""Jake"" Rogers and Marilyn Monroe to play his lover, Anna Reeves. By the time production began in 1965, Brando was too old to play the role of the son, and took the role of Sheriff Calder instead. Brando was paid $750,000 and his production company, Pennebaker, was paid a fee of $130,000 (Marlon\'s sister Jocelyn Brando was cast in the small role of Mrs. Briggs). Brando did not like the role, and complained that all he did in the picture was wander around. He began referring to himself as ""The Old Lamplighter"". However, many critics and cinephiles consider Sheriff Calder one of his best performances.      According to Lawrence Grobel\'s ""Conversations with Brando"" (NY: Hyperion, 1991), Brando ultimately made $14 million from Superman (1978). The Salkinds, producers of the movie, tried to buy out his share of the profits for $6 million, but Brando refused and had to file a lawsuit to recover what was owed him.      Was paid $3 million for 10 days work on The Formula (1980) (approximately $8.5 million in 2005 terms). Brando told Lawrence Grobel (""Conversations with Brando"") that the movie, which he only made for the money as he was broke, was ruined in the editing room, with the humor of his scenes cut out. In his autobiography, Brando--in a caption for a picture from the film--recounts that George C. Scott asked him during the shooting of the film whether he, Brando, would ever give the same line - reading twice. Brando replied, ""I know you know a cue when you hear one."" The two both played chess together during waits during the shooting. Scott said that Brando was not that good a player.      Brando had to sue Francis Ford Coppola to get all the money owed to him from his percentage of the profits of Apocalypse Now (1979). Brando characterized the people in the movie industry as ""liars"" to Lawrence Grobel (who conducted his 1979 Playboy interview): ""Even Francis Coppola owed me one-and-a-half million and I have to sue him. They all do that, as they make interest on the money... so they delay paying... It\'s all so ugly, I hate the idea of having to act, but there\'s no other way to do it."".      The producers of the film adaptation of Sir Peter Shaffer\'s play Equus (1977) were interested in casting either Brando or Jack Nicholson in the lead role of Dr. Martin Dysart. The role went instead to Richard Burton, who had to ""screen-test"" for the role by agreeing to appear in the play on Broadway. Burton did, got rave reviews and a special Tony Award, and won his seventh and last Oscar nomination for the role. In his diary, Burton wrote that in the late 1950s, he was always one of the first actors producers turned to when Brando turned down a role.      Became quite friendly with Elizabeth Taylor while shooting Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967). He agreed to pick up her Best Actress Award for Who\'s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) from the New York Film Critics Circle. When Brando made his appearance at the NYFCC Award ceremony at Sardi\'s on January 29, 1967, he badgered the critics, querying them as to why they had not recognized Liz before. He then flew to Dahomey, Africa, where Taylor was shooting The Comedians (1967) with husband Richard Burton to personally deliver the award. Brando later socialized with the Burtons, visiting them on their famous yacht the Kalizma, while they plied the Mediterreanean. Brando\'s ex-wife Anna Kashfi, in her book ""Brando for Breakfast"" (1979), claimed that Brando and Burton got into a fistfight aboard the yacht, probably over Liz, but nothing of the incident appears in Burton\'s voluminous diaries, in which Burton says he found Brando to be quite intelligent but believed he suffered, like Liz did, from becoming too famous too early in his life. He recognized Brando as a great actor, but felt he would have been more suited to silent films due to the deficiency in his voice (the famous ""mumble""). As a silent film star, Burton believed Brando would have been the greatest motion picture actor ever.      His performance as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) is ranked #85 on Premiere magazine\'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.      His performance as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront (1954) is ranked #69 on Premiere magazine\'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.      His monumental portrayal of Vito Corleone in the masterpiece The Godfather (1972) is the #1 Greatest Movie Character of All Time in Premiere magazine.      Was unable to raise the $10-million bail initially required of his son Christian Brando (Christian Brando) in the May 16, 1990, slaying of his sister Cheyenne\'s boyfriend Dag Drollet. After a two-day preliminary hearing in early August 1990, the presiding judge ruled that enough evidence had been presented to try Christian on first-degree murder charges. At that time, the judge refused to lower the $10-million bail due to what he termed evidence of the Brando family\'s failure to cooperate with he court, specifically citing Cheyenne\'s flight from the United States to avoid helping the police investigation. However, two weeks later the same judge reduced Christian\'s bail to $2 million, which Marlon was able to post by putting up his Mulholland Drive house as collateral. He soon accepted a cameo role in the film Christopher Columbus: The Discovery (1992) for $5 million, according to Variety magazine, the bible of the Hollywood trade papers.      Brando\'s friend, actor William Redfield, mentioned him prominently in the memoir he wrote about the 1964 stage production of ""Hamlet"" (later transferred to film as Hamlet (1964)) directed by John Gielgud and starring Richard Burton. In ""Letters from an Actor"" (1967, Viking Press), Redfield--who played Guildenstern--said that Brando had been considered the Great White Hope by his generation of American actors. That is, they believed that Brando\'s more naturalistic style, combined with his greatness as an actor, would prove a challenge to the more stylized and technical English acting paradigm epitomized by Laurence Olivier, and that Brando would supplant Olivier as the world\'s greatest actor. Redfield would tell Burton stories of Brando, whom the Welsh actor had not yet met. Redfield sadly confessed that Brando, by not taking on roles such as Hamlet (and furthermore, by betraying his craft by abandoning the stage, thus allowing his instrument to be dulled by film work), had failed not only as an actor, but had failed to help American actors create an acting tradition that would rival the English in terms of expertise.      He worked for union scale on the anti-apartheid film A Dry White Season (1989) with the proviso that the producers donate $3 million (which would have been his normal fee) to charity. When Brando was interviewed by Connie Chung for her television program Saturday Night with Connie Chung (1989), broadcast on October 7, 1989, he said he was upset with the picture and mentioned the charitable gift the producers had made on his bequest to show his commitment to toppling apartheid in South Africa. Brando could be generous at that time, as he appeared to be set financially for life due to his profit participation in Apocalypse Now (1979) and the $14-million settlement he won from Superman (1978) producer Ilya Salkind. However, the defense of his son Christian Brando, who was arrested for murder on May 16, 1990, reportedly cost his father as much as $5 million, so Brando was forced to go back to work after almost a decade away from the screen, but for the anti-apartheid picture and what he intended as his career swan-song, The Freshman (1990), for which he was paid $3 million (approximately $4.7 million in 2005 dollars). When he died in 2004, Brando left an estate valued at more than $20 million.      Turned down the role of the Sundance Kid in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) after Paul Newman took over the production from Steve McQueen. McQueen, who was obsessed with Newman as his rival as a movie actor and superstar, had bought the script from William Goldman, originally called ""The Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy"". McQueen was slated to play ""The Sundance Kid"". When he dropped out and Newman took over the production, the title was reversed and Brando was offered the role. He declined in order to film Queimada (1969) with Gillo Pontecorvo. Brando earlier had dropped out of Elia Kazan\'s The Arrangement (1969) shortly after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King. Brando told Kazan he could not star in a run-of-the-mill movie after King\'s assassination. Instead, he opted for ""Burn"", which was a pro-revolutionary story about a rebellion of African slaves in the Caribbean.      The very last film role that was ever offered to him was Rayburn in Man on Fire (2004), less than a year before he passed away. The role instead went to Christopher Walken.      Turned down the role of Earl Partridge in Magnolia (1999), which went to Jason Robards.      Turned down the role of the Headless Horseman in Sleepy Hollow (1999), which went to Christopher Walken.      Was considered by director Tim Burton for the role of the Penguin in Batman Returns (1992). Batman creator Bob Kane was relieved that he was not cast, as he considered Brando the ""wrongest possible choice for the role"".Keith Richards\'s son, Marlon Richards is named after him.      Signed on to appear in director Sidney Lumet\'s adaptation of the play Child\'s Play (1972) as schoolteacher Joseph Dobbs, but backed out just before principal photography was to begin when he realized James Mason had the better role as his schoolteacher rival. According to Bob Thomas\' ""Brando: Portrait of the Artist as a Rebel"", Brando quit the production when he realized his flagging career would soon be revitalized by the The Godfather (1972). A last-minute replacement, Robert Preston was signed to take over the role, and though a fine actor, he bombed in the performance due to over-projection of his voice (Preston had been playing mainly in the theater in the previous decade). Brando subsequently was sued by producer David Merrick. Ironically, both Brando and Mason were rivals for the role of Viktor Komarovsky in Doctor Zhivago (1965). Both were offered the role by David Lean, and both turned the role down.      Was offered the role of Viktor Komarovsky in Doctor Zhivago (1965) by double-Oscar winning director David Lean. However, a month went by and Brando failed to respond to Lean\'s written inquiry into whether he wanted to play Komarovsky, so the director offered the role to James Mason, who was a generation older than Brando. Lean decided on Mason, who initially accepted the role, as he did not want an actor who would overpower the character of Yuri Zhivago (specifically, to show Zhivago up as a lover of Lara, who would be played by the young Julie Christie, which the charismatic Brando might have done, shifting the sympathy of the audience). Mason eventually dropped out and Rod Steiger, who had just won the Silver Bear as Best Actor for his role as the eponymous The Pawnbroker (1964), accepted the role.      Made the Top 10 Poll of Money-Making Stars, as ranked by Quigley Publications\' annual survey of movie exhibitors, five times from 1954 to 1973. He debuted at #10 in 1954, and climbed to #6 in 1955 before falling off the list in 1956. He again made the list, as #4, in 1958. He did not appear on the list again until 1972, when he was ranked the #6 Box Office star after the extraordinary success of The Godfather (1972). He made one last appearance in 1973, going out as he had come onto the list, at #10.      Supported John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election.      Posthumously received the Stella Adler Award for Lifetime Achievement, presented by his friend and neighbor Warren Beatty to his son Miko C. Brando.      Brando\'s decision to send a Mexican actress named Maria Cruz--calling herself Sacheen Littlefeather--to refuse his Best Actor Oscar for The Godfather (1972) at The 45th Annual Academy Awards (1973) brought widespread condemnation. At the ceremony, Clint Eastwood remarked he did not know whether he should dedicate the Oscar he was presenting to ""all the cowboys shot in John Ford\'s westerns"". Michael Caine, nominated for his performance in Sleuth (1972), angrily condemned Brando\'s actions while Rock Hudson remarked, ""Sometimes to be eloquent is to be silent."".      He was close friends with the reclusive singer Michael Jackson for many years, even appearing in his music video ""You Rock My World"" in 2001. The last time Brando left his bungalow in Hollywood was to stay at Jackson\'s Neverland Ranch in the summer of 2003.      Brando\'s children: 1) From first marriage (with Anna Kashfi) = Christian Devi Brando aka Christian Brando (b. 1958); 2) From second marriage (with Movita Castaneda) = Miko C. Brando (b. 1961) and Rebecca Brando Kotlinzky (b. 1967); 3) From third marriage (with Tarita Teriipia) = Simon Teihotu Brando (b. 1967), Stefano Brando (b. 1967) and Tarita Cheyenne Brando (b. 1970 and d. 1995); 4) From liaisons with Maria Christina Ruiz, his maid = Ninna Priscilla Brando (b. 1989), Myles Jonathan Brando (b. 1992) and Timothy Gahan Brando (b. 1994). Also adopted three children: Petra Brando-Corval (daughter of Brando\'s assistant, Caroline Barrett), Maimiti Brando and Raiatua Brando.      His character Ken Wilcheck in his cinema debut The Men (1950) has the nickname ""Bud"", which was his own nickname as he was a ""junior"". (Brando\'s father, Marlon Brando Sr., later worked for his company Pennebaker Productions, which was named after his mother, the former Dorothy Pennebaker.) The only other film in which Brando goes by the name which his family and intimate friends called him is The Night of the Following Day (1969).      After he received his first Academy Award nomination (Best Actor for A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)), Brando impishly told the Hollywood press corps that he would not attend the ceremony but would send a cab driver in his place to pick up the Oscar, should he win the award. Indeed, Brando did not attend, and some columnists claimed that a cabby actually was in attendance in Brando\'s seat at Los Angeles\' RKO Pantages Theatre the night of ceremony of March 20, 1952. Alas, Brando was the sole ""Steetcar"" acting nominee not to win that night as Humphrey Bogart took home the gold, so the question can never be satisfactorily resolved.Jay Kantor was a lowly mailroom clerk at Lew Wasserman\'s talent agency Music Corp. of America when he was sent to pick up Brando and drive him to the agency. Impressed by the young man, Brando promptly appointed him his agent (Kantor was the inspiration for the character Teddy Z on the television series The Famous Teddy Z (1989)).Sean Penn told writer Charles Bukowski that Brando put scripts from producers into his freezer, in order to use them as targets in skeet shooting. Brando would take the frozen scripts and have them tossed in the air into the canyon below his home at night, and then proceed to blast them into smithereens with a shotgun while they were on the fly. By freezing the scripts, the pages were stiff and made for better ""clay pigeon"" substitutes. The practice is mentioned in one of Bukowski\'s poems. Bukowski also wrote about Brando in his short story ""You Kissed Lilly"", in which Lilly masturbates while watching Brando in a movie on television. The story is part of the collection ""Hot Water Music"" (1983).      Turned down the role of Vulcan in The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988). Director Terry Gilliam was summoned to Brando\'s Mulholland Dr. home in Los Angeles to discuss the role, but this became apparent that Brando really was not interested in taking the role. Nonetheless, Gilliam treasured the time he got to spend with Brando. The role later was played by Oliver Reed, who spent his time drinking and trying to seduce Uma Thurman, who was a virgin at the time.      Was Oliver Stone\'s first choice for the role of Richard Boyle in Salvador (1986). However, Brando had become notoriously reclusive by the time the project got underway and turned down the role.      He was an avid user of the Internet in his final years, often going into chat rooms to start arguments.      Subject of the song ""I\'m Stuck in a Condo with Mr. Marlon Brando"" by The Dickies.      Grandfather of Tuki Brando, son of Brando\'s daughter Cheyenne, the three children of Teihotu Brando, Michael Brando son of Christian Brando, the children of Michael G. Gilman and Shane Brando and Prudence Brando, from Miko C. Brando, among others.      Originally considered too young at 23 to play Stanley Kowalski in the Broadway version of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", and the producers of the show tried to get 34-year-old Burt Lancaster, newly a huge star in movies thanks to The Killers (1946). When Lancaster was unable to get permission from the film studio, Brando was given the part and became an overnight sensation.      Turned down Edmund Purdom\'s role in The Egyptian (1954).      Turned down Gary Cooper\'s Oscar winning role in High Noon (1952).      Turned down Charlton Heston\'s Oscar winning role in Ben-Hur (1959).      He was originally cast in John Wayne\'s role as Genghis Khan in The Conqueror (1956), but backed out at the last minute.      A large part of his estate was bought by entrepreneur Keya Morgan.      Brando was sought for the role of Bull McCabe in The Field (1990), but Richard Harris was cast instead.      Is related to four presidents of the United States: James Madison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, Jimmy Carter; and to General George S. Patton.      He was sought for the role of O\'Brien the interrogator in Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984), along with Sean Connery and Paul Scofield. Scofield accepted the role, but had to drop out of shooting after breaking his arm and was replaced by Richard Burton.      Turned down Stacy Keach\'s role in American History X (1998).      The American Film Institute named him the fourth Greatest Male Star of All Time (1999).      His Mulholland Drive home once shared a driveway with his The Missouri Breaks (1976) co-star Jack Nicholson. Nicholson later bought Brando\'s home from his estate.      Brando\'s first Oscar nomination for A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) marked his first of four consecutive nominations, a feat he shares with Jennifer Jones (1943-1946), Thelma Ritter (1950-1953), Elizabeth Taylor (1957-1960) and Al Pacino (1972-1975).      His favorite comedians were Charles Chaplin, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, W.C. Fields, Wally Cox, Woody Allen and Don Rickles. However, he did consider The Marx Brothers ""embarassing"".      Former brother-in-law of Eliot Asinof.      Encouraged Johnny Depp to get himself a private island just like his one in Tahiti.      In the summer of 1995, he started shooting a movie called ""Divine Rapture"" in the tiny Irish village of Ballycotton, County Cork. His co-stars were Johnny Depp, Debra Winger and John Hurt. Marlon was playing a priest in the film and he had dyed his hair red for the role. Shooting began, but was never completed due to lack of financing.      Biography in: ""The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives"". Volume 7, 2003-2005, pages 43-46. Farmington Hills, MI: Thomson Gale, 2007.      His favorite movie was Henry V (1989) which starred and was directed by Kenneth Branagh.      Spoke French fluently, from his marriage to his Mutiny on the Bounty (1962) co-star Tarita.      In a 1989 TV interview with Connie Chung, Brando told her that he contributed his entire salary for A Dry White Season (1989) to an anti-apartheid group in South Africa with the understanding that MGM would make a similar contribution. The movie was the first Brando had made in nine years. Brando quoted his salary at $3.3 million plus 11.3% of gross. He claimed that MGM reneged on its own matching contribution to the group and that he was uncertain how much the group received from MGM because of his percentage. Brando\'s anger with MGM over reneging on its charitable contribution and for cutting his scenes (which he felt were a more forceful indictment of apartheid and had been done to prevent South Africa\'s then-apartheid government from banning the studio\'s films) was felt to be one of the reasons that Brando gave his first interview in many years.      His idols are Fredric March, John Barrymore and Spencer Tracy.      While making Mutiny on the Bounty (1962) in Tahiti, Brando fell in love with the place. So in 1966, he purchased Tetiaroa, a small atoll located approximately 30 miles north of Tahiti. Tetiaroa is to be the site of a lavish new ecological hotel called The Brando. Consisting of 30 deluxe fares (villas), it will be the only hotel on Tetiaroa.      In the last three years of his life, Marlon filmed a series of classes of him giving acting lessons to Sean Penn, Jon Voight and Nick Nolte. Marlon intended to call the series ""Lying for a Living"" and to sell DVDs of it on shopping channel QVC to raise money. The DVDs were never released publicly following his death.      His ashes were scattered in Tahiti and Death Valley.      He died in 2004 at age 80, from obesity, pulmonary fibrosis, diabetes, cardiac failure, and an enlarged liver suggesting cancer.      Finished first in MSN\'s ""The Big 50: Cinema\'s Greatest Legends"" poll in March 2009 (Robert De Niro finished runner-up with Al Pacino in third place).      He allegedly refused to be interviewed for Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker\'s Apocalypse (1991) (a documentary about the making of Apocalypse Now (1979)) because he claimed Francis Ford Coppola still owed him $2 million.      His Sacheen Littlefeather controversy at the Oscars resulted in the Academy setting stricter rules that nominees cannot send someone else to accept the award onstage or address the audience, and only the presenter is allowed to accept on the winner\'s behalf. Exceptions are made in the case that the honoree genuinely could not attend due to illness or death.      One of only four actors to win two Oscars for films that also won Best Picture (the others being Jack Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman). In addition, he and Hoffman are the only actors to win two Best Actor Oscars for films that won Best Picture.      Was a huge fan of professional wrestling.      Producer Robert Evans said that Brando was signed for the role of Don Corleone in The Godfather (1972) for $50,000 plus a percentage of the gross on a sliding scale: after the film hit a $10 million threshold, Brando would receive 1% of the gross for the next $10 million and an additional 1% for every $10 million up to 5% when the film grossed over $60 million. (Thus, Brando would receive $100,000 for the second $10 million; $200,000 for the third $10 million; $300,000 for the fourth $10 million; $400,000 for the fifth $10 million; and 5% of everything above that. In desperate need of cash, Brando\'s attorney called Evans and requested a $100,000 advance. Charlie Bluhdorn, who owned Paramount, demanded that he surrender his points for the cash, and Brando did. Upon its release, ""The Godfather"" became the top-grossing film of all time. Evans estimated that Brando lost $11 million by selling back his points. Brando was so angry, he refused to appear in The Godfather: Part II (1974) unless he was compensated for his bad deal. Paramount refused. When the studio considered him for the lead in The Great Gatsby (1974), he pushed aside his agent and demanded an unprecedented $4 million fee, seeking to make up for his lost money. Paramount cast Robert Redford instead.      Brando was a great fan of French actress Arletty, who had played Blanche Dubois on the Paris stage and was in a film he greatly admired, Les enfants du paradis (1945). When he went to Paris, he made it a point to meet her but was disappointed, calling her a ""real tough bird"".      Acquired the nickname of \'Bud\' to distinguish himself from his father whom he disliked.      His mother co-starred with a young Henry Fonda in Eugene O\'Neill\'s ""Beyond the Horizon"" at the Omaha Community Playhouse.      When asked to contribute to his biography for the theater program of ""I Remember Mama"", Brando claimed he was born in Calcutta and had a Great Dane whom he feeds ""dehydrated cubes of dog food"".      While he was at the Actors Studio, Brando directed Julie Harris in a modern version of ""Hedda Gabler"" set in Nebraska.      When shooting The Men (1950), Brando stayed in the one bedroom apartment of actor Richard Erdman. Brando slept on the couch and was a voracious eater. Brando, who was being paid $40,000 for his role, never offered to help with expenses or restock the refrigerator for Erdman, who was being paid only $5000.      Brando agreed to appear in Candy (1968) as a favour to friend Christian Marquand, who helped with Brando\'s negotiations with the French government in purchasing the Tahitian island of Tetiaroa.      Brando donated his $25,000 salary for his one day of work on Roots: The Next Generations (1979) to the American Indian Movement.      Brando enjoyed talking to strangers on other islands or passing boats on his ham radio anonymously. He did not used his real name, and often called himself ""Mike"" or ""Matin Bumby"" and spoke in very believable French, German and Japanese accents.      Between 1981 and 1983, Brando received multimillion offers to play Al Capone, Pablo Picasso and Karl Marx but turned them down.      Playing the role of Stanley Kowalski, Brando had to describe the Napoleonic Code. Later in his career, he would play the role of Napoleon in D\xe9sir\xe9e (1954).      He appeared with Glenn Ford in The Teahouse of the August Moon (1956) and Superman (1978) while his elder sister Jocelyn Brando worked with him in The Big Heat (1953).      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1765 Vine Street in Hollywood, California on February 8, 1960.      Had appeared in two Best Picture Academy Award winners: On the Waterfront (1954) and The Godfather (1972).      Although he played John Cazale, James Caan and Al Pacino\'s father in The Godfather (1972), he was only eleven years older than Cazale and sixteen years older than Caan and Pacino in real life.      He won his first Oscar for On the Waterfront (1954) on March 20, 1955, four days before he turned age 31, making him the youngest Best Actor winner. He held the record for 23 years.      In late 1959, this was suggested that he might play William the Conqueror in an epic film which would be the first Cinerama movie to tell a dramatic story instead of being simply a travelogue. Reports suggested that Maria Schell might be his leading lady, that Christopher Fry might write the script and that Laurence Olivier might direct. However, the film was never made, and it seems likely that none of these celebrities was actually made any firm offer. This was several years more before the first narrative films in Cinerama.      Was one of the many Hollywood celebrities who like to make weekend visit\'s to Ralph Helfer\'s ""Africa U.S.A"" Exotic Animal Ranch in Soledad Canyon, California.      In the early 1960s, he contributed thousands of dollars to both the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCIC) and to a scholarship fund established for the children of martyred Mississippi NAACP field secretary Medgar Evers.      Had to lose weight in order to play Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather (1972).      Got his role as Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now (1979) after Al Pacino turned down.      Wore lifts in some of his films.      About a year into the run of A Streetcar Named Desire on the New York stage he was fooling around with some of the guys backstage and ended up with a broken nose.      Soon after his birth the family moved to Libertyville, Illinois where he was raised.      He is one of many personalities mentioned in the song ""Jesus Numa Moto"" by S\xe1 e Guarabyra.      In his youth, he praised Fredric March as his favorite actor.      During his emotional performance in ""The Men"", he brought co-star Teresa Wright to tears.Personal Quotes (126)      The more sensitive you are, the more likely you are to be brutalised, develop scabs and never evolve. Never allow yourself to feel anything because you always feel too much.      The only thing an actor owes his public is not to bore them.      An actor is at most a poet and at least an entertainer.      Would people applaud me if I were a good plumber?      I don\'t know what people expect when they meet me. They seem to be afraid that I\'m going to piss in the potted palm and slap them on the ass.      I put on an act sometimes, and people think I\'m insensitive. Really, it\'s like a kind of armour because I\'m too sensitive. If there are two hundred people in a room and one of them doesn\'t like me, I\'ve got to get out.      If you\'re successful, acting is about as soft a job as anybody could ever wish for. But if you\'re unsuccessful, it\'s worse than having a skin disease.      [on one of his most famous characters, Stanley Kowalski from A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)] Kowalski was always right, and never afraid. He never wondered, he never doubted. His ego was very secure. And he had the kind of brutal aggressiveness that I hate. I\'m afraid of it. I detest the character.      I don\'t want to spread the peanut butter of my personality on the mouldy bread of the commercial press.      The most repulsive thing you could ever imagine is the inside of a camel\'s mouth. That and watching a girl eat octopus or squid.      With women, I\'ve got a long bamboo pole with a leather loop on the end. I slip the loop around their necks so they can\'t get away or come too close. Like catching snakes.      If there\'s anything unsettling to the stomach, it\'s watching actors on television talk about their personal lives.      [on Frank Sinatra] He\'s the kind of guy that when he dies, he\'s going up to heaven and give God a bad time for making him bald.      [on his unforgettable role as Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather (1972)] I went home and did some rehearsing to satisfy my curiosity about whether I could play an Italian. I put on some makeup, stuffed Kleenex in my cheeks and worked out the characterization first in front of a mirror, then on a television monitor. After working on it, I decided I could create a characterization that would support the story. The people at Paramount saw the footage and liked it, and that\'s how I became the Godfather.      [when asked how he spent his time away from the camera] People ask that a lot. They say, ""What did you do while you took time out?"", as if the rest of my life is taking time out. But the fact is, making movies is time out for me because the rest, the nearly complete whole, is what\'s real for me. I\'m not an actor and haven\'t been for years. I\'m a human being - hopefully a concerned and somewhat intelligent one - who occasionally acts.      Regret is useless in life. It\'s in the past. All we have is now.      Acting is the expression of a neurotic impulse. It\'s a bum\'s life. Quitting acting is a sign of maturity.      [on the impact of The Godfather (1972)] I\'d gotten to know quite a few mafiosi, and all of them told me they loved the picture because I had played the Godfather with dignity. Even today I can\'t pay a check in Little Italy.      Acting is an empty and useless profession.      [on his characterization of Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront (1954)] [The role] was actor-proof, a scene that demonstrated how audiences often do much of the acting themselves in an effectively told story.      [on directing] I did it once. It was an ass-breaker. You work yourself to death. You\'re the first one up in the morning... I mean, we shot that thing [One-Eyed Jacks (1961)] on the run, you know. You make up the dialog the scene before, improvising, and your brain is going crazy.      [on the Academy Awards, to Connie Chung after his Best Supporting Actor nomination for A Dry White Season (1989)] That\'s a part of the sickness in America, that you have to think in terms of who wins, who loses, who\'s good, who\'s bad, who\'s best, who\'s worst... I don\'t like to think that way. Everybody has their own value in different ways, and I don\'t like to think who\'s the best at this. I mean, what\'s the point of it?      [on the Academy Awards, Connie Chung TV interview, 1990] What do I care? I\'ve made all the money I need to make. I won a couple of Academy Awards if I ever cared about that. I\'ve been nominated I don\'t know how many times and I\'m in a position of respect and standing in my craft as an actor in this country. So what the hell, I don\'t need to gild the lily.      [after accepting the Best Actor Oscar for On the Waterfront (1954) at the 27th Academy Awards ceremony] I can\'t remember what I was going to say for the life of me. I don\'t think ever in my life that so many people were so directly responsible for my being so very, very happy.      If the vacuum formed by Dr. [Martin Luther King\'s] death isn\'t filled with concern and understanding and a measure of love, then I think we all are really going to be lost here in this country.      [on Malcolm X] He was a dynamic person, a very special human being who might have caused a revolution. He had to be done away with. The American government couldn\'t let him live. If 23 million blacks found a charismatic leader like he was, they would have followed him. The powers that be couldn\'t accept that.      It is a simple fact that all of us use the techniques of acting to achieve whatever ends we seek... Acting serves as the quintessential social lubricant and a device for protecting our interests and gaining advantage in every aspect of life.      It seems to me hilarious that our government put the face of Elvis Presley on a postage stamp after he died from an overdose of drugs. His fans don\'t mention that because they don\'t want to give up their myths. They ignore the fact that he was a drug addict and claim he invented rock \'n\' roll when in fact he took it from black culture; they had been singing that way for years before he came along, copied them and became a star.      I\'m one of those people who believes that if I\'m very good in this life I\'ll go to France when I die.      Even today, I meet people who think of me automatically as a tough, insensitive, coarse guy named Stanley Kowalski. They can\'t help it, but it is troubling.      A movie that I was in, called On the Waterfront (1954): there was a scene in a taxicab, where I turn to my brother, who\'s come to turn me over to the gangsters, and I lament to him that he never looked after me, he never gave me a chance, that I could have been a contender, I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum... ""You should of looked out after me, Charley."" It was very moving. And people often spoke about that, ""Oh, my God, what a wonderful scene, Marlon, blah blah blah blah blah."" It wasn\'t wonderful at all. The situation was wonderful. Everybody feels like he could have been a contender, he could have been somebody, everybody feels as though he\'s partly bum, some part of him. He is not fulfilled and he could have done better, he could have been better. Everybody feels a sense of loss about something. So that was what touched people. It wasn\'t the scene itself. There are other scenes where you\'ll find actors being expert, but since the audience can\'t clearly identify with them, they just pass unnoticed. Wonderful scenes never get mentioned, only those scenes that affect people.      Most people want those fantasies of those who are worthy of our hate - we get rid of a lot of anger that way; and of those who are worthy of our idolatry. Whether it\'s Farrah Fawcett or somebody else, it doesn\'t make a difference. They\'re easily replaceable units, pick \'em out like a card file. Johnnie Ray enjoyed that kind of hysterical popularity, celebration, and then suddenly he wasn\'t there anymore. The Beatles are now nobody in particular. Once they set screaming crowds running after them, they ran in fear of their lives, they had special tunnels for them. They can walk almost anyplace now. Because the fantasy is gone. Elvis Presley - bloated, over the hill, adolescent entertainer, suddenly drawing people into Las Vegas - had nothing to do with excellence, just myth. It\'s convenient for people to believe that something is wonderful, therefore they\'re wonderful.      If Wally [Wally Cox] had been a woman, I would have married him and we would have lived happily ever after.      America has been good to me, but that wasn\'t a gift.      I have eyes like those of a dead pig.      The only reason I\'m in Hollywood is that I don\'t have the moral courage to refuse the money.      Privacy is not something that I\'m merely entitled to, it\'s an absolute prerequisite.      I don\'t mind that I\'m fat. You still get the same money.      This is a false world. It\'s been a struggle to try to preserve my sanity and sense of reality taken away by success. I have to fight hard to preserve that sense of reality so as to bring up my children.      I always enjoyed watching John Wayne, but it never occurred to me until I spoke with Indians how corrosive and damaging and destructive his movies were - most Hollywood movies were.      [on John Wayne\'s 1971 interview with Playboy magazine] That doesn\'t need a reply, it\'s self-evident. You can\'t even get mad at it; it\'s so insane that there\'s just nothing to say about it. He would be, according to his point of view, someone not disposed to returning any of the colonial possessions in Africa or Asia to their rightful owners. He would be sharing a perspective with B.J. Vorster if he were in South Africa. He would be on the side of Ian Smith. He would have shot down Gandhi [Mohandas K. Gandhi], called him a rabble rouser. The only freedom fighters he would recognize would be those who were fighting Communists; if they were fighting to get out from under colonial rule, he\'d call them terrorists. The Indians today he\'d call agitators, terrorists, who knows? If John Wayne ran for President, he would get a great following... I think he\'s been enormously instrumental in perpetuating this view of the Indian as a savage, ferocious, destructive force. He\'s made us believe things about the Indian that were never true and perpetuated the myth about how wonderful the frontiersmen were and how decent and honorable we all were.      Everybody ought not to turn his back on the phenomenon of hatred in whatever form it takes. We have to find out what the anatomy of hatred is before we can understand it. We have to make some attempt to put it into some understandable form. Any kind of group hatred is extremely dangerous and much more volatile than individual hatred. Heinous crimes are committed by groups and it\'s all done, of course, in the name of right, justice. It\'s John Wayne. It\'s the way he thinks. All the crimes committed against Indians are not considered crimes by John Wayne.      I don\'t see anybody as evil. When you start seeing people as evil, you\'re in trouble. The thing that\'s going to save us is understanding. The inspection of the mind of Eichmann [Adolf Eichmann] or Himmler [Heinrich Himmler]... Just to dispense with them as evil is not enough, because it doesn\'t bring you understanding. You have to see them for what they are. You have to examine John Wayne. He\'s not a bad person. Who among us is going to say he\'s a bad man? He feels justified for what he does. The damage that he does he doesn\'t consider damage, he thinks it\'s an honest presentation of the facts.      Three or four times, I\'ve pulled a gun on somebody. I had a problem after Charles Manson, deciding to get a gun. But I didn\'t want somebody coming in my house and committing mayhem. The Hillside Strangler victims - one of the girls was found in back of my Los Angeles house. My next-door neighbor was murdered, strangled in the bathroom. Mulholland Drive is full of crazy people. We have nuts coming up and down all the time.      [1976] Homosexuality is so much in fashion it no longer makes news. Like a large number of men, I, too, have had homosexual experiences and I am not ashamed. I have never paid much attention to what people think about me. But if there is someone who is convinced that Jack Nicholson and I are lovers, may they continue to do so. I find it amusing.      I know I\'m not an easy person to get along with, I\'m no walk in the park.      [on Burt Reynolds] I disagree with the thought process of people like him, who is a totally narcissistic person who epitomizes everything wrong with being a celebrity in Hollywood.      [on Cheyenne Autumn (1964)] That was worse than any other film, because it didn\'t tell the truth. Superduper patriots like John Ford could never say that the American government was at fault. He made the evil cavalry captain a foreigner. John Ford had him speak with a thick accent, you didn\'t know what he was, but you knew he didn\'t represent Mom\'s apple pie.      You\'re not going to call The Rolling Stones artists. I heard somebody compare them - or The Beatles - to Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach]. It was claimed they had created something as memorable and as important as Bach, Haydn [Joseph Haydn], Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart] and Schubert [Franz Schubert]. I hate rock \'n\' roll. It\'s ugly. I liked it when the blacks had it in 1927.      Never confuse the size of your paycheck with the size of your talent.Humphrey Bogart played himself in every movie. Clark Gable always played Clark Gable.      Regrets belong to the past.      [on Hollywood] A cultural boneyard.      [on Dustin Hoffman] I believe that he has talent. He ought to get away from this rather nervous character that he\'s played since Midnight Cowboy (1969). Then we\'d really be able to see that he\'s a complete actor.      The good directors that I\'ve worked with will say I\'m a good guy. The other fellows will say I\'m a bad guy.      [on Marilyn Monroe] Marilyn was a sensitive, misunderstood person, much more perceptive than was generally assumed. She had been beaten down, but had a strong emotional intelligence -- a keen intuition for the feelings of others, the most refined type of intelligence. We had an affair and saw each other intermittently until she died in 1962. It\'s been speculated that she had a secret rendezvous with [Robert F. Kennedy] that week and was distraught because he wanted to end an affair between them. But she didn\'t seem depressed to me, and I don\'t think that if she was sleeping with him at the time she would have invited me over for dinner. I\'m sure she didn\'t commit suicide. I have always believed that she was murdered.      At Paramount, I sat at lunch with John Wayne. I couldn\'t even talk.      Do you remember when Marilyn Monroe died? Everybody stopped work, and you could see all that day the same expressions on their faces, the same thought: ""How can a girl with success, fame, youth, money, beauty... how could she kill herself?"" Nobody could understand it because those are the things that everybody wants, and they can\'t believe that life wasn\'t important to Marilyn Monroe, or that her life was elsewhere.      Most New York and Beverly Hills psychoanalysts are a little crazy themselves, as well as highly motivated to separate patients from their money while making their emotional problems worse.      [on Lee Strasberg] An ambitious, selfish man who exploited the people who attended the Actors Studio, and he tried to project himself as an acting oracle and guru. Some people worshipped him, but I never knew why.      I bumped into Marilyn Monroe at a party. While other people drank and danced, she sat by herself in a corner almost unnoticed, playing the piano.      I come from a long line of Irish drunks.      If given the choice between Kenneth Branagh\'s production of Henry V (1989) or Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s The Terminator (1984), there\'s hardly a question of where most television dials would be turned. If the expenditure of money for entertainment in America is any indication of taste, clearly the majority of us are addicted to trash.      When I saw The Godfather (1972) the first time, it made me sick; all I could see were my mistakes and I hated it. But years later, when I saw it on television from a different perspective, I decided it was a pretty good film.      [on Al Pacino] I didn\'t say much to Pacino when we were making The Godfather (1972), but I not only consider him one of the best actors in America, but in the world. I never meant anything more in my life.      I had a great deal of respect for Don Corleone; I saw him as a man of substance, tradition, dignity, refinement, a man of unerring instinct who just happened to live in a violent world and who had to protect himself and his family in this environment. I saw him as a decent person regardless of what he had to do, as a man who believed in family values and was shaped by events just like the rest of us.      On The Godfather (1972), I had signs and cue cards everywhere -- on my shirt sleeves, on a watermelon and glued to the scenery. Not memorizing lines increased the illusion of reality and spontaneity.      News is business. And, uh, people sell news, and unfortunately people in my position are in the public eye, are sellable commodities, but they\'re not any different than Kleenex or Dial Soap or anything else. And uh, so if we find something out that\'s about your sex life, or something you do with your fingernails after you cut them off, if you smoke the grime from your navel, then... then... that\'s big news. That\'s important... But anyway, it doesn\'t matter. Because, finally, you know... I\'ve found that people really don\'t believe all the nonsense they read. And they look at you when they meet you, and wonder if it\'s true, but they finally make a decision based on what their experience with you personally is.      A lot of the old movie stars couldn\'t act their way out of a box of wet tissue paper, but they were successful because they had distinctive personalities. They were predictable brands of breakfast cereal: on Wednesdays we had Quaker Oats and Gary Cooper; on Fridays we had Wheaties and Clark Gable. They were off-the-shelf products you expected always to be the same, actors and actresses with likable personalities who played themselves more or less the same role the same way every time out.      Everyone on a movie deserves an award - not just one person.      I know it can be hard for a troubled kid like James Dean to have to live up to sudden fame and the ballyhoo Hollywood created around him. I saw it happen to Marilyn Monroe and I also knew it from my own experience. In trying to copy me, I think Jimmy was only attempting to deal with these insecurities, but I told him it was a mistake.      Acting is an illusion, a form of histrionic slight of hand, and in order to carry it off, an actor must have intense concentration. Before I go into a scene, I study it, almost psychoanalyze it. Then I discuss it with the director and then rehearse it. When actual shooting commences, I put in earplugs to screen out the extraneous noises that inevitably prick at one\'s concentration.      With so much prejudice, racial discrimination, injustice, hatred, poverty, starvation and suffering in the world, making movies seemed increasingly silly and irrelevant.      Food has always been my friend. When I wanted to feel better or had a crisis in my life, I opened the icebox.      I hated authority and did everything I could to defeat it by resisting it, subverting it, tricking it and outmaneuvering it. I would do anything to avoid being treated like a cipher.      If I hadn\'t been an actor, I\'ve often thought I\'d have become a con man and wound up in jail.      An actor\'s a guy who, if you ain\'t talking about him, ain\'t listening.      I\'m just another son-of-a-bitch sitting in a motor home on a film set and they come looking for Zeus.      [on his regret at not appearing in the movie version of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958)] I know more about being a homosexual than Paul Newman. It\'s very clear to me that Tennessee Williams modeled Alexandra Del Lago after Tallulah Bankhead. I surely know how to appear opposite a Tallulah character better than Newman.      [on working with David Niven on Bedtime Story (1964)] Working with David was the only time I ever looked forward to filming. I just couldn\'t wait to wake up each morning and go to work so he could make me laugh.      I\'m often amused when I read American history and I read what great things America was going to be, what great things we were going to produce, the magnificent life we were going to have. We were determined to be an impressive and strong nation that needed a lot of people and a lot of land. And all those people who came: ""Give us your great unwashed."" Well, we got all the great unwashed there were. From every prison we certainly got a lot of scum and dummies. We didn\'t get the cream of the crop. We got people from the lowest echelons of society who couldn\'t make it or weren\'t happy where they were. Or who were taken from Africa, brought to America in chains and turned into animals.      I think Robert F. Kennedy really, finally, cared; he realized that all of the rhetoric had to be put down into some form of action. That\'s perhaps the reason they killed him. They don\'t care what you say, you can say as much as you want to, provided you don\'t do anything. If you start to do something and your shuffling raises too much dust, they will disestablish you. That\'s what happened to Martin Luther King.      If you have enough money, you can do anything. You can even get a President shot. All you have to do is hire Sam Giancana, Sirhan Sirhan. You can get anybody killed for a can of beer. Hire some dumbo hit man, pay him $50,000. You can hire a 17-year-old kid, he\'ll be out in the streets in two or three years.The Godfather (1972) said that a man with a briefcase can steal more money than a man with a pistol.      Mothers feel about their children the way husbands feel about women. It\'s \'my\' kid. Women who are in the women\'s movement, some of them say they are not their husband\'s possession, but then they\'ll unconsciously refer to their child as a possession. They use the same kind of language about their children as they would hate for their husbands to use about them.      I don\'t know Woody Allen, but I like him very much. I saw Annie Hall (1977) -- enjoyed it enormously, He\'s an important man. Woody Allen can\'t make any sense out of this world and he really tells wonderful jokes about it. Don\'t you think it was remarkable that his time came to get his door prize at the Academy Awards and he stayed home and played his clarinet? That was as witty and funny a thing as you could do.Bob Hope will go to the opening of a phone booth in a gas station in Anaheim, provided they have a camera and three people there. He\'ll go to the opening of a market and receive an award. Get an award from Thom McAn for wearing their shoes. It\'s pathetic. It\'s a bottomless pit. A barrel that has no floor. He must be a man who has an ever-crumbling estimation of himself. He\'s constantly filling himself up. He\'s like a junkie -- an applause junkie, like Sammy Davis Jr.. Sammy desperately longs to be loved, approved of. He\'s very talented.      [on Lily Tomlin] Good God, is she angry. Whew! She gives me the impression of somebody incandescent with rage that comes out in this crinkle-eyed smiling face. Acid. She\'s funny, but all of her humor comes from anguish, rage and pain. Don Rickles, too. Most humor does.      I liked High Anxiety (1977). Mel Brooks makes me laugh. They had a Laurel and Hardy festival on television; boy, I laughed at that. It went on all night long; I was up half the night laughing.      [on Charles Chaplin] A remarkable talent but a monster of a man.      If an actor can\'t improvise, then perhaps the producer\'s wife cast him in that part. You wouldn\'t be in the film with such a person. Some actors don\'t like it. Laurence Olivier doesn\'t like to improvise; everything is structured and his roles are all according to an almost architectural plan.      [on Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972)] I don\'t know what that film\'s about. So much of it was improvised. [Bernardo Bertolucci] wanted to do this, to do that. I\'d seen his other movie, Il conformista (1970), and I thought he was a man of special talent. And he thought of all kinds of improvisations. He let me do anything. He told me the general area of what he wanted and I tried to produce the words or the action.      [on the taxi cab scene in On the Waterfront (1954)] People often spoke about that, ""Oh, my God, what a wonderful scene, Marlon, blah blah blah blah blah."" It wasn\'t wonderful at all. The situation was wonderful. Everybody feels like he could have been a contender, he could have been somebody, everybody feels as though he\'s partly bum, some part of him. He is not fulfilled and he could have done better, he could have been better. Everybody feels a sense of loss about something. So that was what touched people. It wasn\'t the scene itself.      [on acting] I don\'t put it down. But I resent people putting it up.      [on claims he defamed Italian-Americans with his portrayal of The Godfather (1972)] I played an Irishman who was a freak psychopath (in The Nightcomers (1971)) and I didn\'t get any letters from any Irish-American organizations. It would have been difficult to make The Godfather (1972) with an eighth Chinese, a quarter Russian, a quarter Irish and an eighth Hispanic. Very difficult to take those people to Sicily and call them O\'Houlihan.      We\'ve somehow substituted craft for art and cleverness for craft. It\'s revolting! It\'s disgusting that people talk about art and they haven\'t got the right to use the word. It doesn\'t belong on anybody\'s tongue in this century. There are no artists. We are businessmen. We\'re merchants. There is no art. Pablo Picasso was the last one I would call an artist.      Mao Tse-tung was the last giant.      I don\'t think any movie is a work of art.      A prostitute can give you all kinds of wonderful excitement and inspiration and make you think that nirvana has arrived on the two-o\'clock plane, and it ain\'t necessarily so.      Acting is just hustling.George Bernard Shaw said that thinking was the greatest of all human endeavors, but I would say that feeling was. Allowing yourself to feel things, to feel love or wrath, hatred, rage.      People will like you who never met you, they think you\'re absolutely wonderful; and then people also will hate you, for reasons that have nothing to do with any real experience with you. People don\'t want to lose their enemies. We have favorite enemies, people we love to hate and we hate to love. If they do something good, we don\'t like it. I found myself doing that with Ronald Reagan. He is anathema to me. If he does something that\'s reasonable, I find my mind trying to find some way to interpret it so that it\'s not reasonable, so that somewhere it\'s jingoist extremism.      If you\'ve made a hit movie, then you get the full 32-teeth display in some places; and if you\'ve sort of faded, they say, ""Are you still making movies? I remember that picture, blah blah blah."" And so it goes. The point of all this is, people are interested in people who are successful.      What people are willing to do in front of a public is puzzling. I don\'t understand why they do it. I guess it makes them feel a little less lonely. I always found it distasteful and not something I cared to do.      I just don\'t believe in washing my dirty underwear for all to see, and I\'m not interested in the confessions of movie stars.      [on his refusal to talk about Marilyn Monroe\'s death] It\'s disemboweling a ghost.      Ask most kids about details about Auschwitz or about how the American Indians were assassinated as a people and they don\'t know anything about it. They don\'t want to know anything. Most people just want their beer or their soap opera or their lullaby.      I\'m not going to lay myself at the feet of the American public and invite them into my soul. My soul is a private place. And I have some resentment of the fact that I live in a system where you have to do that.      You can say something in a certain spirit, with a smile, but when it appears in print, there\'s no smile.      [on American Indians] When they laid down their arms, we murdered them. We lied to them. We cheated them out of their lands. We starved them into signing fraudulent agreements that we called treaties which we never kept. We turned them into beggars on a continent that gave life for as long as life can remember. And by any interpretation of history, however twisted, we did not do right. We were not lawful nor were we just in what we did. For them, we do not have to restore these people, we do not have to live up to some agreements, because it is given to us by virtue of our power to attack the rights of others, to take their property, to take their lives when they are trying to defend their land and liberty, and to make their virtues a crime and our own vices virtues.      [on Charles Chaplin] Chaplin you got to go with. Chaplin is a man whose talents is such that you have to gamble. First off, comedy is his backyard. He\'s a genius, a cinematic genius. A comedic talent without peer.      [To his cast on the set of One-Eyed Jacks (1961)] I don\'t know how this film is going to end. But I want a scene where someone gets shot in the back. Who wants to be the shooter? Who wants to be the shootee?      [To his cast and crew on the set of One-Eyed Jacks (1961)] I\'ve got to have clouds, not a clear sky, before we can go on shooting.      [on Hollywood] A small-minded little town in the middle of nowhere.      [observation, 1952] One more film and I will have my pile. My mother and father are taken care of. I have eight hundred head of cattle on my ranch in Nevada. This [Viva Zapata! (1952)] should soon bring me an income of $80,000 a year. That will be enough. Any acting I do will be on the stage.      I don\'t think it\'s the nature of any man to be monogamous. Men are propelled by genetically ordained impulses over which they have no control to distribute their seed.      [on Burt Reynolds] He\'s the epitome of everything that\'s disgusting about the thespian. He worships at the temple of his own narcissism.      If you want something from an audience, you give blood to their fantasies. It\'s the ultimate hustle.      I\'m not a film fanatic. If I never saw another movie in my life, it wouldn\'t bother me. Acting is what I do to make money, but it\'s certainly not my life-style. Compared to world affairs, to peace conferences, making a movie is absolutely nothing!      To grasp the full significance of life is the actor\'s duty, to interpret it is his problem, and to express it his dedication.      [on Leonardo DiCaprio] He looks like a girl.      [before directing One-Eyed Jacks (1961)] I want to make a frontal assault on the temple of clich\xe9s.      [after directing One-Eyed Jacks (1961)] I don\'t feel it\'s what I set out to do. In my film, everybody lied, even the girl. The only one who told the truth was the Karl Malden character. Paramount made him out to be the heavy, a liar. Now the characters in the film are black and white, not gray and human as I planned them.      I am myself, and if I have to hit my head against a brick wall to remain true to myself, I will do it.      [To Bernardo Bertolucci about his role in Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972)] Never again will I make a film like this one. For the first time, I have felt a violation of my innermost self. It should be the last time.      I too have had homosexual experiences, and I am not ashamed. I\'d never paid much attention to what people think about me. Deep down, I feel a bit ambiguous.Salary (27)The Men\xa0(1950)      $40,000       The Men\xa0(1950)      $50,000 (equivalent of $477,354 in 2012 dollars)      A Streetcar Named Desire\xa0(1951)      $75,000 (equivalent of $663,706 in 2012 dollars)      Viva Zapata!\xa0(1952)      $100,000 (equivalent of $868,245 in 2012 dollars)      On the Waterfront\xa0(1954)      $100,000 (equivalent of $855,334 in 2012 dollars)      Guys and Dolls\xa0(1955)      $200,000 (equivalent of $1,710,668 in 2012 dollars)      Sayonara\xa0(1957)      $300,000 (equivalent of $2,456,423 in 2012 dollars)      Mutiny on the Bounty\xa0(1962)      $1,250,000 (equivalent of $9,500,000 in 2012 dollars)      The Chase\xa0(1966)      $750,000 plus $130,000 fee to his production company Pennebaker (equivalent of $6,249,222 in 2012 dollars)      Reflections in a Golden Eye\xa0(1967)      $750,000 + 10% of the net profits (equivalent of $5,326,041 today)      Candy\xa0(1968)      $50,000 plus points      The Night of the Following Day\xa0(1969)      $50,000       Queimada\xa0(1969)      $750,000       The Nightcomers\xa0(1971)      $50,000       The Godfather\xa0(1972)      $50,000 plus percentage of gross on sliding scale; points sold back for $100,000 ($150,000 equivalent of to $865,000 in 2013 dollars)      Ultimo tango a Parigi\xa0(1972)      $250,000 + 10% of the profits (equivalent of $10,000,00 in 2012 dollars)0      The Missouri Breaks\xa0(1976)      $1,250,000 plus 11% of gross receipts over $8,850,000 (equivalent of $5,000,000 in 2012 dollars)      Superman\xa0(1978)      $3,000,000       Roots: The Next Generations\xa0(1979)      $25,000       Apocalypse Now\xa0(1979)      $3,500,000       Apocalypse Now\xa0(1979)      $2,000,000 plus additional percentage (equivalent of $6,338,429 in 2012 dollars)      The Formula\xa0(1980)      $2,700,000       A Dry White Season\xa0(1989)      $4,000       A Dry White Season\xa0(1989)      $3,300,000 plus 11.3% of gross with proviso M.G.M. would contribute his upfront payment plus a similar amount to an anti-apartheid group      Christopher Columbus: The Discovery\xa0(1992)      $5,000,000       The Score\xa0(2001)      $3,000,000       Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration\xa0(2001)      $1,000,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","[u'\nAl Pacino ', u'""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 192 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(5)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(99)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(75)\xa0|Salary\xa0(8)  Overview (4)Date of Birth25\xa0April1940,\xa0Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA Birth NameAlfredo James PacinoNicknameSonny    Height5\'\xa07""\xa0(1.7\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          One of the greatest actors in all of film history, Al Pacino established himself during one of film\'s greatest decades, the 1970s, and has become an enduring and iconic figure in the world of American movies.Alfredo James Pacino was born on April 25, 1940, in the Bronx, New York, to an Italian-American family. His parents, Rose (Gerardi) and Sal Pacino, divorced when he was young. His mother moved them into his grandparents\' house. Pacino found himself often repeating the plots and voices of characters he had seen in the movies, one of his favorite activities. Bored and unmotivated in school, the young Al Pacino found a haven in school plays, and his interest soon blossomed into a full-time career. Starting on the stage, he went through a lengthy period of depression and poverty, sometimes having to borrow bus fare to make it to auditions. He made it into the prestigious Actors Studio in 1966, studying under legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg, creator of the Method Approach that would become the trademark of many 1970s-era actors.After appearing in a string of plays in supporting roles, Pacino finally succeeded with ""The Indian Wants the Bronx"", winning an Obie Award for the 1966-67 season. That was followed by a Tony Award for ""Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?"". His first feature films made little departure from the gritty realistic stage performances that earned him respect: he played a drug addict in The Panic in Needle Park (1971) after his film debut in Me, Natalie (1969). What came next would change his life forever. The role of Michael Corleone in The Godfather (1972) was one of the most sought-after of the time: Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Ryan O\'Neal, Robert De Niro and a host of others either wanted it or were mentioned for it, but director Francis Ford Coppola had his heart set on the unknown Italian Pacino for the role, although pretty much everyone else--from the studio to the producers to some of the cast members--did not want him.Though Coppola won out through slick persuasion, Pacino was in constant fear of being fired during the hellish shoot. Much to his (and Coppola\'s) relief, the film was a monster hit that did wonders for everyone\'s career, including Pacino\'s, and earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. However, instead of taking on easier projects for the big money he could now command, Pacino threw his support behind what he considered tough but important films, such as the true-life crime drama Serpico (1973) and the tragic real-life bank robbery film Dog Day Afternoon (1975). He opened eyes around the film world for his brave choice of roles, and he was nominated three consecutive years for the ""Best Actor"" Academy Award. He faltered slightly with Bobby Deerfield (1977), but regained his stride with ...and justice for all. (1979), for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Unfortunately, this would signal the beginning of a decline in his career, which produced such critical and commercial flops as Cruising (1980) and Author! Author! (1982).Pacino took on another vicious gangster role and cemented his legendary status in the ultra-violent cult film Scarface (1983), but a monumental mistake was about to follow. Revolution (1985) endured an endless and seemingly cursed shoot in which equipment was destroyed, weather was terrible, and Pacino became terribly sick with pneumonia. Constant changes in the script also further derailed a project that seemed doomed from the start anyway. The Revolutionary War film is considered one of the worst films ever, not to mention one of the worst of his career, resulted in his first truly awful reviews and kept him off the screen for the next four years. Returning to the stage, Pacino has done much to give back and contribute to the theatre, which he considers his first love. He directed a film, The Local Stigmatic (1990), but it remains unreleased. He lifted his self-imposed exile with the striking Sea of Love (1989) as a hard-drinking policeman. This marked the second phase of Pacino\'s career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice.Returning to the Corleones, Pacino made The Godfather: Part III (1990) and earned raves for his first comedic role in the colorful adaptation Dick Tracy (1990). This earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and two years later he was nominated for Glengarry Glen Ross (1992). He went into romantic mode for Frankie and Johnny (1991). In 1992, he finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his amazing performance in Scent of a Woman (1992). A mixture of technical perfection (he plays a blind man) and charisma, the role was tailor-made for him, and remains a classic. The next few years would see Pacino becoming more comfortable with acting and movies as a business, turning out great roles in great films with more frequency and less of the demanding personal involvement of his wilder days. Carlito\'s Way (1993) proved another gangster classic, as did the epic crime drama Heat (1995) directed by Michael Mann and co-starring Robert De Niro, although they only had a few scenes together. He returned to the director\'s chair for the highly acclaimed and quirky Shakespeare adaptation Looking for Richard (1996). City Hall (1996), Donnie Brasco (1997) and The Devil\'s Advocate (1997) all came out in this period. Reteaming with Mann and then Oliver Stone, he gave two commanding performances in The Insider (1999) and Any Given Sunday (1999).In the 2000s, Pacino starred in a number of theatrical blockbusters, including Ocean\'s Thirteen (2007), but his choice in television roles (the vicious Roy Cohn in the HBO miniseries Angels in America (2003) and his sensitive portrayal of Jack Kevorkian, in the television movie You Don\'t Know Jack (2010)) are reminiscent of the bolder choices of his early career. Each television project garnered him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.In his personal life, Pacino is one of Hollywood\'s most enduring and notorious bachelors, having never been married. He has a daughter, Julie Marie, with acting teacher Jan Tarrant, and a new set of twins with longtime girlfriend Beverly D\'Angelo. His romantic history includes a long-time romance with ""Godfather"" co-star Diane Keaton. With his intense and gritty performances, Pacino was an original in the acting profession. His Method approach would become the process of many actors throughout time, and his unbeatable number of classic roles has already made him a legend among film buffs and all aspiring actors and directors. His commitment to acting as a profession and his constant screen dominance has established him as one of the movies\' true legends.Pacino has never abandoned his love for the theater, and Shakespeare in particular, having directed the Shakespeare adaptation Looking for Richard (1996) and played Shylock in The Merchant of Venice (2004).- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Pedro Borges          Trade Mark (5)        Volcanic tirade, smoke-burnished voice        Frequently plays men of power and/or authority        Surly but essentially moral characters with deep capacity for violence        Jet black hair and dark owl eyes        Diminutive frame, off-set by his formidable bearingTrivia (99)      Ranked #4 in Empire (UK) magazine\'s ""The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time"" list.

Imprinted his hands and signature in cement at Grauman\'s Chinese Theatre on November 16, 1997.      Stated in an interview that the movie he most wanted to be in but could not get the role was Slap Shot (1977).

At one point, David Cronenberg was in line to direct the film The Singing Detective (2003), with Pacino in the lead.      Over the ending credits of A Cock and Bull Story (2005) the two stars, Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon compete at doing Pacino impressions.      Oscar-winning director John Schlesinger envisioned a cast of Pacino, Julie Christie and Laurence Olivier for Marathon Man (1976). Pacino has said that the only actress he had ever wanted to work with was Christie, who he claimed was ""the most poetic of actresses"". Producer Robert Evans, who disparaged the vertically challenged Pacino as ""The Midget"" when Francis Ford Coppola wanted him for The Godfather (1972) and had thought of firing him during the early shooting of the now-classic film, vetoed Pacino for the lead. Instead, Evans insisted on the casting of the even shorter Dustin Hoffman! On her part, Christie -- who was notoriously finicky about accepting roles, even in prestigious, sure-fire material -- turned down the female lead, which was then taken by Marthe Keller (who, ironically, became Pacino\'s lover after co-starring with him in Bobby Deerfield (1977)). Of his dream cast, Schlesinger only got Olivier, who was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Pacino has yet to co-star with Christie.      Has suffered from chronic insomnia.      His Oscar nomination for The Godfather (1972) marked his first of four consecutive nominations, a feat he shares with Jennifer Jones (1943-1946), Thelma Ritter (1950-1953), Marlon Brando (1951-1954) and Elizabeth Taylor (1957-1960).      Has been friends with HRH Prince Charles, The Prince of Wales, for several years, and has stayed as his guest at Highgrove House.      He studied acting at HB Studio in Greenwich Village, New York City.      Former New York deputy mayor Ken Lipper was one of Pacino\'s classmates in school.      When asked by the AFI, he named L\'albero degli zoccoli (1978) and Singin\' in the Rain (1952) as his favorite films.      Got co-star Kevin Spacey his first major role in a film. Pacino saw Spacey performing on Broadway and suggested him to the director of Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) for the role of John Williamson.      Is a huge fan of Dick Van Dyke.      Lifetime member of the prestigious Actors Studio. He was accepted into the studio in 1966, studying under legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg.      The voice of Moe the Bartender from The Simpsons (1989) was based on Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon (1975).      Resides in Beverly Hills, California and Palisades, New York.      Spoke three of the American Film Institute\'s 100 Movie Quotes: ""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."" from The Godfather: Part II (1974) at #58, ""Say \'hello\' to my little friend!"" from Scarface (1983) at #61 and ""Attica!

Became a father for the second and third time at age 60 when his [now ex] partner Beverly D\'Angelo gave birth to their twins Anton and Olivia Pacino on January 25, 2001.      During the early 1980s, Pacino tried unsuccessfully to develop a biographical film on Amedeo Modigliani.      Claims to have learned more about acting from friend John Cazale than from anybody else.

Of those, The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather: Part II (1974) are winners in the category.      Has great respect for many of his peers including Robert De Niro, Johnny Depp and Sean Penn.      Although he played Morgana King and Marlon Brando\'s son in The Godfather (1972), he is only ten and sixteen years their junior respectively.      Along with Barry Fitzgerald and Sylvester Stallone, he is one of only three actors to receive Oscar nominations for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor for playing the same character: (1) Fitzgerald was nominated for both awards for playing Father Fitzgibbon in Going My Way (1944), (2) Pacino was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for playing Michael Corleone The Godfather (1972) and Best Actor for the same role in The Godfather: Part II (1974) and (3) Stallone was nominated for Best Actor for playing Rocky Balboa in Rocky (1976) and Best Supporting Actor for the same role in Creed (2015).      Has worked with seven directors who have won a Best Director Oscar: Francis Ford Coppola, Sydney Pollack, William Friedkin, Warren Beatty, Oliver Stone, Steven Soderbergh and Barry Levinson.      After completing The Godfather (1972), Al was so broke he actually owed a studio $15,000 so he never saw a paycheck for his work on that film.      Struggled with alcoholism during the start of his career.      Along with Fay Bainter, Teresa Wright, Barry Fitzgerald, Jessica Lange, Sigourney Weaver, Holly Hunter, Emma Thompson, Julianne Moore, Jamie Foxx and Cate Blanchett, he is one of only eleven actors to receive Academy Award nominations in two acting categories in the same year. He was nominated for Best Actor for Scent of a Woman (1992) and Best Supporting Actor for Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) at the 65th Academy Awards in 1993, winning the former award.      In a long-term relationship with Lucila Sol\xe1 since 2009.      Spent his 77th birthday on a beach getaway in Tulum, Mexico with his girlfriend, Lucila Sol\xe1.      Worked various odd jobs to support himself while studying acting.Personal Quotes (75)      The problem with me is, I guess, the way I express myself, you have to be with me 50 years before you can get a sense of what I\'m talking about.      I can\'t say I\'ve been sober though. I don\'t like that word. What does it mean? \'Sober! He\'s very sober\'.      There are times when I have a temperament. Yes, my temperament is there ... but I hope I\'m gentle. Yes, I think I am.      When I try to explain anything I always end up trying to be right usually, but not truthful necessarily. Trying to give the right answer or what I think is the right answer. It\'s a human instinct. You try to be as clever as you can be. You\'re trying to come off like you really know what the hell\'s going on, when you don\'t!      I\'m single and I don\'t particularly like it. I\'m certainly the kind of person who prefers ... it ... it ... It\'s good to have someone in your life that you\'re going through this thing with. It\'s good. That\'s a thing in life that I aspire to.      I like what Norman Mailer said about alcohol: \'Drink has killed a lot of my brain cells and I think I would have been a better writer without it, but it would be one less way to relax.\'      Did you know I started out as a stand-up comic? People don\'t believe me when I tell them.      [on whether acting and his roles reflected who he is] In the end you\'re just playing a role.      I\'ll tell you something. And this is a fact. When I was doing Scarface (1983), I remember being in love at that time. One of the few times in my life. And I was so glad it was at that time. I would come home and she would tell me about her life that day and all her problems and I remember saying to her, \'Look, you really got me through this picture\', because I would shed everything when I came home.      That\'s right! That\'s right! We know the best feeling in the world is the one between the second and third martini. That was my deal. I just enjoyed who I became when I was drinking, so that was something hard to break. I became much quieter, and funny. I must say, that kind of thing came out.      I hope the perception is that I\'m an actor, I never intended to be a movie star.      I\'m constantly striving to break through to something new. You try to maintain a neutral approach to your work, and not be too hard on yourself.      I guess you find yourself repeating certain motifs. But at the heart of it all, I\'m an actor, always looking for a role. And then you try to make things fresh.      People always said that time, the \'70s, was about pretty boys, and then I came along!      One hopes to find out about the [movie] you\'re in while you\'re doing it, not several years later, which is usually when I find out. I\'m like, \'Wow, that was a dud! I didn\'t know, nobody would tell me!\' I\'ve done things for certain reasons, but it [comes from] thinking on your feet... Sometimes actors do things not because we have a great desire [for it], but because it\'s work, and I\'m starting to wonder about that.      But I was just lucky. People like [Francis Ford Coppola] were making films, and I got opportunities.       by Robert Osborne in ""Academy Awards 1974 Oscar Annual""] I couldn\'t exist just doing films. But on the other hand, there is the fame that comes with it, and the money. My problem is I still want to play Hamlet in some little theater somewhere, and time is running out.      [Presenting the Lifetime of Achievement Award to director Sidney Lumet at the 2005 Academy Awards] As an old village poet put it to me in the 1960s. [If you dig it, it\'s yours]. I dug Sidney Lumet back then. I dig him now because what he had to give, I took and made it mine. I\'m forever grateful along with all the other actors and writers who have benefited from Sidney\'s genius.      [on his friend and Heat (1995) co-star Robert De Niro] We know each other\'s minds. We have shared some things that are personal to us, such as our roles. I know Bobby through his roles. But, then, I don\'t think we actually talked about the actual work of actors.      [on his friend and Heat (1995) co-star Robert De Niro] I remember seeing things that Bob had done in the past, and very recent times, and have been taken with the work so much that I even wrote [him] about it. Some of his great work -- which is plenty -- I was staggered by the subtlety of his portrayal and the warmth, which is what we often talk about with Bob among us actors who admire him so. It is the warmth and the way he approaches things.      [on doing Scarecrow (1973) with Gene Hackman] Gene and I are two people not very similar. We had to play a very close relationship, but I just didn\'t think we were as connected as we should have been. We seemed apart. We didn\'t have altercations, we didn\'t hate each other. But we didn\'t communicate, didn\'t think in the same terms. Gene and I were thrown together, but under ordinary circumstances we\'d never cavort or be friends. It was two worlds - but I have to say that I was as much responsible as he was.      [on whether or not acting is still challenging for him] The challenge? It\'s always a challenge of a sort. It\'s a challenge to get up and go and leave your family and go out there in all different parts of the world and do a picture and try to make it come alive . . . You\'re still challenged for that. I mean, it\'s the same story. It\'s just not changed. It seems to be the same thing it always was. It\'s this effort. If you get excited about a thing then things are generally a little easier. If you get enthusiastic and you want to do something and you feel you are into something then things start to come. But usually to find the enthusiasm and the appetite, that\'s the challenge.      [on why his film Chinese Coffee (2000) has yet to be released] \'Coffee\' is done, I got a couple of little important things to do about it, like little tiny things, and THEN I will unveil it. It\'s not a movie that you put in a . . . it needs a certain environment to flourish in. It\'s just the way it is. It doesn\'t make it better or worse than the picture. It\'s just the way it is, the nature of it.      I\'ve always believed, I always hoped . . . I don\'t think I know what I\'m saying when I say this, but I was hoping that we could have a museum where we had films. That there was a museum where films were, like, hung. Like paintings. And you went to the museum. I got the movie The Local Stigmatic (1990) that I made. It\'s 52 minutes and everybody has seen it now because I\'ve personally got them in to see it, to show it to them and I paid them for it, too. But it\'s over at the Museum of Modern Art and I love saying . . . This is really pretentious of me, this is what I really like. I love to say: \'Oh, it\'s at the Museum of Modern Art. Isn\'t that great?\' \'Have you released it?\' \'No, I never did.\' I love saying that, you know? \'How come?\' \'Because I didn\'t feel like it.\' It\'s fun to do that.      The actor becomes an emotional athlete. The process is painful -- my personal life suffers.      My first language was shy. It\'s only by having been thrust into the limelight that I have learned to cope with my shyness.      I don\'t understand the hatred and fear of gays and bisexuals and lesbians...it\'s a concept I honestly cannot grasp. To me, it\'s not who you love...a man, a woman, what have you...it\'s the fact THAT you love. That is all that truly matters.      [When asked what romantic character he would want to be] [Pablo Picasso]. I love the idea that he used to just sit and stare at an empty canvas for as long as 12 hours straight. If you keep staring at the canvas, the hope is that something or someone will come to mind. That\'s a romantic notion in itself.      [When asked what a movie of his life would be called and who would play him] It would be called \'The Dustin Hoffman Story\'. When we were starting out, [Robert De Niro], me and Hoffman were always sort of mixed up. People mistook us for each other.      In America most everybody who\'s Italian is half Italian. Except me. I\'m all Italian. I\'m mostly Sicilian, and I have a little bit of Neapolitan in me. You get your full dose with me.      [on The Godfather: Part III (1990)] You know what the problem with that film is? The real problem? Nobody wants to see Michael have retribution and feel guilty. That\'s not who he is. In the other scripts, in Michael\'s mind he is avenging his family and saving them. Michael never thinks of himself as a gangster - not as a child, not while he is one and not afterward. That is not the image he has of himself. He\'s not a part of the Goodfellas (1990) thing. Michael has this code; he lives by something that makes audiences respond. But once he goes away from that and starts crying over coffins, making confessions and feeling remorse, it isn\'t right. I applaud [Francis Ford Coppola] for trying to get to that, but Michael is so frozen in that image. There is in him a deep feeling of having betrayed his mother by killing his brother. That was a mistake. And we are ruled by these mistakes in life as time goes on. He was wrong. Like in Scarface (1983) when Tony kills Manny - that is wrong, and he pays for it. And in his way, Michael pays for it.      My dad was in the army. World War II. He got his college education from the army. After World War II he became an insurance salesman. Really, I didn\'t know my dad very well.      [on Julie Christie] The most poetic of actresses.      The only problem is, I don\'t have the appetite to make my own pictures. I don\'t want to direct. So I\'m always in a kind of passive position, waiting for someone to come to me with a project... That I sort of don\'t like.      [on Heat (1995)] I remember chasing Bobby De Niro around at 3 a.m. I didn\'t warm up and boom, there went my hamstring. I was like, ""Great, I feel like old Al."" Then I realized, ""I AM old Al."" I guess I have to keep in shape as I get older. But I don\'t like to work out. Whenever I get the urge to exercise, I lie down until it passes.      [on Jack Lemmon] Jack was the most selfless actor I\'ve ever worked with. He was the most considerate and the most generous. He cared a great deal about what he was doing. He was a complete actor who gave 150 percent. But the remarkable thing about Jack was that he kept growing. So his best work was his latest work.      [on making The Godfather (1972)] Every time I\'d run into Marlon Brando on set, my face would turn red and I\'d start laughing...have you any idea what it was like to do a scene with Brando? I sat in movie houses when I was a kid watching Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and Viva Zapata! (1952). Now I\'m playing a scene with him. He\'s God, man!      It surprised me, the feeling I got when I won the Oscar for Scent of a Woman (1992). It was a new feeling. I\'d never felt it. I don\'t see my Oscar much now. But when I first got it, there was a feeling for weeks afterward that I guess is akin to winning a gold medal in the Olympics. It\'s like you\'ve won a race and everybody knows you won. It\'s a wonderful feeling, a complete feeling.      An actor with too much money will usually find a way to get rid of it.      He who persists at his folly will one day be wise.      After every movie, Humphrey Bogart -- even at the end -- was very worried he\'d never get another part. If you don\'t get the job, there\'s no work, there\'s no outlet, there\'s no expression, there\'s no painting. You just live and hope that another day will come with a role that will serve as a canvas for you.Gary Cooper was kind of a phenomenon - his ability to take something and elevate it, give it such dignity. One of the great presences. Charles Laughton was my favorite. Jack Nicholson has that kind of persona; he\'s also a fine actor. Robert Mitchum\'s great. Lee Marvin, too. These guys are terrific actors.      I recommend watching The Dresser (1983). It\'s a great movie if you want to know about actors.      I am a dancer, but I don\'t think I would be on Dancing with the Stars (2005) mainly because I would be too shy.      The most popular movie I\'ve ever made is Scarface (1983), all over the world. It\'s amazing to me. It\'s wonderful. We sometimes forget that it was Oliver Stone who wrote it. He is a political creature, and I think that is an undercurrent in the movie. And the combination of him and Brian De Palma made for this kind of fusion or explosion. It worked.      (1979, on Marlon Brando) There\'s no doubt every time I see Brando that I\'m looking at a great actor. Whether he\'s doing great acting or not, you\'re seeing somebody who is in the tradition of a great actor. What he does with it, that\'s something else, but he\'s got it all. The talent, the instrument is there, that\'s why he has endured. I remember when I first saw On the Waterfront. I had to see it again, right there. I couldn\'t move, I couldn\'t leave the theater. I had never seen the likes of it. I couldn\'t believe it.      (1979, Playboy Magazine) Bang the Drum Slowly is my all-time-favorite film. I saw that three or four times. I\'d like to go see it again. The baseball motif, the quality of the relationship between Moriarty and De Niro, is beautiful. Maybe I relate to it because I wanted to be a baseball player. For some reason, people don\'t talk about that movie.      (1979 quote on his first time at the Oscars) I was at the Oscars once, for Serpico. That was the second time I was nominated. I was sitting in the third or fourth row with Diane Keaton. Jeff Bridges was there with his girl. No one expected me to come. I was a little high. Somebody had done something to my hair, blew it or something, and I looked like I had a bird\'s nest on my head, a real mess. I sat there and tried to look indifferent because I was so nervous. Any time I\'m nervous, I try to put on an indifferent or a cold look. At one point, I turned to Jeff Bridges and said, ""Hey, looks like there won\'t be time to get to the Best Actor awards."" He gave me a strange look. He said, ""Oh, really?"" I said, ""It\'s over, the hour is up."" He said, ""It\'s three hours long."" I thought it was an hour TV show, can you imagine that? And I had to pee-bad. So I popped a Valium. Actually, I was eating Valium like they were candy. Chewed on them. Finally came the Best Actor. Can you imagine the shape I was in? I couldn\'t have made it to the stage. I was praying, ""Please don\'t let it be me. Please."" And I hear . . . ""Jack Lemmon."" I was just so happy I didn\'t have to get up, because I never would have made it.      [1979, Playboy Magazine] I wanted to be a baseball player, naturally, but I wasn\'t good enough. I didn\'t know what I was going to do with my life. I just had a kind of energy, I was a fairly happy kid, although I had problems in school. In the eighth grade, the drama teacher wrote my mother a letter saying she should encourage me. I used to recite The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. And I would read the Bible in the auditorium. That was the first time I heard of Marlon Brando. I was in a play and they said, ""Hey, Marlon Brando - this guy acts like Marlon Brando."" Isn\'t that weird? I was about 12. I guess it was because I was supposed to get sick onstage and I really did get sick every time we did this play. Actually, the person I related to was James Dean. I grew up with the Dean thing. Rebel Without a Cause (1955) had a very powerful effect on me.      (1979, on his beginning as an actor at the High School of Performing Arts) I was never very happy with performing; it didn\'t turn me on much. If I made a catch at third base, I\'d do a double somersault and sprawl out on the ground. I was acting-overacting. They taught Stanislavsky at Performing Arts. That whole thing about the Method and serious acting, having to feel it, I thought it was crazy. What was going on? Where was the fun? So I was kind of bored with it.      (1979, on his pre-fame job as a building superintendent) I was about 26. My friend told me about this job with a rent-free apartment and $14 a week. So I went down and got a boiler\'s permit and came back and I was a super. It was my first real place that was not a rooming house or sharing with a girl-I had lived with a girl before that. Now I had my own little home. I had no money, hardly anything to eat, but I had a roof over my head. I was a super for 11 months. I drank, actually, but I hung in there and came out of it. It was a very fruitful time and, at the same time, it was the lowest time in my life. I used to hang an 8 x 10 glossy of me on the door.      [on people considering him a legend] I\'m very flattered to hear that, that compliment. I don\'t think of myself as anything but an actor struggling to find the next role and when I do get the role to try and see if I can find any way into it.      With young actors I learn from them, just as hopefully I always will. If I were to advise them in some way, I would say this is a craft that you just have to keep doing. Do it whenever you can and you shouldn\'t spend too much time dealing with the fact that there\'s a world out there with a lot of competition. You have to educate yourself. You have to read. You have to see things that are inspiring to you.      [on the casting of Michael Corleone in The Godfather (1972)] Francis [Ford Coppola] knew I could do the part, and so did I. But he kept asking me to test again and again. I didn\'t want to go. I don\'t go where I\'m not wanted. Once I got the role, I was waking up at four or five in the morning and going into the kitchen to brood over [it].      [on preparing to play the character of Tony Montana in Scarface (1983)] I worked with an expert in knife combat, with a physical education guy who helped me get the kind of body I wanted for the part. I used the boxer Roberto Dur\xe1n a little bit. There was an aspect of Dur\xe1n , a certain lion in him that I responded to in this character. And I was very inspired by Meryl Streep\'s work in Sophie\'s Choice (1982). I thought that her way of involving herself in playing someone who is from another country and another world was particularly fine and committed and... courageous.      I\'m the same now as I\'ve always been - sort of a recluse. People resent me for remaining myself when they think I should be acting like a superstar. I never wanted to be an actor and I don\'t particularly enjoy it. I have to act. There just isn\'t anything else for me.      [on being in Dublin, Ireland] I always feel so at home here, it\'s great. In fact, I just want to do a movie here so then I could really stay for a while, get around and see it, and be a part of it.      [on the tough neighborhood he grew up in] They used to call it Fort Apache - the 41st Precinct. But that was the start of the heroin thing. Around 1948 that\'s when the drugs came into New York. That\'s when the trouble started. Of all my dearest, closest friends from that time, none of them survived.      [on his acting teacher Lee Strasberg] Someone said to him: \'Oh, I know you.\' He replied: \'You know my name. You don\'t know me\'.      [on being offered the part of Michael Corleone in The Godfather (1972)] Naturally my first thought was: \'I can\'t play that. It\'s a really hard part. Can\'t I play Sonny? That\'s a good part.\' Then all this screen testing began. It was the Scarlett O\'Hara of its day. Francis put that cast together and they okayed everybody except for me and Marlon Brando. Finally, they okayed Marlon. \'But this kid? No way!\'      [on working with Marlon Brando in The Godfather (1972)] I loved him. He was such a sensitive person. He saw the difficulties I was having and I think he saw a little of himself when he was young. I was in awe. I remember once he came up behind me and gave me a little massage. \'You okay?\' he\'d say.      Something happened in the 1980s that is hard to define. It had something to do with the movies that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas - both very close friends of Francis Ford Coppola - started to make. I met them when they were kids. I saw them as real film people. I got no feeling of theatre from them. They are geniuses. But they set the standard for a new kind of movie. You also can\'t discount the impact of television. It\'s a complex story. Those socially concerned movies like Serpico (1973) or Dog Day Afternoon (1975) or Taxi Driver (1976) were no longer as doable. Those films became independent film. They were no longer launched as brassy marquee features. That\'s exactly right. You look at The Panic in Needle Park (1971): a film about two drug addicts in the city. That was made by Fox. They could never get that made today.      [on Scarface (1983)] We couldn\'t show our faces after it opened. I was at a party after a screening at Sardi\'s. I walked in and the faces looked like those in a wax museum. People were sitting so still. Liza Minnelli was there. She hadn\'t seen the movie. She came up to me and said: \'What did you do to these people?\' And yet it survived.      The first thing that comes to mind about Sea of Love (1989)? Ellen Barkin\'s body.      [on rejecting the role of John McClane in Die Hard (1988)] I gave that boy [Bruce Willis] a career.      I was smoking at nine and smoking a pipe by 12... well, I was dramatic. The cop on the beat used to buy us booze when I was 13 and 14. He was a great guy. He would say, \'Have a little of this\', and he would keep a watch on us. I don\'t know that it would be politically correct but he is not working anymore and is long retired.      [on turning down the part of Han Solo in Star Wars (1977)] That role was mine for the taking but I couldn\'t understand the script.      [on The Godfather trilogy] A long, awful, tiring story.      I asked God for a bike, but I know God doesn\'t work that way. So I stole a bike and asked for forgiveness.      [on directing] I have worked with many great film directors and seen that there is a level of film-making that I can never get to so I don\'t even bother. I just enjoy engaging in film as an amateur. I don\'t have the pressure of having to deliver. I am off the hook.      [on being off-screen from 1985 to 1989] I poured my own money into my own film, The Local Stigmatic (1990). Which I never released. I did some plays. All of a sudden the years passed and suddenly I owed some back taxes and the mortgage was due and I was broke. But you know what really hit me? I was walking through Central Park and this guy comes up to me - didn\'t know him at all - and he says, \'Hey, what happened to you? We don\'t see you, man.\' I said, \'Well, I... uh... uh...\' and he said, \'C\'mon Al, I want to see you up there.\' And I recognized that I was lucky to have what I\'ve been given. You gotta use it.      [on one\'s career] I think that the idea of resurgence is wonderful. But basically I think it\'s just luck. Also, if you start to say, \'How about if I made a movie with this person who is really a good director?\' or \'How about if I did a movie about something that I feel I\'ve got something to say about?\' These things happen and I feel you\'re lucky when it happens.      [on Diane Keaton getting him back into movies after a four-year hiatus in the 1980s] I\'d probably be a short-order cook right now if it wasn\'t for Diane. I\'d become kind of detached from everything and I was enjoying a life out of the mix. She\'s the one who found Sea of Love (1989) and told me I should do it. She said, \'You\'re not on the A-list anymore, buddy. Are you going to go back to living in a rooming house? You\'ve been rich too long. You\'re an adult now.\'""      [on Johnny Depp] -- Johnny is one of the greatest actors of his generation. He has incredible instincts. He\'s able to put himself into the head of his character and vary his level according to the needs of each scene. That\'s a very rare gift.      [on becoming famous] The reaction wasn\'t positive. I was catapulted out of a cannon. People are more accepting of fame today because of all the media outlets. Young people even aspire to it. I became more aware of myself, constantly reminded that I had this name because strangers kept calling me by it. Being an outsider is part of being an artist. You try to conform. But some of us just can\'t. I didn\'t know what was expected of me. I still don\'t.Salary (8)The Godfather\xa0(1972)      $35,000       The Godfather: Part II\xa0(1974)      $500,000 and 10% of the gross after break-even      ...and justice for all.\xa0(1979)      $1,000,000       The Godfather: Part III\xa0(1990)      $5,000,000       Glengarry Glen Ross\xa0(1992)      $1,500,000       Carlito\'s Way\xa0(1993)      $6,000,000       Insomnia\xa0(2002)       ca. $11,000,000      S1m0ne\xa0(2002)      $11,000,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","[u'\nJames Caan ', u'""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 84 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(4)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(45)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(27)\xa0|Salary\xa0(3)  Overview (4)Date of Birth26\xa0March1940,\xa0The Bronx, New York, USA Birth NameJames Edmund CaanNicknameJimmy    Height5\'\xa09\xbc""\xa0(1.76\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          A masculine and enigmatic actor whose life and movie career have had more ups and downs than the average rollercoaster and whose selection of roles has arguably derailed him from achieving true superstar status, James Caan is New York-born and bred.He was born in the Bronx, to Sophie (Falkenstein) and Arthur Caan, Jewish immigrants from Germany. His father was a meat dealer and butcher. The athletically gifted Caan played football at Michigan State University while studying economics, holds a black belt in karate and for several years was even a regular on the rodeo circuit, where he was nicknamed ""The Jewish Cowboy"". However, while studying at Hofstra University, he became intrigued by acting and was interviewed and accepted at Sanford Meisner\'s Neighborhood Playhouse. He then won a scholarship to study under acting coach Wynn Handman and began to appear in several off-Broadway productions, including ""I Roam"" and ""Mandingo"".He made his screen debut as a sailor in Irma la Douce (1963) and began to impress audiences with his work in Red Line 7000 (1965) and the western El Dorado (1967) alongside John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. Further work followed in Journey to Shiloh (1968) and in the sensitive The Rain People (1969). However, audiences were moved to tears as he put in a heart-rending performance as cancer-stricken Chicago Bears running back Brian Piccolo in the highly rated made-for-TV film Brian\'s Song (1971).With these strong performances under his belt, Francis Ford Coppola then cast him as hot-tempered gangster Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone in the Mafia epic The Godfather (1972). The film was an enormous success, Caan scored a Best Supporting Actor nomination and, in the years since, the role has proven to be the one most fondly remembered by his legion of fans. He reprised the role for several flashback scenes in the sequel The Godfather: Part II (1974) and then moved on to several very diverse projects. These included a cop-buddy crime partnership with Alan Arkin in the uneven Freebie and the Bean (1974), a superb performance as a man playing for his life in The Gambler (1974) alongside Lauren Hutton, and pairing with Barbra Streisand in Funny Lady (1975). Two further strong lead roles came up for him in 1975, first as futuristic sports star ""Jonathon E"" questioning the moral fiber of a sterile society in Rollerball (1975) and teaming up with Robert Duvall in the Sam Peckinpah spy thriller The Killer Elite (1975).Unfortunately, Caan\'s rising star sputtered badly at this stage of his career, and several film projects failed to find fire with either critics or audiences. These included such failures as the hokey Harry and Walter Go to New York (1976), the quasi-western Comes a Horseman (1978) and the saccharine Chapter Two (1979). However, he did score again with the stylish Michael Mann-directed heist movie Thief (1981). He followed this with a supernatural romantic comedy titled Kiss Me Goodbye (1982) and then, due to personal conflicts, dropped out of the spotlight for several years before returning with a stellar performance under old friend Francis Ford Coppola in the moving Gardens of Stone (1987).Caan appeared back in favor with fans and critics alike and raised his visibility with the sci-fi hit Alien Nation (1988) and Dick Tracy (1990), then surprised everyone by playing a meek romance novelist held captive after a car accident by a deranged fan in the dynamic Misery (1990). The 1990s were kind to him and he notched up roles as a band leader in For the Boys (1991), another gangster in Honeymoon in Vegas (1992), appeared in the indie hit Bottle Rocket (1996) and pursued Arnold Schwarzenegger in Eraser (1996).The demand on Caan\'s talents seems to have increased steadily over the past few years as he is making himself known to a new generation of fans. Recent hot onscreen roles have included The Yards (2000), City of Ghosts (2002) and Dogville (2003). In addition, he finds himself at the helm of the hit TV series Las Vegas (2003) as casino security chief ""Big Ed"" Deline. An actor of undeniably manly appeal, James Caan continues to surprise and delight audiences with his invigorating performances.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       firehouse44          Spouse (4) Linda Stokes (7 October\xa01995            - present)\xa0(filed for divorce)\xa0(2 children)                         Ingrid Hajek          (9 September\xa01990            - 29 March\xa01995)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)           Sheila Ryan (12 January\xa01976            - 7 December\xa01976)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)           Dee Jay Mattis (8 July\xa01961            - 1966)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)          Trivia (45)      Played football for Michigan State University.      Born at 10:31pm-EST.      Father (with Sheila Ryan) of actor Scott Caan.      Was offered the role of McMurphy in One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest (1975).      In the 1990s, he kicked a cocaine habit of some 20 years.      States that Thief (1981) is one of his favorite films.      Son of Arthur & Sophie Caan. His father was a kosher butcher.      Turned down plum roles in MASH (1970) & Apocalypse Now (1979).      Briefly lived at the Playboy Mansion in the 1970s.      One brother, Ronnie Caan, and one sister, Barbara (deceased c. 1981--leukemia).      Some sources give his birth year as 1939.      Was originally tested for the role of Sonny Corleone in The Godfather (1972) (director Francis Ford Coppola had worked with him and Robert Duvall in The Rain People (1969) and wanted them in the movie), but then was slated to play Michael Corleone after Paramount\'s initial choices (which included Warren Beatty, Robert Redford and Ryan O\'Neal) did not pan out. When Al Pacino came on board, Caan was switched back to Sonny.      Spent 9 years on the pro rodeo circuit.      Is a 6th Dan in Karate.      Was a drama major at Hofstra University on Long Island, New York.      Sons with Linda Stokes: James Arthur Caan (b. 6 November 1995) and Jacob Nicholas Caan (b. September 24th 1998).      After being turned down by Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino, Julia Phillips inquired of Caan\'s agent if he would be interested in taking the lead role of Roy Neary in Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Caan\'s agent responded that he would read the script for a guarantee of $1 million plus 10% of the gross if he accepted the role. Phillips went with the original choice, Richard Dreyfuss.      Was considered by George Lucas for the role of Han Solo in Star Wars (1977).      Two generations of his family and the Coppola family have worked together. He worked with Francis Ford Coppola most memorably in the first two Godfather films (The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather: Part II (1974)) and in Gardens of Stone (1987). His son, Scott Caan, appeared in Sonny (2002), which was directed by Nicolas Cage and featured Cage and his brother, Marc Coppola. Sonny was also the name of Caan\'s ""Godfather"" character.      Appears in Misery (1990), which was directed by Rob Reiner. His son, Scott Caan, appeared in Ocean\'s Eleven (2001) and Ocean\'s Twelve (2004), opposite Reiner\'s father, Carl Reiner.      In the Godfather trilogy, Andy Garcia plays the son of Caan\'s character, Sonny Corleone. In Ocean\'s Eleven (2001) and Ocean\'s Twelve (2004), Caan\'s son, Scott Caan, works with Garcia.      Grew up in Sunnyside, Queens, New York City.      In his youth, his nicknames were ""Shoulders"" and ""Killer Caan"".      While on sabbatical from acting he coached a Little League baseball team, there was one incident where his team\'s weakest player hit a home run that won a game. This incident is claimed by Caan as one of the greatest moments of his life.      His film contracts during his rodeo days had written in them that he could not compete in rodeos during filming. This was for fear he would injure or kill himself.      According to the British documentary The Godfather and the Mob (2006), Caan was regularly seen with Gambino family underboss Carmine Persico (aka ""Junior"") during the filming of The Godfather (1972). As Persico was under surveillance by the FBI at the time, Caan came under almost equal scrutiny.      Has a son named Alexander James Caan (b. April 10th 1991) with Ingrid Hajek.      Studied in Rhodes High School in New York.      Studied in The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theater in New York.      Studied Economics in Michigan State University.      Tested for the role of Ted Henderson in Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969).      During the making of Mickey Blue Eyes (1999), he nicknamed Hugh Grant ""Whippy"" after the Whippet, an English breed of dog that shivers a lot.      Lives in Beverly Hills, California.      His parents, Sophie (Falkenstein) and Arthur Caan, were both German Jews.      Has a daughter, Tara A. Caan (born November 5, 1964), with first wife Dee Jay Mattis.      Avid golfer.      Frequent guest/player at celebrity golf events.      Republican.      Turned down Jack Nicholson\'s role in One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest (1975). Not one to repeat that mistake, he accepted the lead role in Misery (1990) when Nicholson turned it down. Both films involved the lead character being at the mercy of a sadistic nurse.      He appeared in two Best Picture Academy Award winners: The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather: Part II (1974).      Although he played John Cazale\'s elder brother in The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather: Part II (1974), he is five years his junior in real life.      He was considered for the role of Tom Hagen in The Godfather (1972) before Robert Duvall was cast. He eventually played Sonny Corleone in both that film and The Godfather: Part II (1974).      Although he played Morgana King\'s son in The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather: Part II (1974), he is only ten years her junior in real life.      Two of his memorable scenes from The Godfather (1972) have been parodied on The Simpsons. The scene where Sonny beats up Carlo in the street was turned into a scene where Marge does the same to a man who mugged her. Sonny\'s death scene has actually been parodied twice. The first time involved Bart being ambushed with snowballs at school. The second actually involved Caan himself making a guest appearance, and being ambushed at a tollbooth again.      He has appeared in four films directed by Francis Ford Coppola: The Rain People (1969), The Godfather (1972), The Godfather: Part II (1974) and Gardens of Stone (1987).Personal Quotes (27)      [on being voted ""Italian of the Year"" in New York twice, after his role as Sonny Corleone in The Godfather (1972)]: I\'m a Jew from the Bronx. I feel guilty about accepting these awards, but they wouldn\'t let me turn them down.      I have an agent I trust professionally more than anybody else, but with the best intentions he could put me in the shithouse just as fast as somebody who wanted to ruin me.      I\'d rather get sloshed than stoned.      Anyone of my generation who tells you he hasn\'t ""done"" Brando [Marlon Brando] is lying.      My acting technique is to look up at God just before the camera rolls and say, \'Give me a break.\'      I never did anything else. In college I switched majors every two weeks and acting was the only thing that held my interest. The reason I started was to stay away from the meat market. That\'s where I was headed -- to be with the guys who lug beef all day long.      Quite often I\'m misunderstood when I say, \'It\'s not my life, it\'s my job.\' People think that means I don\'t give a shit. Sure, I want to be the best actor in the world. But my life is my family, my son, my friends. I don\'t know how anyone can find fault with that. For some reason when you say, \'It\'s my job\' it sounds like \'Who gives a shit?\' Well, that\'s not it at all. What I do quite honestly and seriously and not in any way being humble is not as important as what the garbage collector does. People make actors important. I go to the movies, I stand on line minding my own business and the manager goes, \'Mr. Caan, Mr. Caan.\' And I say, \'No, no, no, I\'m OK. I\'ll stand on the line.\' \'Oh, you can\'t.\' So, finally they take you through the line and the other 40 people go, \'Hey, Mr. Bigshot.\' And I was just minding my own business, I just wanted to stand there. But other people make it very important that I\'m an actor.      I loved Funny Lady (1975) for whatever reason. People say they didn\'t know I could sing and dance. Well, nobody ever asks me - it\'s always ""Punch this guy"".      [on recent big-budget Hollywood films] [They] absolutely stink. All those pictures, those big extravaganzas - you can\'t remember any characters. Either they had an animal head on them or walked funny . . . If they want me to work, I\'ll go, ""Sure"". Basically, I\'m a whore.      [on Zabriskie Point (1970)] It was the worst fucking - and I have to curse because there is no other way that I can express myself - picture that I ever saw. I got so angry about it. I was in love with a girl. We went to the movie and it ended the whole affair. He [Michelangelo Antonioni] hired cardboard, the worst actors, and it was a conscious effort - that\'s what pissed me off.      [on actors taking themselves too seriously] The truth is . . . myself, De Niro [Robert De Niro], Pacino [Al Pacino], Hoffman [Dustin Hoffman], we were arrogant, pompous asses.      If it was up to them, I\'d be playing Sonny Corleone my entire life. Usually, if there weren\'t eight people dead by page 11, they wouldn\'t send me the script. People say, ""Gee, you do a lot of mafia movies"". I think I\'ve done two, out of 60.      [about living at the Playboy mansion] Actually, it was for medicinal purposes - I was just getting divorced. This doctor wrote me a prescription to live there because he thought it would help me get over the pain of my divorce. My God, it worked. I got over it pretty quickly.      I\'ll see a beautiful girl walking up to me and I\'ll think, ""Oh, my God, I can\'t believe my good luck"". But then she\'ll say, ""Where\'s your son?"" or ""My mother loves you.""      I had great, great times as a Little League coach. People were talking about me quitting acting, and they would say, ""What about your creative juices?"" Coaching is creative, because you could take a kid who thought he wasn\'t any good and, within four minutes, change his mind. And I didn\'t have to wait six months for them to put music to it. How good a Little League coach was I? I was a little hyper. One thing I learned was that talent comes from everywhere; it doesn\'t have to come just from the ghetto. But in Beverly Hills, because Daddy has a grocery store, the kids lack a lot of try.      There\'s a big difference between wanting to work and having to work. And I had to learn that the hard way. Now money is very important to me, because I ain\'t got it.      [on being confused with his character from The Godfather (1972)] I\'ll bump into a guy in a bar, and he\'ll say, ""I\'m sorry, Sonny!"" It\'s surreal.      A ""Godfather Four""? Not by Francis [Francis Ford Coppola], anyway. Who cares? There shouldn\'t have been a The Godfather: Part III (1990).      You know those actors who say, ""I want to be alone"" or they\'re walking around with their friggin\' bodyguards? A bodyguard! I\'d never have a bodyguard. I mean, who wants to hurt me? But the point is that they have the bodyguard so that they can say, ""Leave me alone!"" It\'s this revolving door thing. If somebody didn\'t recognize them, they\'d have a heart attack, the bastards.      [on fans confusing him with his characters] Look, you only pray when you start in this business that you get to the point where people recognize you or quote you. I mean, I\'ve got a lot of people who are like, ""Hey, your ankle OK?"" from Misery (1990). I get that a lot. It\'s harmless. Or they\'ll say, ""Hey, don\'t go through that toll booth again"" or ""Have the right change"". That\'s great! First of all, it means that they remember the picture. There\'s nothing not to like about it . . . No, I hope they never stop.      I did this picture last year with Nicole Kidman and Lars von Trier, Dogville (2003), and it\'s supposed to be a trilogy, but now that she\'s walked away from it, I\'m walking from it. He is very anti-American, so screw him. I\'m very pro-America. I\'m a conservative, basically.      I went through some bad times, some very self-destructive stuff, you know, when I was on top. I\'d got involved in partying and doing all that and I lost my sister and, basically, I got all screwed up in my head. She was like my best friend and I lost her to leukemia and I was just a mess. I had a lot of money because I\'d worked a lot and saved it. I had it in a pension plan and then I lost all my money. My accountant. I just woke up one morning and I didn\'t have a dime. We\'re talking about tons . . . I mean, a lot of money, and I was flat broke.      [His advice to younger actors] The main pearl of wisdom I give these young kids is that you shouldn\'t make your career your whole life. No matter what heights you achieve, even if you\'re Brad Pitt, the slide is coming, sure as death and taxes. So if you put everything into that one basket - acting - you\'ll wind up hurting yourself, either with drugs or any other self-destructive thing you can think of.      [on figuring out how to play Sonny Corleone] I didn\'t have to work on an accent or anything, but I couldn\'t quite get a grasp. I was shaving to go to dinner or something, and for some reason I started thinking of Don Rickles. Because I knew Rickles. Somebody was watching over me and gave me this thing: being Rickles, kind of say-anything, do-anything.      I won\'t mention names, but in my career, the most talented people invariably are the easiest and nicest to get along with. The ones that are difficult try to camouflage the fact that they haven\'t got shit to offer. So they complain about frilly things that really don\'t mean a shit, like their dressing rooms, makeup.      (On turning down One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest (1975)) Four or five different directors came to me with that at different times. I go, \'It\'s not a movie. Who wants to look at four institution walls?\' Milos Forman made it great. Jack was great in it. I made a flat-out, fucking mistake.      (On turning down Kramer vs. Kramer (1979)) I was first, Dustin [Hoffman] was last on the list of five guys they wanted. The director [Robert Benton] kept it up with me for three months. I said, \'This is middle-class, bourgeois horseshit.\' I mean, \'Cut to kid crying.\' Oh, please.

He was originally a construction company manager, then he gained work with the New Yiddish Theatre, before breaking into film near his thirtieth birthday. However in 1970, in only his fourth film, Castellano received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance in Lovers and Other Strangers (1970) and came to the attention of casting agents for The Godfather (1972). After his strong showing as a tough hoodlum in The Godfather (1972), he became somewhat typecast as a screen criminal and appeared in further crime films including Honor Thy Father (1973) and Gangster Wars (1981).He died in December 1988 from a heart attack at the age of 55.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       firehouse44@hotmail.com          Spouse (2)               Margaret Tiernan          (1953            - ?)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)           Ardell Sheridan (?            - 10 December\xa01988)\xa0(his death)          Trivia (6)      Specialized in playing overweight characters. His normal weight was about 200 pounds, but producers invariably insisted that he gain at least 50 pounds for roles.      In the DVD commentary of The Godfather (1972), Francis Ford Coppola says that Castellano was not in The Godfather: Part II (1974) because he wanted to have someone else (of his choosing) write his dialogue. According to Castellano\'s widow, Ardell Sheridan, Castellano was dropped by Coppola because refused to regain the weight to play Clemenza due to health reasons.      Has played the father of Bruno Kirby, in The Super (1972), and an older version of Bruno Kirby\'s character, Clemenza, in The Godfather (1972).      Was nominated for Broadway\'s 1969 Tony Award as Best Supporting or Featured Actor (Dramatic) for Lovers and Other Strangers (1970) a part he recreated in an Oscar nominated performance in the film version of the same name, Lovers and Other Strangers (1970).      Richard\'s widow, Ardell Sheridan published a book in 2002 detailing his contributions in the making of The Godfather (1972). Able to recall true-life experiences growing up in a mob family, Richard\'s experiences helped Francis Ford Coppola when needing to tighten up the script. The book states that Richard kept an inexperienced Al Pacino from getting fired by making slight adjustments in Pacino\'s characterization as Michael Corleone that not only helped Pacino keep his job, but enhanced the complexity of his character. Castellano was also instrumental in helping Marlon Brando understand Vito Corleone\'s motivations, but reports that their relationship suffered due to Brando\'s bruised ego. According to the book, Richard was the only other actor who was considered for Don Corleone\'s role after Brando\'s screen test for the part. Both Richard and Ardell rewrote the Genco Oil scene when the version written by Francis Ford Coppola wasn\'t working.      Nephew of Paul Castellano.Personal Quotes (1)      [on why he was not in The Godfather: Part II (1974)] I saw Clemenza as a teacher. He teaches how to make spaghetti, how to use the gun. [Coppola] can\'t tell me that Clemenza, after years of loyalty to the old man, would go in and testify against organized crime. Not unless you proved to me... that he had become a fearful man, that he had become a betrayer. The demands on me were impossible. I had settled on a price and everybody else\'s was settled upon mine. [Coppola] had me losing weight to play Clemenza as a young man. I was down to 194 pounds. When I received the script five minutes later, it had me rolling in at 300 pounds... The next thing, I saw Coppola quoted as saying that I asked for more money than anyone else, that I asked to rewrite the script.

Though composed of characteristics of many gangsters, the Vito Corleone character is based largely on those of Frank Costello and Carlo Gambino. Like Costello, Vito has a raspy voice, has politicians and judges on his payroll, discourages others getting into the narcotics business, and has many gambling interests. Like Gambino, Vito is very cunning.In Puzo\'s novel, Vito is the head of the Corleone crime family, the most powerful Mafia family in the New York City area if not the country. He is depicted as an ambitious Italian immigrant who moves to Hell\'s Kitchen and builds a Mafia empire, yet retains (and strictly adheres to) his own personal code of honor. His youngest son, Michael Corleone, becomes the Don upon his death at the end of the novel. He has two other sons, Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone and Fredo Corleone, and a daughter, Connie Corleone, all of whom play major roles in the story. He also informally adopted another son, Tom Hagen, who grew up to become the Family\'s consigliere.Early lifeIn the chronology of the Godfather saga, Vito first appears in 1901 as a young boy in the small Sicilian town of Corleone. As documented in the novel (and in Godfather Part II), his father, Antonio Andolini, is murdered by the local Mafia boss, Don Ciccio, because he refused to pay tribute to him. His older brother, Paolo, swears revenge, but is himself murdered soon after. Eventually, Ciccio\'s henchmen come to the residence of the Andolinis to take Vito away and have him killed. Desperate, Signora Andolini takes her son to see the mafia chieftain herselfImmigration to AmericaWhen Vito\'s mother goes to see Don Ciccio, she begs him to spare Vito. However, Ciccio refuses, reasoning that Vito would also seek revenge as an adult. Upon Ciccio\'s refusal, Signora Andolini puts a knife to his throat, allowing her son to escape, but is then murdered by Ciccio\'s guards. (In the novel, she survives being shot and later reunites with her son in Sicily many years later.) Later that night, he is smuggled away, fleeing Sicily to seek refuge in America on a cargo ship full of immigrants. In the novel, he deliberately changes his name to Corleone, after his home town. The movie, however, plays that he is renamed ""Vito Corleone"" because the immigration workers at Ellis Island mistake ""Andolini"" for his middle name and the name of his town for his last name. According to The Godfather: Part II, he later adopted the middle name ""Andolini"" to acknowledge his heritage, though this could have been done posthumously by his family.Adopted by the Abbandando familyCorleone is later adopted by the Abbandando family in New York City\'s Hell\'s Kitchen, Manhattan, and he befriends their son, Genco, who becomes like a brother to him. Corleone begins making an honest living at Abbandando\'s grocery store on Ninth Avenue, but loses the job, as an intimidated Abbandando is forced to fire Vito to make room for the nephew of Don Fanucci, a blackhander and the local neighborhood padrone.Corleone soon learns to survive and prosper through petty crime and performing favors in return for loyalty. During this time, he also befriends two other low-level hoods, Peter Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio. In 1919, he commits his first murder, killing Fanucci, who had tried to extort money from him. Corleone chooses the day of a major festival to spy on Fanucci from the rooftops as Fanucci goes home, and surprises him at the door to his apartment. He shoots Fanucci three times, as the din from the festival drowns out the noise from the gunshots.Rise as an olive oil importerAs a young man, Corleone starts an olive oil business, Genco Pura (known as simply Genco Olive Oil in the films) with his friend Genco Abbandando. The company eventually becomes the biggest olive oil importer in the nation. Over the years he uses it as a legal front for his organized crime syndicate, while amassing a fortune with his illegal operations. In 1925, he returns to Sicily for the first time since leaving 24 years earlier. He and his partner, Don Tommasino then set up a meeting with the aging Don Ciccio, where he kills him by carving his stomach open, thus avenging his murdered father, mother and brother.Organized CrimeBy the early 1930s, Vito Corleone has organized his illegal operations as the Corleone crime family. Genco Abbandando becomes his consigliere, or advisor, with Clemenza and Tessio as capo regimes. Later, his son Sonny becomes a capo as well, and eventually his under-boss. Around 1939, he moves his base of operations to Long Beach, on Long Island. While he oversees a business founded on gambling, bootlegging, and union corruption, he is known as a kind, generous man who lives by a strict moral code of loyalty to friends and, above all, family. At the same time, he is known as a traditionalist who demands respect commensurate with his status. By the time of the novel and film, even his three closest friends Genco, Pete and Salnever call him ""Vito,"" but either ""Godfather"" or ""Don Corleone."" In both the book and the first scene of the first Godfather, he chastises his old friend, undertaker Bonasera, for not coming to him first after his daughter is beaten up instead of going to the police. Although he has a reputation for ruthlessness, he disagrees with many of the vicious crimes carried out by gangs and so seeks to control crime in New York by either consuming or eliminating rival gangs. In the mid-1920s, Vito met Hyman Roth (based on real life Jewish mobster Meyer Lansky), who wanted to use Vito\'s trucks for his own smuggling operation. Vito accepted this offer, and the two became allies for many years.Assassination AttemptIn 1945, Corleone is nearly assassinated when he refuses the request of Virgil Sollozzo to invest in a heroin operation and use his political contacts for the operation\'s protection. He is supposed to be driven home by his bodyguard, Paulie Gatto (a soldier in the Clemenza regime) along with his son Fredo. When the Don finds that Paulie is not there, Fredo tells him that Paulie has called in sick that day due to a cold. The Don crosses the street to buy oranges and other fruits from a street vendor. At that time, two of Sollozzo\'s hitmen come out from the shadows with guns drawn. Realizing the situation, the Don tries to sprint back to his Alfa Romeo but he is shot five times in his thighs and arms. Fredo tries to help his father, but fumbles with his gun and can\'t get to him in time.Certain that the Don is dead, Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen and tells him to get Sonny to accept the drug deal. Hagen agrees, but warns Sollozzo that the Don\'s fanatically loyal hitman, Luca Brasi, will likely come after Sollozzo. However, Sollozzo doesn\'t tell Hagen that he helped kill Brasi earlier.Just as Hagen is released, Sollozzo finds out the Don survived. Enraged, he makes a second attempt two days later. The Don is at the French Hospital being guarded by men from Tessio\'s regime. However, Sollozzo has police Captain Mark McCluskey, who has been on the take for many years, threw Tessio\'s men in jail, leaving the Don unguarded. Unfortunately for Sollozzo and McCluskey, Michael comes to visit his father just minutes before the attack is due. Realizing that his father is in danger, Michael has a nurse help him move the Don to another room and pretends to stand guard outside the hospital with Enzo the baker.Injuries from the attack put the Don out of action for next three years. Sonny served as acting head of the family during this time. He determined that Paulie Gatto took money from Sollozzo in return for betraying the Don, and ordered him killed. He also got word that the Tattaglias had killed Luca Brasi, and ordered Tessio\'s men to kill the family\'s underboss, Bruno Tattaglia. Michael persuaded Sonny to allow him to avenge their father by killing Sollozzo and McCluskey himself.Sonny\'s death and Vito\'s returnSonny was himself assassinated, forcing Vito to resume command. He ordered all inquiries made, yet also ordered that no vengeance shall be sought. With the Don incapacitated, the other families had moved in on his business interests, as well as his labor rackets. With the Don\'s return, rival families now started reconsidering their moves.After Sonny\'s funeral and other formalities, Vito ordered Hagen to contact Emilio Barzini, the second most powerful Mafia chieftain in the country, in order to arrange a meeting of heads of all the families in America except the Chicago Outfit (considered the ""black sheep"" of the underworld). The meeting took place in the board room of a Manhattan bank whose president was a close friend of the Corleones.In that meeting, Vito renounced all vengeance regarding his son\'s death. He also said a light yes to the drug operations although he mentioned he never believed in drugs. However, he said he only accepted this for ""selfish reasons"" in order to bring back Michael from exile in Sicily.In this part he said,""But let me say this. I am a superstitious man, a ridiculous failing but I must confess it here. And so if some unlucky accident should befall my youngest son, if some police officer should accidentally shoot him, if he should hang himself while in his jail cell, if new witnesses appear to testify to his guilt, my superstition will make me feel that it was the result of the ill will still borne me by some people here. Let me go further. If my son is struck by a bolt of lightning I will blame some of the people here. If his plane show fall into the sea or his ship sink beneath the waves of the ocean, if he should catch a mortal fever, if his automobile should be struck by a train, such is my superstition that I would blame the ill will felt by people here.""RetirementAfter Michael\'s return from Sicily, Vito installed him in the family business as a learner associate. Michael learned things from his father for more than a year. After Michael\'s marriage with earlier girlfriend Kay Adams, Vito went into semi-retirement. Michael became operating head of the family, with Vito as an informal consigliere. Michael sent Hagen to Las Vegas to act as the family\'s lawyer there and lay the groundwork for a planned move of most operations there after Vito\'s death. Clemenza and Tessio requested permission to break off and form their own families after the move to Las Vegas. Michael\'s bodyguard Albert \'Al\' Neri and Rocco Lampone were chosen to be the future capo regimes of the family. Willi Cicci was also considered, but opted to go with Clemenza\'s planned family.DeathAt the end of the novel and in the movie, he dies of a heart attack while playing with his grandson Anthony in his garden. His last words in the novel are, ""Life is so beautiful."" Vito\'s funeral was a grand affair, with all the other dons, capos and consiglieres in New York attending.Vito told Michael some days before his death that Barzini would set Michael up to be killed under cover of a meeting ""to fix up things."" Barzini would use a trusted member of the Corleone family as an intermediary. At the funeral, Tessio told Michael that he\'d set up a meeting on his territory in Brooklyn, where Michael would presumably be safe. However, Michael had anticipated this and had Tessio killed. Michael then ordered his men to kill Barzini and Tattaglia (in the film, the other two family chiefs as well), thus avenging his father and brother.""']","[u'Don Michael Corleone', u'""Michael is the youngest son of Don Vito Corleone. He is the youngest brother of Sonny and Fredo, and the older brother of Connie.The Godfather: Part IMichael Corleone\'s ascension to the head of the Corleone crime family is portrayed in Puzo\'s novel and the first film.Michael initially wants nothing to do with the ""family business"", and is enrolled at Dartmouth College in search of a more Americanized life. After the United States\' entry into World War II, he enlists in the Marines against his father\'s wishes and fights in the Pacific Theatre. For his bravery, Michael is featured in Life magazine in 1944, having been awarded the Navy Cross. Michael is discharged as a Captain to recover from wounds in 1945. He later re-enters Dartmouth, where he meets his future wife, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton).When his father is nearly assassinated in 1945, he volunteers to murder the man responsible, Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo (Al Lettieri). He also proposes to kill Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), a police captain who removed his father\'s bodyguards from the hospital, presumably to set up his father to be killed. Although it is normally a hard-and-fast rule in the Mafia that law enforcement officials are not to be harmed, Michael successfully convinces his older brother Sonny (James Caan) that since McCluskey is serving as Sollozzo\'s bodyguard, he has crossed into their world and is fair game.After committing the murders, Michael flees to Sicily under the protection of Don Tommasino, a longtime friend of his father\'s, and stays in exile for two years. While in Sicily, he marries a young woman named Apollonia (Simonetta Stefanelli), but she is killed by a car bomb intended for Michael. Fabrizio, one of his bodyguards, was paid by a rival family to plant the bomb.While in Sicily, he learns that Sonny had been murdered, and he returns to New York in 1950. There, he reluctantly becomes involved in his family\'s criminal enterprises, taking over for his deceased brother as operating head of the family under Vito\'s supervision. The family\'s consigliere, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and one of the caporegimes, Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano), are somewhat skeptical of his ability, but the other capo, Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda), thinks somewhat more of him. He marries Kay a year later, promising to make the family legitimate within five years.Michael tries to buy a casino from Moe Greene (Alex Rocco) the casino is partly owned ""off the record"" by the Corleone family. He intends to move his family to Nevada. After his father\'s death in 1955, he becomes official Don of the Corleone crime family. Before his death, Vito had warned Michael that after he was gone, the head of the rival Barzini family would make an attempt on his life under the pretense of organizing a meeting in order to make peace. After Tessio inadvertently reveals that he had conspired with Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte) against him, Michael arranges the murders of Barzini and Philip Tattaglia. In the film, he also kills the other two Mafia chiefs, Carmine Cuneo, and Victor Stracci. Also targeted are Greene, Tessio, Fabrizio and Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), his brother-in-law, who plotted with Barzini to have Sonny killed. With this violent attack, Michael cements his reputation and returns the Corleone family to its position as the most powerful crime family in New York.When his sister Connie (Talia Shire) finds out that Michael had Carlo killed while he stood godfather to their baby, she flies into a rage. Michael dismisses it as hysteria, and when pressed by Kay, denies any involvement in the murder. Just minutes later, however, he meets with his capos, and Clemenza greets him as ""Don Michael."" In the film, Clemenza greets Michael as ""Don Corleone"" and kisses his hand. Unknown to Michael, Kay is watching this meeting, and realizes that Connie was telling the truth after all and that her husband has become the new Don Corleone.Parallel story: The Sicilian (novel only)Michael appears as a secondary character in Puzo\'s The Sicilian. During his two-year exile in Sicily, Michael is eager to return home to his family in New York, but is told by Clemenza that his father wants him to escort Salvatore ""Turi"" Guiliano safely back to America with him. As he learns more about the reputation and exploits of the legendary Guiliano, Michael becomes extremely intrigued to meet him, but Giuliano dies before the meeting can take place.The Godfather: Part IIBy the time of The Godfather Part II, Michael has moved to shake off his family\'s Mafia roots. Frank Pentangeli, a longtime associate of his father\'s, has taken over the family\'s operations in New York.His efforts at going legitimate prove unsuccessful, however, as his enemies keep him involved in the underworld. He begins to work out a deal with business partner and rival Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) over control of casino operations, but Roth manipulates Michael\'s brother Fredo (John Cazale) into unwittingly providing him with information used to arrange an attempt on Michael\'s life.Michael and Roth travel to Cuba to forge a partnership with Fulgencio Batista\'s regime, allowing them to conduct their operations freely. In the midst of the revolution of 1959, Michael discovers that Fredo has betrayed him.Back home, Kay reveals she has aborted their child because she does not want to bring another son of his into the world. Michael divorces Kay and severs ties with her.Following the death of their mother, Michael orders Fredo\'s murder, an act he would regret for the rest of his life.The Godfather: Part IIIBy the time of The Godfather Part III (the late 1970s) Michael has taken great steps to making the family legitimate; he is preparing to hand over his interests in gambling to the other Mafia families, setting up a charitable foundation, and is even being recognized by the Vatican for his good works. This new connection to the Church gives Michael the opportunity to purchase a controlling stake in the large property conglomerate, Immobiliare. He also begins to rekindle his relationship with Kay, as well as taking Sonny\'s illegitimate son, Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), under his wing. He finds himself pulled back into the underworld, however, when almost the entire Mafia Commission is wiped out by an assassin as Michael prepares to hand over his criminal interests. Vinnie responds to this new threat against the Family with brutal violence, publicly gunning down Michael\'s rival, Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna), who was thought to have ordered the hit on Michael. Vinnie also begins a relationship with Michael\'s daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola), a romance Michael strongly disapproves of.At the end of the film, weary of the bloody, lonely life of a Don, he retires and makes his nephew the new head of the family, on condition that he end the relationship with Mary. Realizing that powerful interests in Italian politics and business were working to prevent the family\'s takeover of Immobiliare, Michael, with Vinnie\'s assistance, once again prepares to move against his enemies. This wave of murders takes place as Michael watches his son Anthony (Franc D\'Ambrosio) perform in the opera Cavalleria Rusticana. That same night, however, Mary is inadvertently killed in an assassination attempt on Michael himself. Devastated by this loss, Michael withdraws from life and retires to Sicily, where he dies years later (1997) of a diabetic stroke, sitting alone in a lawn chair.""']","[u""Santino 'Sonny' Corleone"", u'""The eldest son of Don Vito Corleone, and older brother to Connie, Michael, and Fredo Corleone. He had a hot temper and was severely protective of his sister Connie.

Sonny was survived by a wife and 5 children""']","[u'Peter Clemenza', u'""Peter Clemenza (1890 - 1958) is a fictional character appearing in Mario Puzo\'s novel The Godfather and two of the three films based on it.In his young adulthood, in The Godfather Part II, Clemenza is portrayed by Bruno Kirby. In his later years, he is portrayed by Richard S. Castellano.Peter Clemenza is one of two (later three) caporegimes in the Corleone Family (the other being Salvatore Tessio). He rules over the family\'s territory in The Bronx. Although he is less intelligent than his friend and counterpart Tessio, he is said to be more brutal and direct in the book. In the film, he may be perceived at first as a fat, dim witted thug, but later on he is shown to be a formidable assassin.Clemenza became a friend of Vito Corleone after immigrating from Sicily, when Corleone held a package of guns for him to prevent their discovery by the police. Although he is a native of Italy, and in The Godfather II is shown speaking perfect colloquial Italian as a young man in his 20s, in The Godfather an older Clemenza speaks with a highly pronounced New York/Brooklyn accent. One of the few remaining hints of his Italian roots is that he pronounces ""Corleone"" as ""Cor-yon-nay.""A friendly and jovial man, he was known as a storyteller among many of his acquaintances and family members - a trait that endeared him to Vito Corleone, whom Puzo described as ""a listener to storytellers."" Clemenza got his start selling stolen goods such as dresses and guns with Vito and Tessio as far back as 1917 and became a key figure in the growing Corleone family.Vito kept him close through the years. For instance, Vito makes Clemenza godfather to his oldest son Sonny, and handled Sonny\'s training once Sonny decided to join his father\'s family. However, this was to control his brutal and more ambitious tendencies (even though he had mellowed somewhat in a decade of peace between the families).Clemenza plays a key role in aiding Michael following the shooting of Vito. He retrains Michael how to fire a gun, walking him through the scenario for assassinating Virgil Sollozzo, and gets someone to plant the gun prior to the assassination. In the wave of killings that cements Michael\'s power, Clemenza garroted Carlo Rizzi for his role in setting up Sonny for assassination. During the murders of the heads of the Five Families in the film, Clemenza personally shot Don Stracci and his bodyguard. It is Clemenza\'s greeting of Michael as ""Don Michael"" at the end of the book (as ""Don Corleone"" at the end of the film) that convinces Kay Adams-Corleone that her husband has become as ruthless as his father.Clemenza\'s forces include soldiers Paulie Gatto, Willi Cicci, Al Neri, Rocco Lampone and Aldo Trapani. He handled many of his men closely, proud of picking Lampone as a caporegime and locating Neri as a successor to Luca Brasi. He could also be cruel with them - when he found out that Gatto had been collaborating with Sollozo, he saw it as a personal betrayal and orchestrated the execution personally, with Rocco pulling the trigger.Ironically, clemenza literally means ""mercy"" or ""forgiveness"" in Italian. The English cognate is clemency.In Mark Winegardner\'s novel The Godfather Returns, Clemenza stands in as consigliere at Commission meetings during the course of the book (since Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere and he is also not Sicilian, so hecannot be involved in these meetings.) He died of a heart attack shortly before 1958, a consequence of his excessive lifestyle - an autopsy revealed his heart was ""twice the size of a normal man\'s."" In the film The Godfather: Part II, Willie Cicci, appears to deny this, stating ""that was no heart attack"" but no further info is given. Pete Clemenza was succeeded as caporegime by Frank Pentangeli.In Puzo\'s novel The Sicilian, Clemenza is featured in Sicily, where he meets Michael Corleone in order to arrange his safe return to America and also to oversee the safe passage of the novel\'s lead character, Salvatore Guiliano. In this novel he has an older brother, Domenic Clemenza, who is an old-fashioned and well respected Mafia Don. Neither Clemenza nor Michael Corleone are featured in the film version of the novel, presumably because of copyright restrictions on the Godfather film franchise.Clemenza was originally supposed to return in The Godfather Part II. However, Castellano demanded that he write all of Clemenza\'s lines himself, along with a large salary increase.[citation needed] Director Francis Ford Coppola refused and had Clemenza killed instead, replacing him with Frank Pentangeli.Richard S. Castellano and Bruno Kirby appeared together in a television series entitled The Super, in which they played a father and son.""']","[[<bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nRather than concentrating on everything that is great about The\nGodfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is\nbad about it.

From the direction, to the\nacting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic\nwritten all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now\nconsidered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it\ncomes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary\nas\nCitizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a\nmovie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for\n""gangster movies"", but its influence goes well beyond that.<br><br>The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements\nof\nit can be found in virtually every ""organized crime film"" nowadays; almost\nevery comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed\nsomething in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito\nCorleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's\nimagination.<br><br>But to say that The Godfather is simply ""influential"" is to diminish its\ntrue qualities, and so is to describe it simply as ""a movie about\ngangsters"". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves\naround\n(despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the\nmovie\nnever tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of\npsychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked.\nConsiderations\non how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear\ndifferent from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a\nhuman\nsoul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a\nstory that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the\nresult\nis a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.<br><br>As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to\nconsider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic\ntriumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever\nappear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in\nportraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a\nslip.\nThe exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively\nby\nMarlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan\nand Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the\nruthless\nVirgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other\nroles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us\nbelieve these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a\ncentral character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around\nhim:\nalthough Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time,\neverybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it\npossible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to\nobserve how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more\neffectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in\nthe\nlast few years.<br><br>The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie\n(Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the\nuse of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his\nlife. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's\npower extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely\npopular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless\nkiller,\nDon Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him\nback. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence\nand\nintuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.<br><br>However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger\npeople\nworking in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete.\nThe Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too\ndangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up\nself-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a\nlong time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close\none\neye. Drugs are another thing.<br><br>To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while\nmaintaining\nhis economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a\npowerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don\nCorleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by\nthe latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see\nMichael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take\npart in the family business, lose his ""innocence"" and transform into a\ngangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up\nagainst.<br><br>I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe\nthat\nthe film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and --\nbelieve it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never\nseen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an\nincredible tension, various twists, and although like any other\nmasterpiece\nThe Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still\nbe\na phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for\nthe\nfirst time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such\ncomplicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short\nreview like this one would be inadmissible.<br><br>There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel\nwritten by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an expos\xe9\nof\ntrue facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for\ninstance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other\ncharacters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly,\nI\nhave no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra\nreference seems obviously quite believable.<br><br>The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are\nused perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a\nfair\namount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.<br><br>The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is\nuniversally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances\nby\nPacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.\n\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\n     This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and\nover the top directing.

Initially, I didn't like\nthis film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This\nwas until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for\nthis sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read)\nevery last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I\ngrew a true appreciation for this epic.<br><br>To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients\nworking in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across\nthis, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters:\nGood films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat\nbecause the core of each character is the same.<br><br>Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want\nmono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish\ncontrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes\nfilms deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the\nDon's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas\nSonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply\nhaving these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do\nis to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then\ndwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in.\nThe Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many\ntry to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character\nobscurities that stretch credibility.<br><br>2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a\ntransformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the\nend of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's\ncharacter must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must\nalso have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the\nwedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film.\nAgain, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal\n(literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall\nStreet).<br><br>3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple\nreason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was\nnot much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the\nnew goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.<br><br>All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family\nlife, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the\nkey (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with\nWolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While\nstudios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it\nif you have a ripper story to base it on.<br><br>I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous\nre-watch-ability.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nThe Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. \n Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie\n experiences of my life.

The first time I\nviewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most\nastounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my\nall-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking\nforward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let's\nstart from the beginning. The film opens to four words, 'I believe in\nAmerica', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a\nresonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the\nfilm's ""threshold"". This is just one of the many renowned quotes that\nlitter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take\nwe are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly\nportrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is a\nfeared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is a\nrespected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellent\nactors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted\nchild Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as he\nattempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael.\nWith some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever\nbeen seen in the 1970's film industry (including a certain horse's\nhead), 'The Godfather' epitomises how violence can be used effectively\nwithin a film. The Corleone's are some of the greatest antiheroes to\nhave ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience\nwill refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and\naudacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with\nbeautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced\naction and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood's greatest\ncritical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a\ngangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and\nsubtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis\nFord Coppola. Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever\nbeen made.\n</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><a href=""reviews-enter"">Add another review</a></p>>], [<bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nMarlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful\nNew York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by\ndirector/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is\nreceiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his\ndaughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place.\nThe epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito,\nhis family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom\nHagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with\nother mob syndicates.<br><br>The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films\nof all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same\nkind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films\n10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I\nthink it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for\ntranscending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any\nrate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's\nso highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think\nit's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly\nloved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that\nliteracy.<br><br>Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and\nsoap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a\nnovel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola.\nThere is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be\ndifficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've\nwatched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem\nto spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is\nthat guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive\nor negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic\nstories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one\nto make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather\nis concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family\nas they try to make it through life--including marriages, births,\nadultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their\ncommunity, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts\nfor much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus\nfrom the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the\nfilm a 10.<br><br>But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even\nthough the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality\nin the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually\ngives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I\njust watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather\nagain, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in\ncomparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting\nthat knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the\ntop that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.<br><br>To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone\nfamily, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole\nfilm can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating""\ndynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being\ninteracting/distancing, control/lack of control,\nbenevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some\ncombination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances\naround the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle,\neven the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of\nthat stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing\ncharacters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that\nunderlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving\n(a dynamic) equilibrium.<br><br>But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my\nscore up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their\ngrandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go\nwrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert\nDuvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned\nelement that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create\natmosphere is Nino Rota's score.<br><br>Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by\nGordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle\nas to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening,\nfor example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out""\nfrom Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully\nlit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro\neffect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from\na minor character).<br><br>Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame\nto create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly\nthat at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought\nabout, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see\ndelightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on,\nall created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.<br><br>If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you\ncan do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of\nall time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could\nnever be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it\nas one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but\nrelatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very\nwell known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical\nfamily saga"" as a crime or gangster film.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nEngrossing motion picture that features some of\nthe finest editing, cinematography and performances\never.

His\nperformance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and\nrealistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine\nthan Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as\nwell. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about\ndepth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own\ninner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his\nfamily, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological\ncharacter study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the\nglue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in\njust that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His\ncharacter is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was\nlistened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film\ngreat balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the\ncake.<br><br>The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there\nhas been no movie quoted more than this.

The direction is flawless. The\nacting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie I've ever\nseen or will ever see. It's also one of the most precise and intricate\nfilms I've ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of\nthe most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever\ncaptured on film. Watching ""The Godfather,"" is like watching cinematic\nart. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is what brings this film, that's\nso ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he\nhandles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a\nblack screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man\nstarts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled\nright in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs\nfor justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don\nCorleone (Marlon Brando) for justice. Don Vito is the man of power.\nHe's the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance\nfrom behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think.\nSome of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show\nthe distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito\ncrying over his son, Sonny's (James Caan), death. When Michael learns\nof the news, he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally\npowerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has\ndied long before he should have, and they come from Brando. As Vito\nstands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash\nof feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but\ncompared. <br><br>The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito' daughter, Connie (Talia\nShire), and we see just how strong the bond of family really is. You\nhave the family dancing with each other, drinking, laughing, and\nsitting next to each other to show how close they are, then we see some\nof the outsiders such as the Barzini family, and surprisingly Michael\n(Al Pacino) along with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) on the\noutskirts without much interaction. Michael seems almost out of place\nas if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is more apart\nof the family than he is. His opening words are to Kay, and they\ninclude, ""That's my family, Kay. That's not me."" <br><br>We get the feeling that Michael's nearly ashamed of the stigma that\ngoes along with his last name: This is what makes Al Pacino' role-\nsignificantly- the hardest performance in the entire film to portray.\nHe's the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider\nand completely against the family's actions and businesses to, by films\nend, head of the family. Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors\nlive for, but Michael is too cold for that. Never for a second as he\ngradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or\nlaughable, and in lesser hands it very easily could have been. <br><br>The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are\nmade left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally\ncaptivating. As the film draws to an end, Michael has gained half of\nthe power of the family and makes most of the decisions. He's treated,\nnot with respect, but as an outsider, too high ranking for his\nexperience. The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing\neverything, yet we never get that feeling. We see the two leader's\nconfidence and we keep our confidence in them, even if the other family\nmembers doubt their decisions. Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe\nGreene an offer he can't refuse. Then he refuses. This is Pacino'\nshinning moment in the film. There's no screaming or the hoopla that\ngoes along with his name. After he treats Moe Greene like utter\ngarbage, Fredo (John Cazale) get's upset and starts barking at him.\nCoppola is perfectly on his game here, too, as we watch from Fredo's\nheight, looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks\nup with his radiating eyes, that have so much going on behind them, and\nsimply says, ""Fredo, don't ever take sides with anyone against family\nagain. Ever.""<br><br>That's some serious foreshadowing for the second film, and only after\nwatching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and\nCoppola pulled off in this scene; Cazale too. We have no idea how\nserious Michael is. These are some of the stepping stones that make\nMichael's change believable. He's not quite his father- Vito has a soft\nspot for his children (admittedly so)- as he's capable of turning on\nanyone and using the line, ""It's strictly business"" when it comes to\nfamily issues. Michael's sister, Connie, calls him a ""cold hearted\nbastard"" at the end of the film. It's hard to find better superlatives\nthan that, yet we still love him. The interesting thing about Pacino'\nperformance is that he doesn't sugarcoat it. He doesn't try to make the\naudience love him. He plays the character as the character should be\nplayed. That's the sign of great writing; great acting; and great\ndirecting since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him\nlikable. This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and\nlet's us decide if we love him or hate him. Its films like ""The\nGodfather,"" that made me wish I had amnesia, so I could feel the same\nheart pounding moments over and over again.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nBefore 'The Godfather' came out in 1972, the gangster genre, chiefly\nassociated with Jimmy Cagney and the film noir style of the forties and\nfifties, had been in something of a decline. It was, therefore, a brave\nmove for Francis Ford Coppola to attempt a three-hour epic based upon\nthe family life of a Mafia don. <br><br>The film opens in the immediate post-war period with the wedding of the\ndaughter of Don Vito Corleone. Scenes of the wedding are intercut with\nscenes showing Don Vito himself in his study, granting favours and\ndispensing a crude form of justice as though he were an absolute\nmonarch. We soon learn, however, that times are changing, even in the\nworld of organised crime. Don Vito's empire has been based upon\ngambling, illicit liquor sales and prostitution. Other Mafia families,\nhowever, are eager for the profits to be made from drugs, and Corleone\nreceives a proposal from a drug dealer named Sollozzo that the Corleone\nclan should join him in exploiting the narcotics market. Corleone\nrefuses, ostensibly for business reasons, but it is made clear that his\nreal objections to narcotics derive from his personal code of honour.\nSollozzo, offended, orders an attempt to be made on Corleone's life.\nThis fails, but Corleone is left seriously injured.<br><br>The focus now shifts to the younger generation. Don Vito has three\nsons, Santino ('Sonny'), Fredo and Michael, and an adopted son, Tom\nHagen. These four have contrasting characters. Sonny is hot-headed and\nimpetuous, Fredo weak, Tom cautious and moderate. Michael, the\nyoungest, loves his family, but initially wants to play no part in\ntheir criminal enterprises. Recently returned from the war, his\nambitions are to qualify as a lawyer and to settle down in a\nrespectable life with his Anglo-Saxon wife-to-be, Kay. The attempt on\nhis father's life, however, persuades Michael that his first loyalty is\nto the family, and he agrees to be part of a revenge attack on Sollozzo\nand Captain McCluskey the corrupt policeman who is on his payroll.\nThere follows a brutal cycle of revenge, as each killing is avenged by\nanother murder. <br><br>The film's emphasis on family ties, honour and vengeance recall the\nrevengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre. Coppola\ndoes seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur. Don Vito, the\nageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear,\nMichael, a good man corrupted by power, of Macbeth (a comparison which\nwill become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy). There\nis also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge\ntheir father. Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high\norder if it is to seem credible, but Coppola was able to draw upon some\nof the best performances of the seventies. To my mind, this was Marlon\nBrando's last great role (I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now'\nand loathed 'Last Tango in Paris'), but it was one that he made the\nmost of. His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable, part dictator\nand part lonely old man. His rasping voice (the result of an earlier\nbullet wound in the throat) conveys both menace and physical weakness.\nDon Vito may be a bad man, but he is also in a way a magnificent one,\nand his passing marks the end of an era. <br><br>If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando, it also saw\nthe birth of a new star. Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II', I\nhave never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here,\nas he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' (as his brother\ncalls him) to a warlord, from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless\nkiller. Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen, I am\nsurprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather\nthan Best Actor. It would be interesting to speculate who might have\nwon if he and Brando had been in competition for the award. I am even\nmore surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor; Joel\nGrey's role in 'Cabaret' (which did win) is more showy and a technical\ntour de force, but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's\nperformance. I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hot-headed\nSonny. <br><br>This is not a perfect film; it has flaws, both artistic and ethical.\nArtistically, there are places where it tends to drag, particularly\nafter the killings of Sollozzo and McCluskey, and even more so after\nthe killing of Sonny, although it recovers at the ending, which is a\nhighly effective piece of cinema. <br><br>Ethically, I felt that the film tended to take the characters' world\nview too much at face value. Don Vito may be a dictator, but he is in\nhis own eyes a benevolent dictator, a man of honour who lives by his\nown moral code. As others such as Roger Ebert have pointed out, this is\na film which views a closed society from the inside; the only outsider\nis Kay, and her role is a relatively minor one. As a result, we do not\nget to see the damage that organised crime does to the fabric of\nsociety, and the Mafia's own view of itself is never openly challenged.\nThat is not to say, however, that the film is totally amoral. We do see\nthat an ethos of taking revenge can spiral out of control and lead to\nunforeseen consequences, to the innocent as well as the guilty. This is\nparticularly true of the scenes where Michael takes refuge in Sicily\nafter killing Sollozzo. The dead man's associates track him down, and a\nbomb meant for him instead kills his innocent young Italian wife\nApollonia. <br><br>Although there may be no overt condemnation of the moral position of\nthe Mafia, there is implied criticism of its bloodier deeds. All the\ncharacters, whatever the crimes of which they may be guilty, are\ncareful to pay lip-service to the Catholic Church and its rituals.\nThroughout the film (indeed, throughout the trilogy as a whole) the\ntraditional ceremonies of the Church form a backdrop to various\ncriminal activities. ('The Godfather' begins with a wedding and ends\nwith a baptism). It seemed to me that Coppola was using these scenes to\nmake an ironic contrast between the values of organised crime and those\nof Christianity, especially at the end of the film. Michael, already a\n'godfather' in the metaphorical sense of a Mafia boss, becomes one in\nthe literal sense of a baptismal sponsor. Shots of him taking vows on\nbehalf of his godchild to reject the works of the devil are intercut\nwith shots of his enemies being gunned down on his orders.<br><br>Despite my reservations about this film, and although I personally\nwould not have ranked it as my all-time favourite, there can be no\ndenying that it is a film of great power and a milestone in the history\nof the cinema. 8/10\n\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nMichael Corleone returns home from the war for his sister's wedding. \nHowever his return coincides with the beginnings of a war between the main\nfamilies sparked by the marketing of drugs.

When Michael's brother Sonny is murdered,\nMichael returns home to take control of the family and clear up the\nwar.<br><br>The most famous and the best film about organised crime is also one of the\nbest films ever made.  The plot is at once straightforward and complex, it\ndeals with things on many levels from the action to the theme of family. \nThe basic story is gripping and sprawling at the same time.  It creates many\nmemorable scenes and lines that have become part of the general knowledge\nthat we all share \x96 that's why it's referred to in everything from Sopranos\ndown to The Simpsons.<br><br>Every shot is perfectly framed and has a great sense of period throughout. \nFrom the opening speech with it's memorable lines and camera focus down to\nthe final shot and all it implies, it is full throughout.  The action is a\npleasure to watch and the lines are so much more classy than more recent\nattempts at gangster films.<br><br>Pacino is great \x96 he not only changes before our eyes over the 3 hours but\nhe manages it into the next film too.  Brando is always a risk on any film,\nand when he started mumbling and filling his cheeks with cotton wool,\nCoppola must have worried about what was happening, but he delivers a\nperformance that is so good that almost everyone has impersonated him at\nsome time.  The main cast is full of good performances from actors from all\nstages.  Up and comers such as Duvall, Caan, Keaton etc are as good as more\nageing icons such as Richard Conte, Sterling Haydn, Castellano\netc.<br><br>In every area the film oozes class and professionalism.  The look at family\nlife is excellent and the only downside is that it can't help but glamorise\norganised crime \x96 people may be killed but it still looks and sounds cool. \nBut then, if we're going to start criticising films because they glamorise\nviolence or destruction then The Godfather comes along way down the hit list\n\x96 long after countless hundreds of action movies and summer\nblockbusters.<br><br>Overall this film will always be a classic, your Harry Potters, Star Wars,\nLord of the Rings etc will come and go based on how well hyped they are \x96\nbut Godfather has been on most people's top 5 list for decades and will to\ncontinue to be for many more.

It's\nwell-done and I would have printed a review on that version, but I\ndon't see it listed on IMDb.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nSpoilers Ahead;<br><br>I am not a big fan of the sequels even the second is a big step down\nfrom this one. What a cast? Like an earlier reviewer said;\nREWATCHABLE!! Yes, I am Italian, not a Sicilian, and I have seen it\nhundreds of times. What a cast: Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall. Even the\nsupporting cast is excellent with the film noir legend Richard Conte as\nBarzini. Puzo wrote such a rich, deep script. The characters suck you\nin and are so lifelike. Each brother is radically different from the\nother. Fredo, the mama's boy, the useless one who Michael kills off in\nthe second one. Sonny, the human volcano, with a temper that has to be\nseen to be believed. Michael, the quiet and deadly one most like Vito\nbut colder more ruthless. Michael was always outside the family looking\nin; he was held in contempt by the rest as the soft college boy who\ndidn't want to get his hands dirty. This is the answer to the riddle of\nhow he could kill Fredo, his own brother, later in the second one.\nNotice where he sits at the wedding, as far away from the family as he\ncan get.<br><br>Events suck Michael into their world but he never is really in the\nfamily. We see his cruelty by the end of the movie as he slaughters the\nheads of the five families and his own sister's husband Carlo who\nfingered Sonny. The key scene for understanding Michael is the baby's\nbaptism; watch the juxtaposition of the images with the words the\npriest is saying. As he renounces Satan he performs the very actions he\nis renouncing. Coppola was so good at using images to contradict words;\nit is really his signature. Pacino becomes the very image of Satan as\nhe murders all those people while standing reciting the holy words of\nbaptism renouncing the very deeds as he is performing them. What a work\nof art!! Only Francis Coppola could do this. <br><br>The film, to be fair to its critics, does gloss over the mafia a bit.\nWe do not see old store owners shaken down with blow torches waved in\nfront of their faces. I do think Puzo and Coppola do show the awful\ncost of the evil. Even here, Michael slowly transforms from a diffident\noutcast at the back of the family to a ruthless Don. It appears here\nthat he is like Vito but that illusion is dispelled by his ruthlessness\nfar exceeding Vito's. Michael because he was an outcast simply does not\nfeel the bonds of family as Vito did. There is a coldness about him; he\nis like an iceberg. The movie is three hours long but it moves very\nquickly. The only parts that drag are the scenes of michael's exile in\nSicily. It really is the story of the brothers and how radically\ndifferent their fates are; Fredo is sent to Vegas where he becomes a\nweakling fop beaten up by Moe Greene, Sonny's temper ends up killing\nhim like you always knew it would. Michael gets sucked in; there is\nalways great resentment in Michael for the destiny he never wanted.<br><br>The second film shows Michael's estrangement from the family deepening.\nIt culminates in him killing Fredo for putting him at risk. I always\nthink it is important to see Michael as Puzo and Coppola paint him: a\nloner who protects himself ruthlessly. He really could care less about\nthe family; he is all about power and control. Vito, for all his evil,\ncared and loved his family very deeply. Look, Fredo almost got him\nkilled when Sollozo's men attacked, he fumbled and dropped his gun.\nVito did not kill him; Michael was not so forgiving. It is a true\nmasterpiece. I LOVE IT\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nThis film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its\nattention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful\nscreenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline\nwhich became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the\nperformances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire\ncast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is\nthe fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for\nthe roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their\nrespective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor\nactress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone\n(including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or\n""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and\nthis is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still\ncontinues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of\nthe classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and\nwill probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather\nSaga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which\nis absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with\nthe eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not\nlike this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.\n</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><a href=""reviews-enter"">Add another review</a></p>>]]"

His parents, Rose (Gerardi) and Sal Pacino, divorced when he was young. His mother moved them into his grandparents\' house. Pacino found himself often repeating the plots and voices of characters he had seen in the movies, one of his favorite activities. Bored and unmotivated in school, the young Al Pacino found a haven in school plays, and his interest soon blossomed into a full-time career. Starting on the stage, he went through a lengthy period of depression and poverty, sometimes having to borrow bus fare to make it to auditions. He made it into the prestigious Actors Studio in 1966, studying under legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg, creator of the Method Approach that would become the trademark of many 1970s-era actors.After appearing in a string of plays in supporting roles, Pacino finally succeeded with ""The Indian Wants the Bronx"", winning an Obie Award for the 1966-67 season. That was followed by a Tony Award for ""Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?"". His first feature films made little departure from the gritty realistic stage performances that earned him respect: he played a drug addict in The Panic in Needle Park (1971) after his film debut in Me, Natalie (1969). What came next would change his life forever. The role of Michael Corleone in The Godfather (1972) was one of the most sought-after of the time: Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Ryan O\'Neal, Robert De Niro and a host of others either wanted it or were mentioned for it, but director Francis Ford Coppola had his heart set on the unknown Italian Pacino for the role, although pretty much everyone else--from the studio to the producers to some of the cast members--did not want him.Though Coppola won out through slick persuasion, Pacino was in constant fear of being fired during the hellish shoot. Much to his (and Coppola\'s) relief, the film was a monster hit that did wonders for everyone\'s career, including Pacino\'s, and earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. However, instead of taking on easier projects for the big money he could now command, Pacino threw his support behind what he considered tough but important films, such as the true-life crime drama Serpico (1973) and the tragic real-life bank robbery film Dog Day Afternoon (1975). He opened eyes around the film world for his brave choice of roles, and he was nominated three consecutive years for the ""Best Actor"" Academy Award. He faltered slightly with Bobby Deerfield (1977), but regained his stride with ...and justice for all. (1979), for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Unfortunately, this would signal the beginning of a decline in his career, which produced such critical and commercial flops as Cruising (1980) and Author! Author! (1982).Pacino took on another vicious gangster role and cemented his legendary status in the ultra-violent cult film Scarface (1983), but a monumental mistake was about to follow. Revolution (1985) endured an endless and seemingly cursed shoot in which equipment was destroyed, weather was terrible, and Pacino became terribly sick with pneumonia. Constant changes in the script also further derailed a project that seemed doomed from the start anyway. The Revolutionary War film is considered one of the worst films ever, not to mention one of the worst of his career, resulted in his first truly awful reviews and kept him off the screen for the next four years. Returning to the stage, Pacino has done much to give back and contribute to the theatre, which he considers his first love. He directed a film, The Local Stigmatic (1990), but it remains unreleased. He lifted his self-imposed exile with the striking Sea of Love (1989) as a hard-drinking policeman. This marked the second phase of Pacino\'s career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice.Returning to the Corleones, Pacino made The Godfather: Part III (1990) and earned raves for his first comedic role in the colorful adaptation Dick Tracy (1990). This earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and two years later he was nominated for Glengarry Glen Ross (1992). He went into romantic mode for Frankie and Johnny (1991). In 1992, he finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his amazing performance in Scent of a Woman (1992). A mixture of technical perfection (he plays a blind man) and charisma, the role was tailor-made for him, and remains a classic. The next few years would see Pacino becoming more comfortable with acting and movies as a business, turning out great roles in great films with more frequency and less of the demanding personal involvement of his wilder days. Carlito\'s Way (1993) proved another gangster classic, as did the epic crime drama Heat (1995) directed by Michael Mann and co-starring Robert De Niro, although they only had a few scenes together. He returned to the director\'s chair for the highly acclaimed and quirky Shakespeare adaptation Looking for Richard (1996). City Hall (1996), Donnie Brasco (1997) and The Devil\'s Advocate (1997) all came out in this period. Reteaming with Mann and then Oliver Stone, he gave two commanding performances in The Insider (1999) and Any Given Sunday (1999).In the 2000s, Pacino starred in a number of theatrical blockbusters, including Ocean\'s Thirteen (2007), but his choice in television roles (the vicious Roy Cohn in the HBO miniseries Angels in America (2003) and his sensitive portrayal of Jack Kevorkian, in the television movie You Don\'t Know Jack (2010)) are reminiscent of the bolder choices of his early career. Each television project garnered him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.In his personal life, Pacino is one of Hollywood\'s most enduring and notorious bachelors, having never been married. He has a daughter, Julie Marie, with acting teacher Jan Tarrant, and a new set of twins with longtime girlfriend Beverly D\'Angelo. His romantic history includes a long-time romance with ""Godfather"" co-star Diane Keaton. With his intense and gritty performances, Pacino was an original in the acting profession. His Method approach would become the process of many actors throughout time, and his unbeatable number of classic roles has already made him a legend among film buffs and all aspiring actors and directors. His commitment to acting as a profession and his constant screen dominance has established him as one of the movies\' true legends.Pacino has never abandoned his love for the theater, and Shakespeare in particular, having directed the Shakespeare adaptation Looking for Richard (1996) and played Shylock in The Merchant of Venice (2004).- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Pedro Borges          Trade Mark (5)        Volcanic tirade, smoke-burnished voice        Frequently plays men of power and/or authority        Surly but essentially moral characters with deep capacity for violence        Jet black hair and dark owl eyes        Diminutive frame, off-set by his formidable bearingTrivia (99)      Ranked #4 in Empire (UK) magazine\'s ""The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time"" list.

He was rejected repeatedly by studio heads while auditioning for the role of Michael Corleone in The Godfather (1972), but Francis Ford Coppola fought for him. This film was shot briskly because both the director and the leading actor were in constant fear of being fired. Ironically, this turned out to be a breakthrough for both.      Is the stepson of actress and make-up artist Katherin Kovin-Pacino.      Has four sisters: Josette, a teacher, twins Roberta Pacino and Paula, and a younger sister named Desiree, whom Pacino\'s father adopted whilst married to his fourth wife.

Wheeler also directed Pacino in Heathcote Williams\' ""The Local Stigmatic"" for Joseph Papp\'s Public Theater in New York City in 1976. Pacino appeared in a 1989 film of ""Stigmatic"" (The Local Stigmatic (1990)) directed by Wheeler that was presented at the Cin\xe9math\xe8que in Los Angeles.

His performance in the Broadway play ""Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?"" won him a Tony Award for Best Dramatic Supporting Actor, and a Drama Desk Award and Theatre World Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1969.      While Paramount brass dithered over whether to cast him as Michael Corleone in The Godfather (1972), the role that would make him a star, a frustrated Pacino signed up for the role of Mario Trantino in The Gang That Couldn\'t Shoot Straight (1971). When Paramount finally decided to offer him the role in ""The Godfather"", this had to buy him out of his contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Ironically, the role went to Robert De Niro, whom The Godfather: Part II (1974) would make a star.      His favorite actress is Julie Christie.      He and Jamie Foxx are two out of the only three actors to be nominated for an Academy Award for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor in the same year. (Barry Fitzgerald did it first in 1945) Pacino was nominated in 1993 for Scent of a Woman (1992) and Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) / Foxx in 2005 for Ray (2004) and Collateral (2004). Both men won the Best Actor award, and they both played blind men in their roles: Pacino as Frank Slade and Foxx as Ray Charles.

Turned down the role of Richard Sherman for a remake of The Seven Year Itch (1955) which was never filmed.      Turned down the role of Michael Corleone in the Godfather videogame.      His performance as Sonny Wortzik in Dog Day Afternoon (1975) is ranked #4 on Premiere magazine\'s 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006).      His performance as Michael Corleone in The Godfather: Part II (1974) is ranked #20 on Premiere magazine\'s 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006).      His performance as Tony Montana in Scarface (1983) is ranked #74 on Premiere magazine\'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.      His performance as Michael Corleone in The Godfather: Part II (1974) is ranked #11 on the American Film Institute\'s 100 Heroes & Villains.      His performance as Frank Serpico in Serpico (1973) is ranked #40 on the American Film Institute\'s 100 Heroes & Villains.      Was director Bryan Singer\'s first choice for the role of Dave Kujan in The Usual Suspects (1995). Pacino passed on the role and has since stated that that is the role he regrets passing on the most.      Imprinted his hands and signature in cement at Grauman\'s Chinese Theatre on November 16, 1997.      Stated in an interview that the movie he most wanted to be in but could not get the role was Slap Shot (1977). Director George Roy Hill opted not to go with Pacino because he could not ice skate.      Revealed to James Lipton on Inside the Actors Studio (1994) for the first time ever that his maternal grandfather was born in Corleone, Sicily.      Resided with Jill Clayburgh (1970-1975).      At one point, David Cronenberg was in line to direct the film The Singing Detective (2003), with Pacino in the lead.      Over the ending credits of A Cock and Bull Story (2005) the two stars, Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon compete at doing Pacino impressions.      Oscar-winning director John Schlesinger envisioned a cast of Pacino, Julie Christie and Laurence Olivier for Marathon Man (1976). Pacino has said that the only actress he had ever wanted to work with was Christie, who he claimed was ""the most poetic of actresses"". Producer Robert Evans, who disparaged the vertically challenged Pacino as ""The Midget"" when Francis Ford Coppola wanted him for The Godfather (1972) and had thought of firing him during the early shooting of the now-classic film, vetoed Pacino for the lead. Instead, Evans insisted on the casting of the even shorter Dustin Hoffman! On her part, Christie -- who was notoriously finicky about accepting roles, even in prestigious, sure-fire material -- turned down the female lead, which was then taken by Marthe Keller (who, ironically, became Pacino\'s lover after co-starring with him in Bobby Deerfield (1977)). Of his dream cast, Schlesinger only got Olivier, who was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Pacino has yet to co-star with Christie.      Has suffered from chronic insomnia.      His Oscar nomination for The Godfather (1972) marked his first of four consecutive nominations, a feat he shares with Jennifer Jones (1943-1946), Thelma Ritter (1950-1953), Marlon Brando (1951-1954) and Elizabeth Taylor (1957-1960).      Has been friends with HRH Prince Charles, The Prince of Wales, for several years, and has stayed as his guest at Highgrove House.      He studied acting at HB Studio in Greenwich Village, New York City.      Former New York deputy mayor Ken Lipper was one of Pacino\'s classmates in school.      When asked by the AFI, he named L\'albero degli zoccoli (1978) and Singin\' in the Rain (1952) as his favorite films.      Got co-star Kevin Spacey his first major role in a film. Pacino saw Spacey performing on Broadway and suggested him to the director of Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) for the role of John Williamson.      Is a huge fan of Dick Van Dyke.      Lifetime member of the prestigious Actors Studio. He was accepted into the studio in 1966, studying under legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg.      The voice of Moe the Bartender from The Simpsons (1989) was based on Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon (1975).      Resides in Beverly Hills, California and Palisades, New York.      Spoke three of the American Film Institute\'s 100 Movie Quotes: ""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."" from The Godfather: Part II (1974) at #58, ""Say \'hello\' to my little friend!"" from Scarface (1983) at #61 and ""Attica! Attica!"" from Dog Day Afternoon (1975) at #86.      Before becoming a professional actor he held a number of jobs including a messenger, shoe salesman, supermarket checker, shoe shiner, furniture mover, office boy, fresh-fruit polisher, and a newsboy.      He was awarded the 2011 American National Medal of the Arts for his services to drama on February 13, 2012 at the White House in Washington, D.C.      Starred as King Herod in Oscar Wilde\'s ""Salom\xe9"" on Broadway in 1992 opposite Sheryl Lee (directed by Robert Allan Ackerman), and in 2003 opposite Marisa Tomei (directed by Estelle Parsons). He reprised the role opposite Jessica Chastain in 2006 in Los Angeles and in the documentary-drama film Wilde Salom\xe9 (2011) that he also wrote and directed.      Is one of nine actors to have won the Triple Crown of Acting (an Oscar, Emmy and Tony); the others in chronological order are Thomas Mitchell, Melvyn Douglas, Paul Scofield, Jack Albertson, Jason Robards, Jeremy Irons, Geoffrey Rush and Christopher Plummer.      Is one of the few Razzie Award winners to have won an acting award for playing himself. He won Worst Supporting Actor for Jack and Jill (2011).      Became a father for the first time at age 49 when his [now ex] partner Jan Tarrant gave birth to their daughter Julie Marie Pacino, aka Julie Pacino, on October 16, 1989.      Became a father for the second and third time at age 60 when his [now ex] partner Beverly D\'Angelo gave birth to their twins Anton and Olivia Pacino on January 25, 2001.      During the early 1980s, Pacino tried unsuccessfully to develop a biographical film on Amedeo Modigliani.      Claims to have learned more about acting from friend John Cazale than from anybody else.      As of 2014, has appeared in six films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: The Godfather (1972), The Godfather: Part II (1974), Dog Day Afternoon (1975), The Godfather: Part III (1990), Scent of a Woman (1992) and The Insider (1999). Of those, The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather: Part II (1974) are winners in the category.      Has great respect for many of his peers including Robert De Niro, Johnny Depp and Sean Penn.      Although he played Morgana King and Marlon Brando\'s son in The Godfather (1972), he is only ten and sixteen years their junior respectively.      Along with Barry Fitzgerald and Sylvester Stallone, he is one of only three actors to receive Oscar nominations for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor for playing the same character: (1) Fitzgerald was nominated for both awards for playing Father Fitzgibbon in Going My Way (1944), (2) Pacino was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for playing Michael Corleone The Godfather (1972) and Best Actor for the same role in The Godfather: Part II (1974) and (3) Stallone was nominated for Best Actor for playing Rocky Balboa in Rocky (1976) and Best Supporting Actor for the same role in Creed (2015).      Has worked with seven directors who have won a Best Director Oscar: Francis Ford Coppola, Sydney Pollack, William Friedkin, Warren Beatty, Oliver Stone, Steven Soderbergh and Barry Levinson.      After completing The Godfather (1972), Al was so broke he actually owed a studio $15,000 so he never saw a paycheck for his work on that film.      Struggled with alcoholism during the start of his career.      Along with Fay Bainter, Teresa Wright, Barry Fitzgerald, Jessica Lange, Sigourney Weaver, Holly Hunter, Emma Thompson, Julianne Moore, Jamie Foxx and Cate Blanchett, he is one of only eleven actors to receive Academy Award nominations in two acting categories in the same year. He was nominated for Best Actor for Scent of a Woman (1992) and Best Supporting Actor for Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) at the 65th Academy Awards in 1993, winning the former award.      In a long-term relationship with Lucila Sol\xe1 since 2009.      Spent his 77th birthday on a beach getaway in Tulum, Mexico with his girlfriend, Lucila Sol\xe1.      Worked various odd jobs to support himself while studying acting.Personal Quotes (75)      The problem with me is, I guess, the way I express myself, you have to be with me 50 years before you can get a sense of what I\'m talking about.      I can\'t say I\'ve been sober though. I don\'t like that word. What does it mean? \'Sober! He\'s very sober\'.      There are times when I have a temperament. Yes, my temperament is there ... but I hope I\'m gentle. Yes, I think I am.      When I try to explain anything I always end up trying to be right usually, but not truthful necessarily. Trying to give the right answer or what I think is the right answer. It\'s a human instinct. You try to be as clever as you can be. You\'re trying to come off like you really know what the hell\'s going on, when you don\'t!      I\'m single and I don\'t particularly like it. I\'m certainly the kind of person who prefers ... it ... it ... It\'s good to have someone in your life that you\'re going through this thing with. It\'s good. That\'s a thing in life that I aspire to.      I like what Norman Mailer said about alcohol: \'Drink has killed a lot of my brain cells and I think I would have been a better writer without it, but it would be one less way to relax.\'      Did you know I started out as a stand-up comic? People don\'t believe me when I tell them.      [on whether acting and his roles reflected who he is] In the end you\'re just playing a role.      I\'ll tell you something. And this is a fact. When I was doing Scarface (1983), I remember being in love at that time. One of the few times in my life. And I was so glad it was at that time. I would come home and she would tell me about her life that day and all her problems and I remember saying to her, \'Look, you really got me through this picture\', because I would shed everything when I came home.      That\'s right! That\'s right! We know the best feeling in the world is the one between the second and third martini. That was my deal. I just enjoyed who I became when I was drinking, so that was something hard to break. I became much quieter, and funny. I must say, that kind of thing came out.      I hope the perception is that I\'m an actor, I never intended to be a movie star.      I\'m constantly striving to break through to something new. You try to maintain a neutral approach to your work, and not be too hard on yourself.      I guess you find yourself repeating certain motifs. But at the heart of it all, I\'m an actor, always looking for a role. And then you try to make things fresh.      People always said that time, the \'70s, was about pretty boys, and then I came along!      One hopes to find out about the [movie] you\'re in while you\'re doing it, not several years later, which is usually when I find out. I\'m like, \'Wow, that was a dud! I didn\'t know, nobody would tell me!\' I\'ve done things for certain reasons, but it [comes from] thinking on your feet... Sometimes actors do things not because we have a great desire [for it], but because it\'s work, and I\'m starting to wonder about that.      But I was just lucky. People like [Francis Ford Coppola] were making films, and I got opportunities.       by Robert Osborne in ""Academy Awards 1974 Oscar Annual""] I couldn\'t exist just doing films. But on the other hand, there is the fame that comes with it, and the money. My problem is I still want to play Hamlet in some little theater somewhere, and time is running out.      [Presenting the Lifetime of Achievement Award to director Sidney Lumet at the 2005 Academy Awards] As an old village poet put it to me in the 1960s. [If you dig it, it\'s yours]. I dug Sidney Lumet back then. I dig him now because what he had to give, I took and made it mine. I\'m forever grateful along with all the other actors and writers who have benefited from Sidney\'s genius.      [on his friend and Heat (1995) co-star Robert De Niro] We know each other\'s minds. We have shared some things that are personal to us, such as our roles. I know Bobby through his roles. But, then, I don\'t think we actually talked about the actual work of actors.      [on his friend and Heat (1995) co-star Robert De Niro] I remember seeing things that Bob had done in the past, and very recent times, and have been taken with the work so much that I even wrote [him] about it. Some of his great work -- which is plenty -- I was staggered by the subtlety of his portrayal and the warmth, which is what we often talk about with Bob among us actors who admire him so. It is the warmth and the way he approaches things.      [on doing Scarecrow (1973) with Gene Hackman] Gene and I are two people not very similar. We had to play a very close relationship, but I just didn\'t think we were as connected as we should have been. We seemed apart. We didn\'t have altercations, we didn\'t hate each other. But we didn\'t communicate, didn\'t think in the same terms. Gene and I were thrown together, but under ordinary circumstances we\'d never cavort or be friends. It was two worlds - but I have to say that I was as much responsible as he was.      [on whether or not acting is still challenging for him] The challenge? It\'s always a challenge of a sort. It\'s a challenge to get up and go and leave your family and go out there in all different parts of the world and do a picture and try to make it come alive . . . You\'re still challenged for that. I mean, it\'s the same story. It\'s just not changed. It seems to be the same thing it always was. It\'s this effort. If you get excited about a thing then things are generally a little easier. If you get enthusiastic and you want to do something and you feel you are into something then things start to come. But usually to find the enthusiasm and the appetite, that\'s the challenge.      [on why his film Chinese Coffee (2000) has yet to be released] \'Coffee\' is done, I got a couple of little important things to do about it, like little tiny things, and THEN I will unveil it. It\'s not a movie that you put in a . . . it needs a certain environment to flourish in. It\'s just the way it is. It doesn\'t make it better or worse than the picture. It\'s just the way it is, the nature of it.      I\'ve always believed, I always hoped . . . I don\'t think I know what I\'m saying when I say this, but I was hoping that we could have a museum where we had films. That there was a museum where films were, like, hung. Like paintings. And you went to the museum. I got the movie The Local Stigmatic (1990) that I made. It\'s 52 minutes and everybody has seen it now because I\'ve personally got them in to see it, to show it to them and I paid them for it, too. But it\'s over at the Museum of Modern Art and I love saying . . . This is really pretentious of me, this is what I really like. I love to say: \'Oh, it\'s at the Museum of Modern Art. Isn\'t that great?\' \'Have you released it?\' \'No, I never did.\' I love saying that, you know? \'How come?\' \'Because I didn\'t feel like it.\' It\'s fun to do that.      The actor becomes an emotional athlete. The process is painful -- my personal life suffers.      My first language was shy. It\'s only by having been thrust into the limelight that I have learned to cope with my shyness.      I don\'t understand the hatred and fear of gays and bisexuals and lesbians...it\'s a concept I honestly cannot grasp. To me, it\'s not who you love...a man, a woman, what have you...it\'s the fact THAT you love. That is all that truly matters.      [When asked what romantic character he would want to be] [Pablo Picasso]. I love the idea that he used to just sit and stare at an empty canvas for as long as 12 hours straight. If you keep staring at the canvas, the hope is that something or someone will come to mind. That\'s a romantic notion in itself.      [When asked what a movie of his life would be called and who would play him] It would be called \'The Dustin Hoffman Story\'. When we were starting out, [Robert De Niro], me and Hoffman were always sort of mixed up. People mistook us for each other.      In America most everybody who\'s Italian is half Italian. Except me. I\'m all Italian. I\'m mostly Sicilian, and I have a little bit of Neapolitan in me. You get your full dose with me.      [on The Godfather: Part III (1990)] You know what the problem with that film is? The real problem? Nobody wants to see Michael have retribution and feel guilty. That\'s not who he is. In the other scripts, in Michael\'s mind he is avenging his family and saving them. Michael never thinks of himself as a gangster - not as a child, not while he is one and not afterward. That is not the image he has of himself. He\'s not a part of the Goodfellas (1990) thing. Michael has this code; he lives by something that makes audiences respond. But once he goes away from that and starts crying over coffins, making confessions and feeling remorse, it isn\'t right. I applaud [Francis Ford Coppola] for trying to get to that, but Michael is so frozen in that image. There is in him a deep feeling of having betrayed his mother by killing his brother. That was a mistake. And we are ruled by these mistakes in life as time goes on. He was wrong. Like in Scarface (1983) when Tony kills Manny - that is wrong, and he pays for it. And in his way, Michael pays for it.      My dad was in the army. World War II. He got his college education from the army. After World War II he became an insurance salesman. Really, I didn\'t know my dad very well.      [on Julie Christie] The most poetic of actresses.      The only problem is, I don\'t have the appetite to make my own pictures. I don\'t want to direct. So I\'m always in a kind of passive position, waiting for someone to come to me with a project... That I sort of don\'t like.      [on Heat (1995)] I remember chasing Bobby De Niro around at 3 a.m. I didn\'t warm up and boom, there went my hamstring. I was like, ""Great, I feel like old Al."" Then I realized, ""I AM old Al."" I guess I have to keep in shape as I get older. But I don\'t like to work out. Whenever I get the urge to exercise, I lie down until it passes.      [on Jack Lemmon] Jack was the most selfless actor I\'ve ever worked with. He was the most considerate and the most generous. He cared a great deal about what he was doing. He was a complete actor who gave 150 percent. But the remarkable thing about Jack was that he kept growing. So his best work was his latest work.      [on making The Godfather (1972)] Every time I\'d run into Marlon Brando on set, my face would turn red and I\'d start laughing...have you any idea what it was like to do a scene with Brando? I sat in movie houses when I was a kid watching Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and Viva Zapata! (1952). Now I\'m playing a scene with him. He\'s God, man!      It surprised me, the feeling I got when I won the Oscar for Scent of a Woman (1992). It was a new feeling. I\'d never felt it. I don\'t see my Oscar much now. But when I first got it, there was a feeling for weeks afterward that I guess is akin to winning a gold medal in the Olympics. It\'s like you\'ve won a race and everybody knows you won. It\'s a wonderful feeling, a complete feeling.      An actor with too much money will usually find a way to get rid of it.      He who persists at his folly will one day be wise.      After every movie, Humphrey Bogart -- even at the end -- was very worried he\'d never get another part. If you don\'t get the job, there\'s no work, there\'s no outlet, there\'s no expression, there\'s no painting. You just live and hope that another day will come with a role that will serve as a canvas for you.Gary Cooper was kind of a phenomenon - his ability to take something and elevate it, give it such dignity. One of the great presences. Charles Laughton was my favorite. Jack Nicholson has that kind of persona; he\'s also a fine actor. Robert Mitchum\'s great. Lee Marvin, too. These guys are terrific actors.      I recommend watching The Dresser (1983). It\'s a great movie if you want to know about actors.      I am a dancer, but I don\'t think I would be on Dancing with the Stars (2005) mainly because I would be too shy.      The most popular movie I\'ve ever made is Scarface (1983), all over the world. It\'s amazing to me. It\'s wonderful. We sometimes forget that it was Oliver Stone who wrote it. He is a political creature, and I think that is an undercurrent in the movie. And the combination of him and Brian De Palma made for this kind of fusion or explosion. It worked.      (1979, on Marlon Brando) There\'s no doubt every time I see Brando that I\'m looking at a great actor. Whether he\'s doing great acting or not, you\'re seeing somebody who is in the tradition of a great actor. What he does with it, that\'s something else, but he\'s got it all. The talent, the instrument is there, that\'s why he has endured. I remember when I first saw On the Waterfront. I had to see it again, right there. I couldn\'t move, I couldn\'t leave the theater. I had never seen the likes of it. I couldn\'t believe it.      (1979, Playboy Magazine) Bang the Drum Slowly is my all-time-favorite film. I saw that three or four times. I\'d like to go see it again. The baseball motif, the quality of the relationship between Moriarty and De Niro, is beautiful. Maybe I relate to it because I wanted to be a baseball player. For some reason, people don\'t talk about that movie.      (1979 quote on his first time at the Oscars) I was at the Oscars once, for Serpico. That was the second time I was nominated. I was sitting in the third or fourth row with Diane Keaton. Jeff Bridges was there with his girl. No one expected me to come. I was a little high. Somebody had done something to my hair, blew it or something, and I looked like I had a bird\'s nest on my head, a real mess. I sat there and tried to look indifferent because I was so nervous. Any time I\'m nervous, I try to put on an indifferent or a cold look. At one point, I turned to Jeff Bridges and said, ""Hey, looks like there won\'t be time to get to the Best Actor awards."" He gave me a strange look. He said, ""Oh, really?"" I said, ""It\'s over, the hour is up."" He said, ""It\'s three hours long."" I thought it was an hour TV show, can you imagine that? And I had to pee-bad. So I popped a Valium. Actually, I was eating Valium like they were candy. Chewed on them. Finally came the Best Actor. Can you imagine the shape I was in? I couldn\'t have made it to the stage. I was praying, ""Please don\'t let it be me. Please."" And I hear . . . ""Jack Lemmon."" I was just so happy I didn\'t have to get up, because I never would have made it.      [1979, Playboy Magazine] I wanted to be a baseball player, naturally, but I wasn\'t good enough. I didn\'t know what I was going to do with my life. I just had a kind of energy, I was a fairly happy kid, although I had problems in school. In the eighth grade, the drama teacher wrote my mother a letter saying she should encourage me. I used to recite The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. And I would read the Bible in the auditorium. That was the first time I heard of Marlon Brando. I was in a play and they said, ""Hey, Marlon Brando - this guy acts like Marlon Brando."" Isn\'t that weird? I was about 12. I guess it was because I was supposed to get sick onstage and I really did get sick every time we did this play. Actually, the person I related to was James Dean. I grew up with the Dean thing. Rebel Without a Cause (1955) had a very powerful effect on me.      (1979, on his beginning as an actor at the High School of Performing Arts) I was never very happy with performing; it didn\'t turn me on much. If I made a catch at third base, I\'d do a double somersault and sprawl out on the ground. I was acting-overacting. They taught Stanislavsky at Performing Arts. That whole thing about the Method and serious acting, having to feel it, I thought it was crazy. What was going on? Where was the fun? So I was kind of bored with it.      (1979, on his pre-fame job as a building superintendent) I was about 26. My friend told me about this job with a rent-free apartment and $14 a week. So I went down and got a boiler\'s permit and came back and I was a super. It was my first real place that was not a rooming house or sharing with a girl-I had lived with a girl before that. Now I had my own little home. I had no money, hardly anything to eat, but I had a roof over my head. I was a super for 11 months. I drank, actually, but I hung in there and came out of it. It was a very fruitful time and, at the same time, it was the lowest time in my life. I used to hang an 8 x 10 glossy of me on the door.      [on people considering him a legend] I\'m very flattered to hear that, that compliment. I don\'t think of myself as anything but an actor struggling to find the next role and when I do get the role to try and see if I can find any way into it.      With young actors I learn from them, just as hopefully I always will. If I were to advise them in some way, I would say this is a craft that you just have to keep doing. Do it whenever you can and you shouldn\'t spend too much time dealing with the fact that there\'s a world out there with a lot of competition. You have to educate yourself. You have to read. You have to see things that are inspiring to you.      [on the casting of Michael Corleone in The Godfather (1972)] Francis [Ford Coppola] knew I could do the part, and so did I. But he kept asking me to test again and again. I didn\'t want to go. I don\'t go where I\'m not wanted. Once I got the role, I was waking up at four or five in the morning and going into the kitchen to brood over [it].      [on preparing to play the character of Tony Montana in Scarface (1983)] I worked with an expert in knife combat, with a physical education guy who helped me get the kind of body I wanted for the part. I used the boxer Roberto Dur\xe1n a little bit. There was an aspect of Dur\xe1n , a certain lion in him that I responded to in this character. And I was very inspired by Meryl Streep\'s work in Sophie\'s Choice (1982). I thought that her way of involving herself in playing someone who is from another country and another world was particularly fine and committed and... courageous.      I\'m the same now as I\'ve always been - sort of a recluse. People resent me for remaining myself when they think I should be acting like a superstar. I never wanted to be an actor and I don\'t particularly enjoy it. I have to act. There just isn\'t anything else for me.      [on being in Dublin, Ireland] I always feel so at home here, it\'s great. In fact, I just want to do a movie here so then I could really stay for a while, get around and see it, and be a part of it.      [on the tough neighborhood he grew up in] They used to call it Fort Apache - the 41st Precinct. But that was the start of the heroin thing. Around 1948 that\'s when the drugs came into New York. That\'s when the trouble started. Of all my dearest, closest friends from that time, none of them survived.      [on his acting teacher Lee Strasberg] Someone said to him: \'Oh, I know you.\' He replied: \'You know my name. You don\'t know me\'.      [on being offered the part of Michael Corleone in The Godfather (1972)] Naturally my first thought was: \'I can\'t play that. It\'s a really hard part. Can\'t I play Sonny? That\'s a good part.\' Then all this screen testing began. It was the Scarlett O\'Hara of its day. Francis put that cast together and they okayed everybody except for me and Marlon Brando. Finally, they okayed Marlon. \'But this kid? No way!\'      [on working with Marlon Brando in The Godfather (1972)] I loved him. He was such a sensitive person. He saw the difficulties I was having and I think he saw a little of himself when he was young. I was in awe. I remember once he came up behind me and gave me a little massage. \'You okay?\' he\'d say.      Something happened in the 1980s that is hard to define. It had something to do with the movies that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas - both very close friends of Francis Ford Coppola - started to make. I met them when they were kids. I saw them as real film people. I got no feeling of theatre from them. They are geniuses. But they set the standard for a new kind of movie. You also can\'t discount the impact of television. It\'s a complex story. Those socially concerned movies like Serpico (1973) or Dog Day Afternoon (1975) or Taxi Driver (1976) were no longer as doable. Those films became independent film. They were no longer launched as brassy marquee features. That\'s exactly right. You look at The Panic in Needle Park (1971): a film about two drug addicts in the city. That was made by Fox. They could never get that made today.      [on Scarface (1983)] We couldn\'t show our faces after it opened. I was at a party after a screening at Sardi\'s. I walked in and the faces looked like those in a wax museum. People were sitting so still. Liza Minnelli was there. She hadn\'t seen the movie. She came up to me and said: \'What did you do to these people?\' And yet it survived.      The first thing that comes to mind about Sea of Love (1989)? Ellen Barkin\'s body.      [on rejecting the role of John McClane in Die Hard (1988)] I gave that boy [Bruce Willis] a career.      I was smoking at nine and smoking a pipe by 12... well, I was dramatic. The cop on the beat used to buy us booze when I was 13 and 14. He was a great guy. He would say, \'Have a little of this\', and he would keep a watch on us. I don\'t know that it would be politically correct but he is not working anymore and is long retired.      [on turning down the part of Han Solo in Star Wars (1977)] That role was mine for the taking but I couldn\'t understand the script.      [on The Godfather trilogy] A long, awful, tiring story.      I asked God for a bike, but I know God doesn\'t work that way. So I stole a bike and asked for forgiveness.      [on directing] I have worked with many great film directors and seen that there is a level of film-making that I can never get to so I don\'t even bother. I just enjoy engaging in film as an amateur. I don\'t have the pressure of having to deliver. I am off the hook.      [on being off-screen from 1985 to 1989] I poured my own money into my own film, The Local Stigmatic (1990). Which I never released. I did some plays. All of a sudden the years passed and suddenly I owed some back taxes and the mortgage was due and I was broke. But you know what really hit me? I was walking through Central Park and this guy comes up to me - didn\'t know him at all - and he says, \'Hey, what happened to you? We don\'t see you, man.\' I said, \'Well, I... uh... uh...\' and he said, \'C\'mon Al, I want to see you up there.\' And I recognized that I was lucky to have what I\'ve been given. You gotta use it.      [on one\'s career] I think that the idea of resurgence is wonderful. But basically I think it\'s just luck. Also, if you start to say, \'How about if I made a movie with this person who is really a good director?\' or \'How about if I did a movie about something that I feel I\'ve got something to say about?\' These things happen and I feel you\'re lucky when it happens.      [on Diane Keaton getting him back into movies after a four-year hiatus in the 1980s] I\'d probably be a short-order cook right now if it wasn\'t for Diane. I\'d become kind of detached from everything and I was enjoying a life out of the mix. She\'s the one who found Sea of Love (1989) and told me I should do it. She said, \'You\'re not on the A-list anymore, buddy. Are you going to go back to living in a rooming house? You\'ve been rich too long. You\'re an adult now.\'""      [on Johnny Depp] -- Johnny is one of the greatest actors of his generation. He has incredible instincts. He\'s able to put himself into the head of his character and vary his level according to the needs of each scene. That\'s a very rare gift.      [on becoming famous] The reaction wasn\'t positive. I was catapulted out of a cannon. People are more accepting of fame today because of all the media outlets. Young people even aspire to it. I became more aware of myself, constantly reminded that I had this name because strangers kept calling me by it. Being an outsider is part of being an artist. You try to conform. But some of us just can\'t. I didn\'t know what was expected of me. I still don\'t.Salary (8)The Godfather\xa0(1972)      $35,000       The Godfather: Part II\xa0(1974)      $500,000 and 10% of the gross after break-even      ...and justice for all.\xa0(1979)      $1,000,000       The Godfather: Part III\xa0(1990)      $5,000,000       Glengarry Glen Ross\xa0(1992)      $1,500,000       Carlito\'s Way\xa0(1993)      $6,000,000       Insomnia\xa0(2002)       ca. $11,000,000      S1m0ne\xa0(2002)      $11,000,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","[u'\nRobert Duvall ', u'""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 89 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(4)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(5)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(44)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(30)\xa0|Salary\xa0(1)  Overview (4)Date of Birth5\xa0January1931,\xa0San Diego, California, USA Birth NameRobert Selden DuvallNicknameBob    Height5\'\xa09\xbd""\xa0(1.77\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Veteran actor and director Robert Selden Duvall was born on January 5, 1931, in San Diego, CA, to Mildred Virginia (Hart), an amateur actress, and William Howard Duvall, a career military officer who later became an admiral. Duvall majored in drama at Principia College (Elsah, IL), then served a two-year hitch in the army after graduating in 1953. He began attending The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre In New York City on the G.I. Bill in 1955, studying under Sanford Meisner along with Dustin Hoffman, with whom Duvall shared an apartment. Both were close to another struggling young actor named Gene Hackman. Meisner cast Duvall in the play ""The Midnight Caller"" by Horton Foote, a link that would prove critical to his career, as it was Foote who recommended Duvall to play the mentally disabled ""Boo Radley"" in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962). This was his first ""major"" role since his 1956 motion picture debut as an MP was in Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956), starring Paul Newman.Duvall began making a name for himself as a stage actor in New York, winning an Obie Award in 1965 playing incest-minded longshoreman ""Eddie Carbone"" in the off-Broadway revival of Arthur Miller\'s ""A View from the Bridge"", a production for which his old roommate Hoffman was assistant director. He found steady work in episodic TV and appeared as a modestly billed character actor in films, such as Arthur Penn\'s The Chase (1966) with Marlon Brando and in Robert Altman\'s Countdown (1967) and Francis Ford Coppola\'s The Rain People (1969), in both of which he co-starred with James Caan.He was also memorable as the heavy who is shot by John Wayne at the climax of True Grit (1969) and was the first ""Maj. Frank Burns"", creating the character in Altman\'s Korean War comedy MASH (1970). He also appeared as the eponymous lead in George Lucas\' directorial debut, THX 1138 (1971). It was Francis Ford Coppola, casting The Godfather (1972), who reunited Duvall with Brando and Caan and provided him with his career breakthrough as mob lawyer ""Tom Hagen"". He received the first of his six Academy Award nominations for the role.Thereafter, Duvall had steady work in featured roles in such films as The Godfather: Part II (1974), The Killer Elite (1975), Network (1976), The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976) and The Eagle Has Landed (1976). Occasionally this actor\'s actor got the chance to assay a lead role, most notably in Tomorrow (1972), in which he was brilliant as William Faulkner\'s inarticulate backwoods farmer. He was less impressive as the lead in Badge 373 (1973), in which he played a character based on real-life NYPD detective Eddie Egan, the same man his old friend Gene Hackman had won an Oscar for playing, in fictionalized form as ""Popeye Doyle"" in The French Connection (1971).It was his appearance as ""Lt. Col. Kilgore"" in another Coppola picture, Apocalypse Now (1979), that solidified Duvall\'s reputation as a great actor. He got his second Academy Award nomination for the role, and was named by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most versatile actor in the world. Duvall created one of the most memorable characters ever assayed on film, and gave the world the memorable phrase, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning!"".Subsequently, Duvall proved one of the few established character actors to move from supporting to leading roles, with his Oscar-nominated turns in The Great Santini (1979) and Tender Mercies (1983), the latter of which won him the Academy Award for Best Actor. Now at the summit of his career, Duvall seemed to be afflicted with the fabled ""Oscar curse"" that had overwhelmed the careers of fellow Academy Award winners Luise Rainer, Rod Steiger and Cliff Robertson. He could not find work equal to his talents, either due to his post-Oscar salary demands or a lack of perception in the industry that he truly was leading man material. He did not appear in The Godfather: Part III (1990), as the studio would not give in to his demands for a salary commensurate with that of Al Pacino, who was receiving $5 million to reprise Michael Corleone.His greatest achievement in his immediate post-Oscar period was his triumphant characterization of grizzled Texas Ranger Gus McCrae in the TV mini-series Lonesome Dove (1989), for which he received an Emmy nomination. He received a second Emmy nomination and a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in Stalin (1992), and a third Emmy nomination playing Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in The Man Who Captured Eichmann (1996).The shakeout of his career doldrums was that Duvall eventually settled back into his status as one of the premier character actors in the industry, rivaled only by his old friend Gene Hackman. Duvall, unlike Hackman, also has directed pictures, including the documentary We\'re Not the Jet Set (1977), Angelo My Love (1983) and Assassination Tango (2002). As a writer-director, Duvall gave himself one of his most memorable roles, that of the preacher on the run from the law in The Apostle (1997), a brilliant performance for which he received his third Best Actor nomination and fifth Oscar nomination overall. The film brought Duvall back to the front ranks of great actors, and was followed by a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nod for A Civil Action (1998).Robert Duvall will long be remembered as one of the great naturalistic American screen actors in the mode of Spencer Tracy and his frequent co-star Marlon Brando. His performances as ""Boo Radley"" in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), ""Jackson Fentry"" in Tomorrow (1972), ""Tom Hagen"" in the first two ""Godfather"" movies, ""Frank Hackett"" in Network (1976), ""Lt. Col. Kilgore"" in Apocalypse Now (1979), ""Bull Meechum"" in The Great Santini (1979), ""Mac Sledge"" in Tender Mercies (1983), ""Gus McCrae"" in Lonesome Dove (1989) and ""Sonny Dewey"" in The Apostle (1997) rank as some of the finest acting ever put on film. It\'s a body of work that few actors can equal, let alone surpass.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Jon C.

Is response to Duvall\'s criticism of his trip to Cuba, Steven Spielberg defended himself by explaining that he actually went with permission from the American government as a cultural ambassador.      Was considered for the role of Police Chief Martin Brody in the horror film Jaws (1975), which went to Roy Scheider.      Being a huge soccer fan, he supports the Argentinian national side.

[January 2008]      Put up $5 million of his own money to finance The Apostle (1997) after this was rejected by numerous studios.      Travels to Argentina at least five times a year and has a home there.      He says the work he is most proud of by far is his role as the former Texas Ranger Augustus McCrae in the miniseries Lonesome Dove (1989).      Has a family connection to two 2008 Presidential hopefuls. One of his ancestors, Mareen Duvall, is also an ancestor of Barack Obama.

Narrated a video supporting John McCain for the Republican National Convention in 2008.      The middle of three brothers, his elder brother William Duvall and younger brother John Duvall both appeared as singers in his film Angelo My Love (1983).      Named Mitt liv som hund (1985) as one of his favorite movies.      Being descended from Robert E. Lee, he can actually trace his family back to President George Washington. Washington himself had no biological children, but his wife, Martha Custis, did, and he adopted them after the death of Martha\'s first husband. Her son, John Custis, had a son of his own, Washington Custis, whose daughter, Mary Custis, was Robert E. Lee\'s wife. Interestingly, Duvall played Lee in Gods and Generals (2003), opposite Jeff Daniels, who had played Washington in The Crossing (1990). Duvall starred in the adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird (1962).      Has directed one Oscar nominated performance: his own in The Apostle (1997).

Of those, The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather: Part II (1974) are winners in the category.      Duvall attended Principia College in Illinois and received his degree in Liberal Arts. While there he participated in campus theatrical productions and enjoyed the experience.      Joined the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York and studied under Sanford Meisner for two years.

Was considered for the role of Mitch Leary in In the Line of Fire (1993), which went to John Malkovich.Personal Quotes (30)      [on the reason he did not appear in The Godfather: Part III (1990)] If they paid Pacino twice what they paid me, that\'s fine, but not three or four times, which is what they did. (Francis Ford Coppola) came to my farm, parked his car... went in the kitchen. (I) said: ""I know you always wanted the crab cake recipe, let me cook it for you."" Oh, he loves to eat, so I cooked the crab cake... and he wrote it down... and he forgot it, so he called twice. He was... more concerned that he forgot the crab cake recipe than would I be in Godfather III. [January 8, 2004]      [on Hollywood political activists] They should keep their mouths shut.      Being a star is an agent\'s dream, not an actor\'s.      [on James Dean] I don\'t think he was that great. He was good, but there was Brando, and there was founding member Steven Hill in the Actors Studio, those were the two guys. James Dean came in third. Dean was talented, obviously. But he died at a good time.      One guy asked me, ""How can you be an actor and be a Republican?"". I can vote either way. But how can you boil it down to political affiliation? All the atrocities against blacks in the South were committed by Democratic sheriffs.      Everybody likes to win. One of the biggest disappointments was when I didn\'t get an Emmy for Lonesome Dove. It\'s political. It can be a popularity contest.      [1983 comment on Francis Ford Coppola] Coppola\'s talented. I\'m pissed that he cut a scene that would have given the audience an insight into my character in Apocalypse Now (1979), but he\'s talented.      [on Lonesome Dove (1989)] I think I nailed a very specific individual guy who represents something important in our history of the western movement. After that, I felt I could retire, that\'d I\'d done something.      [on Bueno Aires] There\'s a place called La Biela, it\'s my favorite corner in the world. It\'s a coffee shop near the Recoleta where Evita\'s buried. You can go there and sit in the evening, at three in the morning there are hundreds of people in the streets. And you can get up at eight and go back and have your espresso. Going to Argentina, going to Buenos Aires, I like it more there than anyplace else.      I always considered myself as a character actor. I always try to be versatile to show different sides of human experience.      [on Governor Sarah Palin] About a year ago, I first saw this wonderful woman speak. I didn\'t know who it was. And I said who is this woman? And a year later, I said to myself about three or four weeks ago, why isn\'t she up for the vice presidency?      Well, our hero, coming up, was Brando. He kinda squandered it. But he was so revolutionary in so many ways.      The way Hollywood speaks out is absolutely beyond me. Some people are so ill-informed. I mean, why be so outspoken about it anyway? Does it help Sean Penn\'s career to go over to Iraq? Did it help Jane Fonda to go over to Vietnam years ago? I don\'t know. But sometimes when these guys speak out... I get embarrassed.Marlon Brando had an innate shrewdness, finding ways to do things better than everyone else. One of the great tragedies is that Brando never developed his tremendous potential. He really was the godfather to young actors coming up in the seventies and even today. He was the guy, really, more than [Laurence Olivier], or anybody.      [on Jeff Bridges] There\'s the Actors Studio in New York, everybody sitting around talking about Stanislavski, but that\'s not Jeff. This is a guy off the beaches of L.A. He learned from his father (Lloyd Bridges), that was his mentor, and he always seems so loose and relaxed -- but he\'s always prepared, and he brings so many surprises, like good actors do.      Because my parents were so religious, I attended church regularly. I\'ve always been a believer.      When I knew nothing, I thought I could do anything.      A friend is someone who many years ago offered you his last $300 when you broke your pelvis. A friend is Gene Hackman.      Making the first Godfather was more laughs than making Godfather II. That\'s because Jimmy Caan was in the first Godfather.      A young actor once asked me, What do you do between jobs? I said, Hobbies, hobbies, and more hobbies. It keeps you off dope.      Sometimes, when you look back on it, the $10-million-and-under movies are some of your favorites.      I feel like our country is just a big giant kid with tremendous talent - like an athlete. A big giant kid that\'s made mistakes, but there\'s a lot of potential.      You never know how reality is going to coincide with your dreams. You\'re optimistic, and you go from there.      Virginia is the last station before heaven.      Getting together with friends and holding court over a meal is one of the great things in life.      I\'m not perceived as a traditional leading man, but I never aimed at that sort of thing either. I never straightened my front teeth, or whatever. I wan\'t cut out for that. Even if I did a \'big\' movie, I\'d still want to make it a real character.      [on other actor/co-stars] Brando was more of a respected actor than Wayne although Wayne wasn\'t as bad as some supposedly serious actors I\'ve seen who trained at the Actors Studio and all that. The thing with Brando is that he reads his lines. He has for 14 years, He\'s a real method. Wayne was interesting to be around. He was pleasant and outgoing. I once took a part with Muhammed Ali because - not that he was a good actor - I wanted to be in his movie. I like to be around people who are famous to see what makes them tick. I worked with Olivier twice, and that was interesting. I wanted to work with De Niro again, so I did True Confessions (1981).      Method acting is a way of working internally as a substitute if something isn\'t happening for you; if you don\'t need it, it\'s like walking on a good leg instead of using a crutch or cane.      I think studying professionally helped although I had already done summer theater and had a lot of experience. I got right into acting and then studied. The best thing about the Playhouse was that I really learned to improvise, to change things, in films. Not in an indulgent way, but in a beneficial way. So from that point of view, Sndy was good for me. I might have learned it eventually - you learn from other actors, directors. The problem is so many people study but they don\'t get any better. It\'s up to the individual. And I don\'t think a teacher can manufacture talent. i guy can study all his life on a violin ad never play it well.      I got into acting because I wanted to act, not to become a star. The word \'star\' is so strange, especially in this country, I think, I don\'t know. It has something to do with a whole scene. Like with The Great Santini (1979), when I shook the producer\'s hand for the first time - before I could even sit down in the chair - he said, ""They\'re talking about Oscars."" We hadn\'t even started rehearsals yet. I mean, the whole industry is so geared to that - Oscars, the star system.Salary (1)The Godfather\xa0(1972)      $36,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","[u'\nDiane Keaton ', u'""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 72 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(5)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(42)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(17)\xa0|Salary\xa0(3)  Overview (4)Date of Birth5\xa0January1946,\xa0Los Angeles, California, USA Birth NameDiane HallNicknameAnnie    Height5\'\xa06\xbd""\xa0(1.69\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Diane Keaton was born Diane Hall in Los Angeles, California, to Dorothy Deanne (Keaton), an amateur photographer, and John Newton Ignatius ""Jack"" Hall, a civil engineer and real estate broker.

As understudy to the lead, she gained attention by not removing any of her clothing. In 1970, Woody Allen cast her in his Broadway play ""Play It Again, Sam,"" which had a successful run. It was during this time that she became involved with Allen and appeared in a number of his films. The first one was Play It Again, Sam (1972), the screen adaptation of the stage play. That same year Francis Ford Coppola cast her as Kay in the Oscar-winning The Godfather (1972), and she was on her way to stardom. She reprized that role in the film\'s first sequel, The Godfather: Part II (1974). She then appeared with Allen again in Sleeper (1973) and Love and Death (1975).In 1977 she broke away from her comedy image to appear in the chilling Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977), which won her a Golden Globe nomination. It was the same year that she appeared in what many regard as her best performance, in the title role of Annie Hall (1977), which Allen wrote specifically for her (her real last name is Hall, and her nickname is Annie), and what an impact she made. She won the Oscar and the British Award for Best Actress, and Allen won the Directors Award from the DGA. She started a fashion trend with her unisex clothes and was the poster girl for a lot of young males. Her mannerisms and awkward speech became almost a national craze. The question being asked, though, was, ""Is she just a lightweight playing herself, or is there more depth to her personality?"" For whatever reason, she appeared in but one film a year for the next two years and those films were by Allen. When they broke up she was next involved with Warren Beatty and appeared in his film Reds (1981), as the bohemian female journalist Louise Bryant. For her performance she received nominations for the Academy Award and the Golden Globe. For the rest of the 1980s she appeared infrequently in films but won nominations in three of them. Attempting to break the typecasting she had fallen into, she took on the role of a confused, somewhat naive woman who becomes the tool of Middle Eastern terrorists in The Little Drummer Girl (1984). To offset her lack of movie work, Diane began directing. She directed the documentary Heaven (1987), as well as some music videos. For television she directed an episode of the popular, but strange, Twin Peaks (1990).In the 1990s she began to get more mature roles, though she reprized the role of Kay Corleone in the third ""Godfather"" epic, The Godfather: Part III (1990). She appeared as the wife of Steve Martin in the hit Father of the Bride (1991) and again in Father of the Bride Part II (1995). In 1993 she once again teamed with Woody Allen in Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993), which was well received. In 1995 she received high marks for Unstrung Heroes (1995), her first major feature as a director.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Tony Fontana          Trade Mark (5)        Frequently wears gloves        Frequently wears white        Known for playing eccentric, free spirited, often independent minded characters.

[on her nude scene in Something\'s Gotta Give (2003)] At this point, does it really matter? Nobody is looking at me the way I once imagined people would look at me, like with deviant thoughts. I think they just go, ""Huh. There it is. Intact.""      I find the same thing sexy in a man now as I always have: humor. I love it when they are funny. It\'s to die for.      Of course I recognized myself in the roles [Woody Allen] wrote. I mean, in Annie Hall (1977) particularly. I was this sort of novice who had lots of feelings but didn\'t know how to express herself, and I see that in Annie. I think Woody used a kind of essential quality that he found in me at that time, and I\'m glad he did because it worked really well in the movie.      I build a wall around myself. I\'m hard to get to know. Any trait you have, it gets worse as you go along.      I think about dying every single day. I\'ve lost lots of friends, and they die in the most bizarre ways. It\'s like, ""That can\'t possibly be! How could that have happened?"" And all I can think is, ""That could have been me.""      It\'s kind of true, you do disappear off the planet if you are a middle-aged woman, but that has some advantages as well. Because too much of my life was spent waiting to be seen. Hoping to be seen, hoping to be picked. Once you realize that you aren\'t looked at that way any more, other things start to happen and you have to depend on other things to get by.      I had a career and I came to motherhood late and am not married and have never had such a trusting relationship with a man - and trust is where the real power of love comes from.      When I was younger I had these enormous vanities about what I expected from myself. I\'m glad to have a comfortable and fascinating life, but now I see it for what it is, so I can be braver and more spontaneous and say to myself, ""Oh, screw it, just go out there and do it.""      I\'m limited, so, I kind of know where I fit as an actress. I kind of get it now, finally, after all of these years of trying to be a dramatic actress. I kind of think that\'d I\'d like to continue dealing with these things in a funny, lighter vein, but also truthful and honest.      I just have to keep going back to the core and think that we\'re all afraid of it and when we\'re afraid of it, you run to something much easier, something that looks like candy.      [Regarding getting drug shots before each performance of the 1968 rock musical, ""Hair""] At the time it was astonishing to have a job. It was odd. Before the show opened we got a shot by a doctor Bishop. A vitamin shot, only it was not vitamins. It was like methamphetamines. You were flying. A lot of people got addicted.      The idea of speaking your thoughts out loud is so important. It\'s been downplayed recently because now we have medication to help people in situations. But I think it\'s important to talk your thoughts out loud, because you don\'t really own them until you do that.      When I first got to know Woody and I was going out with him, I noticed that people never wanted to hear anything that I had to say at all. They just wanted to be in the shadow of his light and I remember really having a hard time with that.      I would audition for the talent show when I was in junior high school, and I was going to sing All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth. But it was my mother\'s idea that I black out my teeth at the tryout, and that of course secured my position on the list of people who would be in the talent show.      When I was little, we\'d get in the station wagon and go all over California. Childhood memories can really dominate your life.      Don\'t give up on yourself. So you make a mistake here and there; you do too much or you do too little. Just have fun. Smile. And keep putting on lipstick.Salary (3)The Godfather\xa0(1972)      $35,000       Mrs. Soffel\xa0(1984)      $2,000,000       The Godfather: Part III\xa0(1990)      $1,500,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","[u'\nRobert De Niro ', u'""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 193 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(4)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(2)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(8)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(109)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(55)\xa0|Salary\xa0(14)  Overview (4)Date of Birth17\xa0August1943,\xa0New York City, New York, USA Birth NameRobert Anthony De Niro Jr.NicknamesBobby MilkKid MonroeBobBobby D    Height5\'\xa09\xbe""\xa0(1.77\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)Robert De Niro thought of as one of the greatest actors of all time, was born on August 17, 1943 in Manhattan, New York City, to artists Virginia (Admiral) and Robert De Niro Sr. His paternal grandfather was of Italian descent, and his other ancestry is English, Dutch, German, French and Irish.

After being caught up in a Paris prostitution ring investigation, he, denying any involvement, vowed never to return to France again (1998).      Although he is sometimes referred to as an Italian-American actor, De Niro is actually one quarter Italian in ancestry. His father was of half Italian and half Irish descent. His mother was of Dutch, English, German, French and Irish ancestry on her own father\'s side, and of German ancestry on her own mother\'s side. Robert was quite close to his Italian paternal grandfather, whom he visited frequently in Syracuse, New York when he was young. De Niro has stated that he identifies ""more with [his] Italian side"". He was inducted into the Italian-American Hall of Fame in 2002.      He is the second actor to receive an Academy Award for portraying Vito Corleone.

Ranked #78 in Premiere magazine\'s 2002 annual Power 100 List.      In 1993, he was tapped to star as Enzo Ferrari in the film ""Ferrari"", which was budgeted at $65 million (U.S.) and had Michael Mann attached as director. The project fell through.      He organized the first Tribeca Film Festival in May 2002. He intended to revitalize the Lower Manhattan area after the September 11 attacks.      Has said that Meryl Streep is his favorite actress to work with.      He was voted as the best actor of all time at FilmFour.com (2002).

Diagnosed with prostate cancer, and expected to make a full recovery. [October 2003]      Spent four months learning to speak the Sicilian dialect in order to play Vito Corleone in The Godfather: Part II (1974). Nearly all the dialogue that his character spoke in the movie was in Sicilian.      According to a profile in Vanity Fair\'s annual Hollywood issue, is the first actor to do a method interpretation of a cartoon character as Fearless Leader in The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle (2000).      He started the whole ""awards show ribbon"" tradition by wearing a green ribbon on his lapel at the 1981 Academy Awards. The ribbon was in rememberance of several African-American children who were victims of a serial killer in Atlanta, Georgia in 1980-1981. The ribbon was given to him by a fan in the bleachers as he arrived; the victims\' families had been wearing them for months.      Was in Ossining, New York (home of the infamous Sing Sing penitentiary) to shoot three different movies: Analyze This (1999), Analyze That (2002) and Hide and Seek (2005).      In the Egyptian film El Medina (1999), the main actor Ali has a duck that he named De Niro after his favorite actor.      Was voted the No. #2 greatest movie star of all time in a Channel 4 (UK) poll, narrowly being beaten by Al Pacino.      This was tricky to make him look huge as Frankenstein\'s monster in Mary Shelley\'s Frankenstein (1994) , considering that Kenneth Branagh, who played Dr. Frankenstein, is of similar height. Many of the tricks used to make humans, wizards and elves dwarf the hobbits later on for the Lord of the Rings trilogy were also employed to make De Niro appear much bigger than his co-stars, including using very large men as body doubles for shots where only the hands and feet are seen.      He was voted the 34th Greatest Movie Star of all time by Entertainment Weekly.      Singer PJ Harvey refers to De Niro in a song, ""Reeling"", from her album ""4-Track Demos"".Finley Quaye mentions him in the song ""Sunday Shining"", in the line ""I\'m a hero like Robert De Niro"".

Was good friends with comedian John Belushi, who died of a drug overdose on March 5, 1982. In fact, De Niro and Robin Williams were the last stars to see Belushi alive, albeit on separate visits to Bungalow #3 of L.A.\'s Chateau Marmont hotel that fateful day. De Niro visited Belushi at 3:00 am on the morning of his death, but, according to eyewitnesses, left minutes later after seeing that Belushi was sick. Less than an hour earlier, Belushi had been visited by Robin Williams, who also left straight away.      Ranked #1 in Empire (UK) magazine\'s ""The Greatest Living Actor (Gods Among Us)"" list. [October 2004]      At age 17, after leaving the movies with a friend, he unexpectedly stated that he was going to be a film actor. No one believed him until he dropped out of his senior year of high school and joined Stella Adler\'s acting school.      His boyhood idols among actors included Montgomery Clift, Robert Mitchum and Marlon Brando. He preferred the darker, more character-driven work of these men to the older stars of Hollywood, for whom their public persona as a star was more important than their immersion into the character.      Rarely does interviews and is known as one of the most ultra-private celebrities. He was the subject of a late 1990s interview (and cover photo) for Esquire magazine. Most of the article focused on how guarded he is with his personal life, what few details are known about him, what rumors are speculated while only a minority of the article dealt with the actual interview itself. The writer noted that while the interview was ultimately agreed upon, he was given a substantial list of off-limit subjects not to ask De Niro about. They included: politics, religion, his family, his reported interest in fine wines, and so on.      When they met shortly before making Mean Streets (1973) De Niro and Harvey Keitel became fast friends. De Niro was from Greenwich Village in Manhattan and was taught by Stella Adler and Keitel was from the Brighton Beach area of Brooklyn and was mainly mentored by Lee Strasberg. But the two guarded actors bonded and remain close to this day.      He and Martin Scorsese were brought up blocks apart in the Greenwich Village area of Manhattan, but never formally met when they were young. When introduced at a party in 1972, the two came to realize that they had seen each other many times but had never spoken.      Limo drivers in Los Angeles joke about his less than generous tips by referring to him as ""No Dinero"".      Very good friends with fellow actor and frequent co-star, Joe Pesci.      In October 1997, he ranked #5 in Empire (UK) magazine\'s ""The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time"" list. In 2005, Premiere magazine ranked him as #38 on a list of the Greatest Movie Stars of All Time in their Stars in Our Constellation feature.      Both of his Oscar-winning performances involved Marlon Brando. His first Oscar, for Best Supporting Actor, had him playing the younger version of Brando\'s character Vito Corleone. His second, for Best Actor in Raging Bull (1980), he recited Brando\'s famous lines from On the Waterfront (1954).      Underwent surgery for prostate cancer at New York\'s Sloan-Kettering Hospital. The cancer has now gone into remission. [December 2003]      Co-owns the Rubicon restaurant in San Francisco with Bay area residents Francis Ford Coppola and Robin Williams. Much of his father\'s art work adorns the walls of the business. He also owns a restaurant in West Hollywood, Ago, and co-owns several restaurants in New York, including Nobu and Layla.      Shares a birthday with friend and sometime-co-star Sean Penn.      First performer to receive an Academy Award (for The Godfather: Part II (1974)) for a performance in a sequel.      He is a staunch supporter of the US Democratic Party. He lobbied Congress against impeaching President Bill Clinton in 1998. He supported Al Gore in the 2000 Presidential election and supported John Kerry in the 2004 Presidential election. Supported Democratic senator Barack Obama for the 2008 presidential election.      His performance as Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull (1980) is ranked #10 on Premiere magazine\'s 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006).      His performance as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver (1976) is ranked #42 on Premiere magazine\'s 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006).      Early on, before Tim Burton was commissioned as director, was considered for the role of Willy Wonka in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005).      Was offered the role of Dick Tracy in Dick Tracy (1990), which went to Warren Beatty.      Turned down the role of Tony D\'Amato in Any Given Sunday (1999), which went to Al Pacino.      Passed up the opportunity to play Frank Costello in The Departed (2006) to work on his second directorial feature The Good Shepherd (2006).      After Once Upon a Time in America (1984), director Sergio Leone planning to cast De Niro in a film he was working on about the siege of Leningrad in World War II, but that project never came about due to Leone\'s death in 1989.      For the role of Max Cady in Cape Fear (1991), he paid a dentist $5,000 to make his teeth look suitably bad. After filming, he paid $20,000 to have them fixed. For this film, he was tattooed with vegetable dyes, which faded after a few months.      Accidentally broke a rib of Joe Pesci in a sparring scene in Raging Bull (1980). This shot appears in the film: De Niro hits Pesci in the side, Pesci groans, and there is a quick cut to another angle.      Mentioned in \'Weird Al\' Yankovic\'s song, ""Frank\'s 2000 TV"".      Owns residences on the east and west sides of Manhattan as well as near Marbletown, New York.

He based the movement of his character Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver (1976) on that of a crab. He thought the character was indirect and tended to shift from side to side.      He visited Michael Jackson on the set of filming the ""Smooth Criminal"" segment for Moonwalker (1988). Also visiting the set was Gregory Peck, and Bruce Willis.      Was cited as one of the most promising movie personalities of 1973 in John Willis\' 1974 Film Annual ""Screen World"" book.      One of the five winners of the 2009 Kennedy Center Honors.

[January 2011]      Unlike Marlon Brando, who preceded him as Don Vito Corleone, he actually has Italian ancestry in his background. He and Brando both have Dutch ancestry.      He was originally cast in the role of Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York (2002), but pulled out when he discovered this would mean spending six months in Europe and was replaced by Daniel Day-Lewis.      Was considered for the role of Harry in Home Alone (1990), which went to his good friend Joe Pesci.      Is an only child.      Is mentioned in Billy Bragg\'s 1991 song ""Sexuality"".      President of the jury at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.      The longest he has gone without an Oscar nomination is 21 years, between Cape Fear (1991) and Silver Linings Playbook (2012).

As of 2015, has appeared in nine films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: The Godfather: Part II (1974), Taxi Driver (1976), The Deer Hunter (1978), Raging Bull (1980), The Mission (1986), Awakenings (1990), Goodfellas (1990), Silver Linings Playbook (2012) and American Hustle (2013). Of those, The Godfather: Part II (1974) and The Deer Hunter (1978) are winners in the category.The Godfather (1972) predicts both of his Oscar-winning roles. In a scene with Vito Corleone, a poster advertising a Jake LaMotta fight can be seen.      He and his close friend G\xe9rard Depardieu have both received Oscar nominations for playing a role that had already earned an Oscar for another actor. DeNiro won his first Oscar for playing Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather: Part II (1974), a role previously played by Marlon Brando. Depardieu was nominated for Cyrano de Bergerac (1990), a role that previously won an Oscar for Jos\xe9 Ferrer.      Read the book Raging Bull (1980) while filming The Godfather: Part II (1974). His roles in both films would win him an Academy Award.      Has played characters that are Vietnam veterans on five occasions: Taxi Driver (1976), The Deer Hunter (1978), Jacknife (1989), Meet the Parents trilogy, and Grudge Match (2013).      Was considered for the role of Howard Payne in Speed (1994), which went to Dennis Hopper instead.      Before Martin Scorsese was hired to direct Taxi Driver (1976), others considered for the role of Travis Bickle were Jeff Bridges, Jack Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman, Warren Beatty, Burt Reynolds, Ryan O\'Neal, Peter Fonda, Al Pacino, Jon Voight, Robert Blake, David Carradine, Richard Dreyfuss, Christopher Walken, Alain Delon, James Caan, Roy Scheider, Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen, Elliott Gould, Alan Alda, Neil Diamond, George Hamilton, Charles Grodin and Kris Kristofferson.      In the 1950s, Robert lived with his mother in the top floor apartment at 219 West 14th Street in Manhattan\'s ""Little Spain"".      He was offered the roles of Captain Robert Stout and Staff Sergeant Eddie Dohun in A Bridge Too Far (1977) but turned both down. Elliott Gould and James Caan were cast respectively.      Walked out of a Radio Times interview after saying the journalist was asking him questions with a ""negative inference"".      He gained 60 pounds for a single scene playing an older Jake La Motta in Raging Bull (1980).      There is a ""De Niro Men\'s Clothing Shop"" in Chengdu, China.      Turned down the role of Hopper in A Bug\'s Life (1998), which went to Kevin Spacey.      Was considered for the role of Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man 2 (2004), which went to Alfred Molina.      Has worked with eight directors who have won an Oscar for Best Director: Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Bernardo Bertolucci, Elia Kazan, Michael Cimino, Ron Howard, Barry Levinson and Alfonso Cuar\xf3n.      Was offered the role of Mitch Leary in In the Line of Fire (1993), but had to turn down due to scheduling conflicts with A Bronx Tale (1993). The role went to John Malkovich.      Longtime friend/fan and confidant of Whoopi Goldberg.      Prefers making movies to acting on stage.      He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\'s highest civilian award, by President Barack Obama, in a live televised ceremony held in the East Room of the White House, on November 22, 2016, along with twenty other recipients, the the largest, and final Medal of Freedom ceremony of Obama\'s presidency. At this ceremony, the twenty-one recipients, in alphabetical order, included: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Elouise Cobell (posthumous award given to her son), Ellen DeGeneres, Robert De Niro, Richard Garwin, Bill Gates, Melinda Gates, Frank Gehry, Margaret Hamilton (as Margaret H. Hamilton), Tom Hanks, Rear Admiral Grace Hopper (posthumous award given to her niece), Michael Jordan, Maya Lin, Lorne Michaels, Newton Minow, Eduardo Padron (as Eduardo Padr\xf3n), Robert Redford, Diana Ross, Vin Scully, Bruce Springsteen and Cicely Tyson.      He was the one who first made Martin Scorsese aware of Leonardo DiCaprio. He had worked with DiCaprio on This Boy\'s Life (1993) and had been very impressed by his talent and spoke about him to his friend and frequent collaborator. Scorsese and DiCaprio would later work together on many films.      De Niro revealed in March 2016, that his son Elliot is autistic.      In an interview with Total Film magazine in 2007, he praised Eddie Redmayne, whom he directed and starred with in The Good Shepherd (2006), when asked about younger actors whom he liked.Personal Quotes (55)      The talent is in the choices.      It\'s important not to indicate. People don\'t try to show their feelings, they try to hide them.      I don\'t like to watch my own movies - I fall asleep in my own movies.      Don\'t talk it [shooting a scene] away, do it!      Some people say that drama is easy, and comedy is hard. Not true. I\'ve been making comedies the last couple of years, and it\'s nice. When you make a drama, you spend all day beating a guy to death with a hammer, or what have you. Or you have to take a bite out of somebody\'s face. On the other hand, with a comedy, you yell at Billy Crystal for an hour, and you go home.      [interview in Chicago Sun Times, 1/8/98] I think Hollywood has a class system. The actors are like the inmates, but the truth is they\'re running the asylum. You\'ve got to look at the whole studio structure. There\'s these guys. We call them suits. They have the power to okay a film. They\'re like your parents, going, ""We have the money"". But at the same time they say to us actors, ""We love you. We can\'t do without you"". You know, I\'ve been around a long time. I\'ve seen the suits run the asylum. I think I can do it as good or even better. Let me try it. That\'s why I have TriBeCa.      I go to Paris, I go to London, I go to Rome, and I always say, ""There\'s no place like New York. It\'s the most exciting city in the world now. That\'s the way it is. That\'s it.""      I\'ve never been one of those actors who has touted myself as a fascinating human being. I had to decide early on wether I was to be an actor or a personality.      [on acting] The whole thing is for younger people who are sexy and youthful.      [on the mobster characters he often plays] The characters that I play are real. They are real so they have as much right to be portrayed as any other characters. There are other characters I have played, other than those ones that have been called stereotypes or whatever. So.      People treat me with a bit too much reverence. Look at Dustin Hoffman. I always envy the way he can speak and be smart and funny and so on. I just can\'t do that.      [about Al Pacino] Al, over the years we\'ve taken roles from one another. People have tried to compare us to one another, to pit us against one another and to tear us apart personally. I\'ve never seen the comparison frankly. I\'m clearly much taller, more the leading-man type. Honestly, you just may be the finest actor of our generation - with the possible exception of me.      One of the things about acting is it allows you to live other people\'s lives without having to pay the price.      I am part Italian, I\'m not all Italian. I\'m part Dutch, I\'m part French, I\'m part German, I\'m part Irish. But my name is Italian and I probably identify more with my Italian side than with my other parts.      If there is a God he has a lot to answer for.      You\'ll have time to rest when you\'re dead.      After my first movies, I gave interviews. Then I thought, ""What\'s so important about where I went to school, and hobbies? . . . what does any of that have to do with acting, with my own head?""      There is a mixture of anarchy and discipline in the way I work.      [in 2004] I love Italy and I have a deep tie with my Italian roots. I stand for [John Kerry]. I hope he will arrive at the White House. We need a different government to represent America. The change of presidency would be a clear and international sign to say that we are approaching again to the rest of the world. I don\'t want any prize that can influence this election. I stand for Kerry.      (on Taxi Driver (1976)\'s infamous line) You have no idea that, years later, people in cars will recognize you on the street and shout, ""You talkin\' to me?"" I don\'t remember the original script, but I don\'t think the line was in it. We improvised. For some reason it touched a nerve. That happens.      Some people say, ""New York\'s a great place to visit, but I wouldn\'t want to live there"". I say that about other places.      It\'s true: I spent lunchtime in a grave during the filming of Bloody Mama (1970). When you\'re younger, you feel that\'s what you need to do to help you stay in character. When you get older, you become more confident and less intense about it -- and you can achieve the same effect. You might even be able to achieve more if you take your mind off it, because you\'re relaxed. That\'s the key to it all. When you\'re relaxed and confident, you get good stuff.      Movies are hard work. The public doesn\'t see that. The critics don\'t see it. But they\'re a lot of work. A lot of work. When I\'m directing a great dramatic scene, part of me is saying, ""Thank God I don\'t have to do that"". Because I know how fucking hard it is to act. It\'s the middle of the night. It\'s freezing. You gotta do this scene. You gotta get it up to get to that point. And yet, as a director, you\'ve got to get the actors to that point. It\'s hard either way.      When I was a teenager, I went to the Dramatic Workshop at the New School. The school had a lot of actors under the GI Bill -- \'Rod Steiger\', Harry Belafonte, the generation ahead of me. I went in there and the director said to me, ""Vy do you vant to be an acteh?"" I didn\'t know how to answer, so I didn\'t say anything. And he said, ""To express yourself!"" And I said, ""Yeah, yeah, that\'s it. That\'s right.""      [on witnessing the terrorist attack on New York on 9/11/2001] I left a meeting right after they hit the World Trade Center. I went to my apartment, which looks south, and I watched it out my window. I could see the line of fire across the North Tower. I had my binoculars and a video camera--though I didn\'t want to video it. I saw a few people jump. Then I saw the South Tower go. It was so unreal, I had to confirm it by immediately looking at the television screen. CNN was on. That was the only way to make it real. Like my son said: ""It was like watching the moon fall"".      The hardest thing about being famous is that people are always nice to you. You\'re in a conversation and everybody\'s agreeing with what you\'re saying -- even if you say something totally crazy. You need people who can tell you what you don\'t want to hear.      I didn\'t have a problem with rejection, because when you go into an audition, you\'re rejected already. There are hundreds of other actors. You\'re behind the eight ball when you go in there. At this point in my career, I don\'t have to deal with audition rejections. So I get my rejection from other things. My children can make me feel rejected. They can humble you pretty quick.      Money makes your life easier. If you\'re lucky to have it, you\'re lucky.      I only go to Los Angeles when I am paid for it.      Nobody has moved me from my seat yet. But, just in case, I\'ve bought my own restaurants.      [on What Just Happened (2008)] This is as close as it gets to what it can be like to be in the middle of this stuff. The fear factor is always there--everything from losing tens of millions of dollars on a film that doesn\'t work to not being able to get a good table in a top restaurant because your last movie flopped.      It is good to have a few other interests [restaurants, hotels, the TriBeca Film Festival]. But my main interest has always been movies - making them, directing them, being involved. I have never lost the passion for that.      I like New York because I can still walk the streets and sit down in a bar or restaurant and observe people. If you can\'t properly observe, as an actor, you\'re finished. The impression sometimes given is that I can\'t leave my own home without being recognised or bothered in the street. That\'s just not true. I can go out, at leisure, meet people for lunch or take my kids to the park. I don\'t think I am glamorous enough for Hollywood.      I have lived in Los Angeles, working in Hollywood, countless times, doing movies. I am not against the place. I was not a young actor kicking around, living by the seat of my pants, desperate for work. I went by invitation, and my experiences have been good ones. But I have never chosen to live there full-time.      I\'ve always done comedies. There were comic elements in Mean Streets (1973) and even Taxi Driver (1976). And I did The King of Comedy (1982). I\'ve always had what I consider to be a good sense of humour. There is this image that has been built up - invented, more like - and there\'s me, living the life. I do not consider myself some sort of acting legend, just an actor doing his best with the material that is there at the time.      You can look into my background all you like, but I have never had problems with authority on film sets. Even if I disagree with a director, I work through it. I am also not one for regrets. I don\'t regret any film I\'ve made, because there was a reason for making it at the time. If it hasn\'t worked out, then don\'t spend time worrying about why and how. Just move on to the next project.      Difficult? Me? I don\'t think I am difficult compared to other people. It is hard to make a movie at the best of times, so you don\'t want to give people a hard time. People all have their own agendas. But it is not worth acting out something from your own history to make a point on a film set. If you have a problem with, say, your father or some other father figure, why give the director a tough time?      [on Martin Scorsese] I wish I had that knowledge of movies that he has. He\'s like an encyclopedia. I could call him up and ask him about a certain movie, and he would know about it. He\'s seen everything, it\'s great.      (on the lengths he will go to disappear into a part) You don\'t just play a part. You\'ve got to earn the right to play them.      [on Martin Scorsese] I really hope I get to do another movie with him again.      [re Angelina Jolie and Helen Mirren] She [Jolie] is my dream co-star and I love to work with her. It depends on the project [as to who would be] at the top of my list... wonderful actresses.      I always wanted to direct. Directing is a lot more of a commitment though, a lot more time. I like directors who do very few takes, they know what they want. As for me, I know when I have a shot, but I might want back up, and one other take. You never know. If it\'s about capturing a moment, you\'re never going to be able to go back and repeat it, you go with it. It\'s a tricky thing. I go through all the footage, and look at everything.      Some things you learn from just being in movies, so I see what\'s getting done, how it\'s getting done. I know what making a film is going to take, how much time. I almost don\'t even think about it. If I\'m in a movie, I can sense if something is not quite right, if the rhythm is off.      I know it\'s important to give everybody as much freedom as you can so that they don\'t feel there are any limitations. With any mistake they could make, everything is fine. And then they\'re not afraid to try things or trust you when you say, ""Look, let\'s try and go in this direction."" That\'s very important with actors - and all other creative elements.      [on being cast in The Deer Hunter (1978)] I talked with the millworkers, drank and ate with them, played pool. I tried to become as close to being a steelworker as possible, and I would have worked a shift at the mill but they wouldn\'t let me.      I just can\'t fake acting. I know movies are an illusion, and maybe the first rule is to fake it, but not for me. I\'m too curious. I want to deal with all the facts of the character, thin or fat.      [on release of restored version of The King of Comedy (1982) in 2013] I was a big fan of the script and was very excited to do it with Marty [Scorsese] and happy that we finally made it. The fact that it\'s been restored (hard to believe that so many years have passed) is even all the better, and I can\'t wait to see it on our closing night.      The first time I went to Vegas, I was 17. I had a friend who was a dealer in a casino. It was real desert, still like the Wild West. Apparently, there\'s a nightclub scene now. Back then, you gambled and then, at 4am, you went to the lounges to see Sinatra sing.      When you\'re directing, you think of everything ... The few times I\'ve directed, if someone comes up with something you missed, you\'re glad to hear that.      I\'m hoping that if things work out with digital technology, they can finally make us look younger and I can go on for another 40 years.      [on the death of his Flawless (1999) co-star Philip Seymour Hoffman] I\'m very, very saddened by the passing of Phil. He was a wonderful actor. This is one of those times where you say, \'This just shouldn\'t be. He was so young and gifted and had so much going, so much to live for.\' My family and I send our deepest condolences to his family.      [on theatre] I like movies. I mean, I\'d do a play if I could find a great play, a modern play, a new play. But you can do more with film. I like the illusion. In like that you can create something and do it over and then put it together like a big puzzle. With a play, the most you can do is videotape it once and then put it in the archive at the Lincoln Center. Films last. You put it on the screen and it\'s there forever, a little piece of history.      [on the cast reunion for the 25th anniversary of Goodfellas (1990)] We sometimes run into each other. What happens is, you see each other 10 or 15 years later, and it is as if the time has not passed. Because we got to know each other so well at an emotional or spiritual level; and it never goes away.      [referring to Donald J. Trump] I mean he\'s so blatantly stupid. He\'s a punk, he\'s a dog, he\'s a pig, he\'s a con, he\'s a mutt who doesn\'t know what he\'s talking about, he doesn\'t do his homework, doesn\'t care, thinks he\'s gaming his society, doesn\'t pay his taxes, he\'s an idiot. Colin Powell said it best, he\'s a national disaster. He\'s an embarrassment to this country. It makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool, this bozo has wound up where he has. He talks how he wants to punch people in the face, well I\'d like to punch him in the face. This is somebody we want for president? I don\'t think so. What I care about is the direction of this country, and what I\'m very, very worried about is that it might go in the wrong direction with someone like Donald J. Trump.      [on Donald J. Trump] I said that because he said that about somebody, that he would like to punch them in the face. How dare he say that to the crowd? How dare he say the things he does? Of course I want to punch him in the face. It was only a symbolic thing, anyway. It wasn\'t like I was going to go find him and punch him in the face. But he\'s got to hear it.

He is the youngest brother of Sonny and Fredo, and the older brother of Connie.The Godfather: Part IMichael Corleone\'s ascension to the head of the Corleone crime family is portrayed in Puzo\'s novel and the first film.Michael initially wants nothing to do with the ""family business"", and is enrolled at Dartmouth College in search of a more Americanized life. After the United States\' entry into World War II, he enlists in the Marines against his father\'s wishes and fights in the Pacific Theatre. For his bravery, Michael is featured in Life magazine in 1944, having been awarded the Navy Cross. Michael is discharged as a Captain to recover from wounds in 1945. He later re-enters Dartmouth, where he meets his future wife, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton).When his father is nearly assassinated in 1945, he volunteers to murder the man responsible, Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo (Al Lettieri). He also proposes to kill Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), a police captain who removed his father\'s bodyguards from the hospital, presumably to set up his father to be killed. Although it is normally a hard-and-fast rule in the Mafia that law enforcement officials are not to be harmed, Michael successfully convinces his older brother Sonny (James Caan) that since McCluskey is serving as Sollozzo\'s bodyguard, he has crossed into their world and is fair game.After committing the murders, Michael flees to Sicily under the protection of Don Tommasino, a longtime friend of his father\'s, and stays in exile for two years. While in Sicily, he marries a young woman named Apollonia (Simonetta Stefanelli), but she is killed by a car bomb intended for Michael. Fabrizio, one of his bodyguards, was paid by a rival family to plant the bomb.While in Sicily, he learns that Sonny had been murdered, and he returns to New York in 1950. There, he reluctantly becomes involved in his family\'s criminal enterprises, taking over for his deceased brother as operating head of the family under Vito\'s supervision. The family\'s consigliere, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and one of the caporegimes, Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano), are somewhat skeptical of his ability, but the other capo, Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda), thinks somewhat more of him. He marries Kay a year later, promising to make the family legitimate within five years.Michael tries to buy a casino from Moe Greene (Alex Rocco) the casino is partly owned ""off the record"" by the Corleone family. He intends to move his family to Nevada. After his father\'s death in 1955, he becomes official Don of the Corleone crime family. Before his death, Vito had warned Michael that after he was gone, the head of the rival Barzini family would make an attempt on his life under the pretense of organizing a meeting in order to make peace. After Tessio inadvertently reveals that he had conspired with Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte) against him, Michael arranges the murders of Barzini and Philip Tattaglia. In the film, he also kills the other two Mafia chiefs, Carmine Cuneo, and Victor Stracci. Also targeted are Greene, Tessio, Fabrizio and Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), his brother-in-law, who plotted with Barzini to have Sonny killed. With this violent attack, Michael cements his reputation and returns the Corleone family to its position as the most powerful crime family in New York.When his sister Connie (Talia Shire) finds out that Michael had Carlo killed while he stood godfather to their baby, she flies into a rage. Michael dismisses it as hysteria, and when pressed by Kay, denies any involvement in the murder. Just minutes later, however, he meets with his capos, and Clemenza greets him as ""Don Michael."" In the film, Clemenza greets Michael as ""Don Corleone"" and kisses his hand. Unknown to Michael, Kay is watching this meeting, and realizes that Connie was telling the truth after all and that her husband has become the new Don Corleone.Parallel story: The Sicilian (novel only)Michael appears as a secondary character in Puzo\'s The Sicilian. During his two-year exile in Sicily, Michael is eager to return home to his family in New York, but is told by Clemenza that his father wants him to escort Salvatore ""Turi"" Guiliano safely back to America with him. As he learns more about the reputation and exploits of the legendary Guiliano, Michael becomes extremely intrigued to meet him, but Giuliano dies before the meeting can take place.The Godfather: Part IIBy the time of The Godfather Part II, Michael has moved to shake off his family\'s Mafia roots. Frank Pentangeli, a longtime associate of his father\'s, has taken over the family\'s operations in New York.His efforts at going legitimate prove unsuccessful, however, as his enemies keep him involved in the underworld. He begins to work out a deal with business partner and rival Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) over control of casino operations, but Roth manipulates Michael\'s brother Fredo (John Cazale) into unwittingly providing him with information used to arrange an attempt on Michael\'s life.Michael and Roth travel to Cuba to forge a partnership with Fulgencio Batista\'s regime, allowing them to conduct their operations freely. In the midst of the revolution of 1959, Michael discovers that Fredo has betrayed him.Back home, Kay reveals she has aborted their child because she does not want to bring another son of his into the world. Michael divorces Kay and severs ties with her.Following the death of their mother, Michael orders Fredo\'s murder, an act he would regret for the rest of his life.The Godfather: Part IIIBy the time of The Godfather Part III (the late 1970s) Michael has taken great steps to making the family legitimate; he is preparing to hand over his interests in gambling to the other Mafia families, setting up a charitable foundation, and is even being recognized by the Vatican for his good works. This new connection to the Church gives Michael the opportunity to purchase a controlling stake in the large property conglomerate, Immobiliare. He also begins to rekindle his relationship with Kay, as well as taking Sonny\'s illegitimate son, Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), under his wing. He finds himself pulled back into the underworld, however, when almost the entire Mafia Commission is wiped out by an assassin as Michael prepares to hand over his criminal interests. Vinnie responds to this new threat against the Family with brutal violence, publicly gunning down Michael\'s rival, Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna), who was thought to have ordered the hit on Michael. Vinnie also begins a relationship with Michael\'s daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola), a romance Michael strongly disapproves of.At the end of the film, weary of the bloody, lonely life of a Don, he retires and makes his nephew the new head of the family, on condition that he end the relationship with Mary. Realizing that powerful interests in Italian politics and business were working to prevent the family\'s takeover of Immobiliare, Michael, with Vinnie\'s assistance, once again prepares to move against his enemies. This wave of murders takes place as Michael watches his son Anthony (Franc D\'Ambrosio) perform in the opera Cavalleria Rusticana. That same night, however, Mary is inadvertently killed in an assassination attempt on Michael himself. Devastated by this loss, Michael withdraws from life and retires to Sicily, where he dies years later (1997) of a diabetic stroke, sitting alone in a lawn chair.""']","[u'Tom Hagen', u'""Joining the FamilyTom Hagen was orphaned as a child and spent an entire winter on the streets of New York. He then met Sonny, who brought him home with him. The Corleone family took Tom in and Vito had a doctor cure him of an eye infection he had picked up from his late mother. Vito urged Tom not to take on the family name as a show of respect to his late parents; nevertheless Tom became fully integrated into the family.PersonalityThough his late childhood on the streets forced him to develop life-preserving survival skills, the adult Tom rarely if ever shows passion outwardly. He is happily married to a woman he respects and even admires (see The Godfathers Revenge), but also has a mistress. We learn repeatedly that he has little or no interest in entertainment or entertainers, even though the Corleone Family does a great deal of business in Hollywood. The novels reveal that he paid close attention to Vito Corleone while growing up and learned well his skills at analyzing the subtleties of human behavior (as well as the Sicilian dialect). Tom sees as one of his greatest assets his ability to blend in in the ""outside world"" (see The Godfather Returns), since his manner is so lacking in any kind of ostentation. He is thus able to accomplish things in the public sphere such as scanning a small town\'s records to find birth certificates his associates could use for false identities and leave almost no trace in the memories of those around him.The GodfatherAfter Connie Corleone\'s wedding, Hagen is dispatched by Vito Corleone to Hollywood in order to convince Jack Woltz, a big-time movie studio head, to give singer/actor Johnny Fontane (Vito\'s godson) the lead role in his new war film. When he first approaches Woltz, he offers help with some union trouble. Hagen then tells Waltz that one of his actors has moved from marijuana to heroin. A deleted scene in the movie shows that this information was going to be used to expose the star and thus hurt Woltz\'s studio.[1] Woltz at first angrily refuses, but becomes more cordial once he finds out who Hagen works for. Woltz invites him over to his palatial estate for dinner, and shows him his prized stud horse, Khartoum. During the dinner, Woltz tries to work out another deal with Hagen, but refuses to cast Fontane, who had slept with one of his mistresses. Men working for the Corleones break into Woltz\'s stables and decapitate Khartoum, and place the horse\'s severed head and a large amount of its blood in Woltz\'s bed. The next day Hagen receives a call from a ranting Woltz, who threatens to bring the law down on the Corleones\' heads. Hagen gives a nonchalant response and hangs up. Shortly afterwards, Woltz gives Fontane the coveted role.Hagen later compiles information on drug lord Virgil ""the Turk"" Sollozzo, who had approached Vito Corleone on behalf of the Tattaglia crime family to help fund and provide political protection for a heroin operation in New York, in exchange for 30 percent of the profits. Vito, after considering his options, refuses the Turk\'s proposal, though Sonny shows a slight interest.That December, Hagen is abducted by the Turk and his bodyguards. At an undisclosed location, Sollozzo informs Hagen that Don Corleone has been shot and killed, and tells Hagen to convince Sonny to go along with the original deal. Hagen promises to calm Sonny down, but warns the Turk about inevitable reprisal from Luca Brasi, the Don\'s fanatically loyal bodyguard and hitman. Unbeknownst to Hagen, Brasi was killed by Sollozzo and Bruno Tattaglia. The meeting is interrupted when Sollozzo receives word that Don Corleone survived the shooting, which ruins all of Sollozo\'s plans, as Sonny would listen to no deal while his father was still alive.While he loves all the Corleones, Hagen idolizes Sonny, and so blames himself when Sonny is murdered by the Barzinis. After becoming the new head of the family, Michael Corleone removes Hagen as consigliere, restricting him to handling the Family\'s legal business in Nevada, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Hagen accepts the decision, and remains loyal. However, after Vito\'s death, Hagen resumes his role as consigliere.The Godfather: Part IIAfter an attempt on Michael\'s life in The Godfather, Part II, Hagen takes over as acting Don while Michael tries to find out who in his organization had betrayed him and aided the assassins. Hagen is instrumental in both securing the friendship of powerful Senator Pat Geary and defending Michael during the Senate hearings on the Mafia.The fall of Fulgencio Batista\'s regime in Cuba forces Michael to abandon his dream of becoming a legitimate businessman and retake his place as the Don of the Corleone family. As a result, he gives Hagen back his old position as consigliere.Even as Michael becomes increasingly ruthless and paranoid, Hagen dutifully fulfills his role as not just a legal adviser but a dispassionate envoy for the Family. For example, he gives Frank Pentangeli, who had betrayed Michael, the ""option"" of committing suicide so that Pentangeli\'s family would continue to be taken care of after his death.The Godfather: Part IIIAccording to The Godfather: Part III, Hagen dies at some point prior to the timeframe of the film, 1979-1980. There is no specific indication in the film as to when or how he dies, except that it is before the ordination of his son, Andrew, a Roman Catholic priest.The Godfather\'s RevengeMark Winegardner\'s sequel The Godfather\'s Revenge explains that Hagen is murdered in August 1964 by former Corleone underboss Nick Geraci, who drowns him in the Florida Everglades. Geraci then sends Michael a package containing a dead baby alligator along with Hagen\'s wallet, a message similar to the one that is sent to Sonny in the original novel following Luca Brasi\'s death.Behind the scenesThe Hagen character was originally intended to have been featured in The Godfather, Part III, but was written out because of a financial disagreement between Duvall and the film\'s producers. Coppola has stated that Part III was originally planned to feature a split between Michael and Hagen as its central plot. Coppola stated in the film\'s commentary that Duvall demanded the same salary as Al Pacino (who portrayed Michael Corleone).FamilyVito Corleone (Marlon Brando) - Unofficial adopted father Carmella Corleone - Unofficial adopted mother Santino \'Sonny\' Corleone (James Caan) - Unofficial adopted brother Theresa Hagen - Wife Frank and Andrew Hagen (Roman Coppola and Gian-Carlo Coppola) - Sons""']","[u'Kay Adams', u'""""']","[u'Don Vito Corleone', u'""BiographyIn the first film, Don Vito Corleone was portrayed by Marlon Brando. Though composed of characteristics of many gangsters, the Vito Corleone character is based largely on those of Frank Costello and Carlo Gambino. Like Costello, Vito has a raspy voice, has politicians and judges on his payroll, discourages others getting into the narcotics business, and has many gambling interests. Like Gambino, Vito is very cunning.In Puzo\'s novel, Vito is the head of the Corleone crime family, the most powerful Mafia family in the New York City area if not the country. He is depicted as an ambitious Italian immigrant who moves to Hell\'s Kitchen and builds a Mafia empire, yet retains (and strictly adheres to) his own personal code of honor. His youngest son, Michael Corleone, becomes the Don upon his death at the end of the novel. He has two other sons, Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone and Fredo Corleone, and a daughter, Connie Corleone, all of whom play major roles in the story. He also informally adopted another son, Tom Hagen, who grew up to become the Family\'s consigliere.Early lifeIn the chronology of the Godfather saga, Vito first appears in 1901 as a young boy in the small Sicilian town of Corleone. As documented in the novel (and in Godfather Part II), his father, Antonio Andolini, is murdered by the local Mafia boss, Don Ciccio, because he refused to pay tribute to him. His older brother, Paolo, swears revenge, but is himself murdered soon after. Eventually, Ciccio\'s henchmen come to the residence of the Andolinis to take Vito away and have him killed. Desperate, Signora Andolini takes her son to see the mafia chieftain herselfImmigration to AmericaWhen Vito\'s mother goes to see Don Ciccio, she begs him to spare Vito. However, Ciccio refuses, reasoning that Vito would also seek revenge as an adult. Upon Ciccio\'s refusal, Signora Andolini puts a knife to his throat, allowing her son to escape, but is then murdered by Ciccio\'s guards. (In the novel, she survives being shot and later reunites with her son in Sicily many years later.) Later that night, he is smuggled away, fleeing Sicily to seek refuge in America on a cargo ship full of immigrants. In the novel, he deliberately changes his name to Corleone, after his home town. The movie, however, plays that he is renamed ""Vito Corleone"" because the immigration workers at Ellis Island mistake ""Andolini"" for his middle name and the name of his town for his last name. According to The Godfather: Part II, he later adopted the middle name ""Andolini"" to acknowledge his heritage, though this could have been done posthumously by his family.Adopted by the Abbandando familyCorleone is later adopted by the Abbandando family in New York City\'s Hell\'s Kitchen, Manhattan, and he befriends their son, Genco, who becomes like a brother to him. Corleone begins making an honest living at Abbandando\'s grocery store on Ninth Avenue, but loses the job, as an intimidated Abbandando is forced to fire Vito to make room for the nephew of Don Fanucci, a blackhander and the local neighborhood padrone.Corleone soon learns to survive and prosper through petty crime and performing favors in return for loyalty. During this time, he also befriends two other low-level hoods, Peter Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio. In 1919, he commits his first murder, killing Fanucci, who had tried to extort money from him. Corleone chooses the day of a major festival to spy on Fanucci from the rooftops as Fanucci goes home, and surprises him at the door to his apartment. He shoots Fanucci three times, as the din from the festival drowns out the noise from the gunshots.Rise as an olive oil importerAs a young man, Corleone starts an olive oil business, Genco Pura (known as simply Genco Olive Oil in the films) with his friend Genco Abbandando. The company eventually becomes the biggest olive oil importer in the nation. Over the years he uses it as a legal front for his organized crime syndicate, while amassing a fortune with his illegal operations. In 1925, he returns to Sicily for the first time since leaving 24 years earlier. He and his partner, Don Tommasino then set up a meeting with the aging Don Ciccio, where he kills him by carving his stomach open, thus avenging his murdered father, mother and brother.Organized CrimeBy the early 1930s, Vito Corleone has organized his illegal operations as the Corleone crime family. Genco Abbandando becomes his consigliere, or advisor, with Clemenza and Tessio as capo regimes. Later, his son Sonny becomes a capo as well, and eventually his under-boss. Around 1939, he moves his base of operations to Long Beach, on Long Island. While he oversees a business founded on gambling, bootlegging, and union corruption, he is known as a kind, generous man who lives by a strict moral code of loyalty to friends and, above all, family. At the same time, he is known as a traditionalist who demands respect commensurate with his status. By the time of the novel and film, even his three closest friends Genco, Pete and Salnever call him ""Vito,"" but either ""Godfather"" or ""Don Corleone."" In both the book and the first scene of the first Godfather, he chastises his old friend, undertaker Bonasera, for not coming to him first after his daughter is beaten up instead of going to the police. Although he has a reputation for ruthlessness, he disagrees with many of the vicious crimes carried out by gangs and so seeks to control crime in New York by either consuming or eliminating rival gangs. In the mid-1920s, Vito met Hyman Roth (based on real life Jewish mobster Meyer Lansky), who wanted to use Vito\'s trucks for his own smuggling operation. Vito accepted this offer, and the two became allies for many years.Assassination AttemptIn 1945, Corleone is nearly assassinated when he refuses the request of Virgil Sollozzo to invest in a heroin operation and use his political contacts for the operation\'s protection. He is supposed to be driven home by his bodyguard, Paulie Gatto (a soldier in the Clemenza regime) along with his son Fredo. When the Don finds that Paulie is not there, Fredo tells him that Paulie has called in sick that day due to a cold. The Don crosses the street to buy oranges and other fruits from a street vendor. At that time, two of Sollozzo\'s hitmen come out from the shadows with guns drawn. Realizing the situation, the Don tries to sprint back to his Alfa Romeo but he is shot five times in his thighs and arms. Fredo tries to help his father, but fumbles with his gun and can\'t get to him in time.Certain that the Don is dead, Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen and tells him to get Sonny to accept the drug deal. Hagen agrees, but warns Sollozzo that the Don\'s fanatically loyal hitman, Luca Brasi, will likely come after Sollozzo. However, Sollozzo doesn\'t tell Hagen that he helped kill Brasi earlier.Just as Hagen is released, Sollozzo finds out the Don survived. Enraged, he makes a second attempt two days later. The Don is at the French Hospital being guarded by men from Tessio\'s regime. However, Sollozzo has police Captain Mark McCluskey, who has been on the take for many years, threw Tessio\'s men in jail, leaving the Don unguarded. Unfortunately for Sollozzo and McCluskey, Michael comes to visit his father just minutes before the attack is due. Realizing that his father is in danger, Michael has a nurse help him move the Don to another room and pretends to stand guard outside the hospital with Enzo the baker.Injuries from the attack put the Don out of action for next three years. Sonny served as acting head of the family during this time. He determined that Paulie Gatto took money from Sollozzo in return for betraying the Don, and ordered him killed. He also got word that the Tattaglias had killed Luca Brasi, and ordered Tessio\'s men to kill the family\'s underboss, Bruno Tattaglia. Michael persuaded Sonny to allow him to avenge their father by killing Sollozzo and McCluskey himself.Sonny\'s death and Vito\'s returnSonny was himself assassinated, forcing Vito to resume command. He ordered all inquiries made, yet also ordered that no vengeance shall be sought. With the Don incapacitated, the other families had moved in on his business interests, as well as his labor rackets. With the Don\'s return, rival families now started reconsidering their moves.After Sonny\'s funeral and other formalities, Vito ordered Hagen to contact Emilio Barzini, the second most powerful Mafia chieftain in the country, in order to arrange a meeting of heads of all the families in America except the Chicago Outfit (considered the ""black sheep"" of the underworld). The meeting took place in the board room of a Manhattan bank whose president was a close friend of the Corleones.In that meeting, Vito renounced all vengeance regarding his son\'s death. He also said a light yes to the drug operations although he mentioned he never believed in drugs. However, he said he only accepted this for ""selfish reasons"" in order to bring back Michael from exile in Sicily.In this part he said,""But let me say this. I am a superstitious man, a ridiculous failing but I must confess it here. And so if some unlucky accident should befall my youngest son, if some police officer should accidentally shoot him, if he should hang himself while in his jail cell, if new witnesses appear to testify to his guilt, my superstition will make me feel that it was the result of the ill will still borne me by some people here. Let me go further. If my son is struck by a bolt of lightning I will blame some of the people here. If his plane show fall into the sea or his ship sink beneath the waves of the ocean, if he should catch a mortal fever, if his automobile should be struck by a train, such is my superstition that I would blame the ill will felt by people here.""RetirementAfter Michael\'s return from Sicily, Vito installed him in the family business as a learner associate. Michael learned things from his father for more than a year. After Michael\'s marriage with earlier girlfriend Kay Adams, Vito went into semi-retirement. Michael became operating head of the family, with Vito as an informal consigliere. Michael sent Hagen to Las Vegas to act as the family\'s lawyer there and lay the groundwork for a planned move of most operations there after Vito\'s death. Clemenza and Tessio requested permission to break off and form their own families after the move to Las Vegas. Michael\'s bodyguard Albert \'Al\' Neri and Rocco Lampone were chosen to be the future capo regimes of the family. Willi Cicci was also considered, but opted to go with Clemenza\'s planned family.DeathAt the end of the novel and in the movie, he dies of a heart attack while playing with his grandson Anthony in his garden. His last words in the novel are, ""Life is so beautiful."" Vito\'s funeral was a grand affair, with all the other dons, capos and consiglieres in New York attending.Vito told Michael some days before his death that Barzini would set Michael up to be killed under cover of a meeting ""to fix up things."" Barzini would use a trusted member of the Corleone family as an intermediary. At the funeral, Tessio told Michael that he\'d set up a meeting on his territory in Brooklyn, where Michael would presumably be safe. However, Michael had anticipated this and had Tessio killed. Michael then ordered his men to kill Barzini and Tattaglia (in the film, the other two family chiefs as well), thus avenging his father and brother.""']","[[<bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nThis movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather .\nRather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly\ncompliment each other .

The\nacting performances are outstanding, hence three supporting oscar\nnominations for acting guru Lee Strasberg (Hyman Roth), Michael Gazzo (Frank\nPentangeli) and Robert De Niro (young Vito Corleone). Duvall, Keaton, Cazale\nand Shire all provided first rate performances but it is the performance of\nAl Pacino which steals the show, expertly portraying Michael as a cool,\ncalculating, suspicious Don Corleone. The film expands upon the original\nmovie and brings us into the family's activities in Nevada, Florida and\nHavana. Arguably the finest movie of the 70s, a cinematic masterpiece with\nthe greatest ensemble acting you will probably see.   \n</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nCoppola's masterpiece is rivaled only by ""The Godfather, Part II"" in\nwhich the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and\nforwards to reveal the corrupting effect of power...The film,\nbreathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur, shows two parallel\nstories extending two different time periods: the early career of young\nVito Corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in Sicily,\nand then in 1917, building his criminal underworld in the Italian\nghettos of New York City, post World War I, plus that of his son,\nMichael (Al Pacino) desperately trying to keep his family together...<br><br>Al Pacino's performance is quiet and solemn... He is cold and ruthless,\nwith a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we\ninitially met at the beginning of the first film... Here he's a\ncalculating and frightening force, seeking to expand casinos into\nPre-Revolutionary Cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by\nperfidy and treason, maintaining total confidence in his ability to\ncontrol the situation whether testifying before enraging Senators or\ntrying to outface his worst enemies...<br><br>The film's haunting final shot of a lonely, isolated paranoid Michael\nin his empty compound, is an unforgettable movie scene, a tragic\nportrait of a lonely and fully damned person, emotionally empty and\nfinished, far from a waspish wife, more distant from a faithful\nlawyer...<br><br>De Niro's rise, from an orphan child by a family feud back in Italy to\na hood in New York and his position as a respected Don, provides a\nwelcome break from Pacino's relentless attitude... Since the people he\nkills seem to deserve it, Vito comes off better than Michael does, and\nit was wise of Coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite\nlengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuity...<br><br>The entire cast contributes greatly to the success of the film: Lee\nStrasberg, a fascinating mixture of lust and ruthlessness; G. D.\nSpradlin, absolutely right as the sinister and corrupt Nevada Senator;\nMichael V. Gazzo, unforgettable as the troubled gray-haired informer;\nGastone Moschin, excellent as the blackmailer in white suit; John\nCazale, marvelously timid as the vague, confused, and hesitant Fredo;\nDiane Keaton, clearly irrational as the long-suffering wife Kay; Talia\nShire, too extravagant as the lousy mother; Troy Donahue too ambitious\nas the fortune-hunting suitor; and Robert Duvall excels as the\nconfidant, and retainer to the all-powerful Corleone family...<br><br>Coppola's motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters\nand events from the original, it's a far more complex and intimate\nmovie than its predecessor...

The ending by\nfar was my favorite when there all sitting at the table talking. There\nwere so many great scenes like Vito when he was younger, Fredo at the\nlake, and many many more.

This is a direct continuation of that\nstory.<br><br>The good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities,\nincluding fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime,\nunprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since,\nand very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily\nbeen a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't\npossibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets\ntranscend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been\na 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at\nlength, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I\nwould for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather\nPart II is still essential viewing.<br><br>Director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with\nparallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) ""in the\nrole"" of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film,\naccepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like\nthe first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know\nsome of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps\na bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after\nall, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The\nGodfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario\nPuzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.<br><br>After the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we\nquickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia\nworld. Michael believes that someone on the ""inside"" was involved with\nthe hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has\nMichael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New\nYork, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the\nattempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all\nbeen part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one\nof the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's\nunderlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not\nthrough his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it\nstarts to feel like slightly muddled writing.<br><br>During the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also\nhave a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast.\nThere are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or\nexplained. You may need to keep a scorecard.<br><br>Coppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended ""flashback"" segments,\nand I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert\nDe Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although\nmaybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.<br><br>But let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe\nfirst evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far\ntoo long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of\neither the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to\nfeel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the\ntrack that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have\nbeen a solid 10.<br><br>There's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola\nappears to have been suffering from what I'd now call ""J.K. Rowling\nSyndrome"". That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that\nthey can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice\nabout where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it\nin, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more\nsensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat,\nincluding much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the\ntable with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold\ntelephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and\nprovide the dramatic points), and so on.<br><br>The film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show\nthat Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a\ncollection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that\nneeded to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the\nclimax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this\nis especially clear in the d\xe9nouement, which seems to just end.<br><br>I've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first\none, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad\nperformance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor\ncharacters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John\nCazale, really stand out.<br><br>The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the\nbeautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production\ndesign is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit\nscenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness,\nand everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange.\nAmazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly\ndifficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't\nremember another film since that has been able to capture the same\nlook. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors,\ncreating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.<br><br>Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus\non most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that,\nand the film's importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a\nmust-see.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nThe Godfather Part Two is possibly the best film ever made, every part\nof this film is amazing, it is even better than the original, I was\nvery surprised by this.

While the\nfirst is arguably the greatest film ever made, the second installment is\neasily the best sequel produced hands down. The film is split between the\nstories of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino, Oscar-nominated) and a young Vito\nCorleone (Robert De Niro, in his star-making, first Oscar-winning\nperformance). In the 1950s, Michael is trying to expand his crime empire to\nlocales such as Las Vegas, Hollywood, and even turbulent Cuba. However,\nthere are numerous problems as older brother Fredo (John Cazale) may have\ndouble-crossed the family. Also two prominent crime bosses pose a\nconsiderable threat as well (Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo, both\nOscar-nominated). Younger sister Connie (Oscar nominee Talia Shire) is still\nreeling from her husband's murder and her father's death at the conclusion\nof the original film. Michael is also distancing himself from his wife\n(Diane Keaton) and some of his most trusted friends (Robert Duvall). While\nall this is occurring we get glimpses into the early life of Michael's\nfather (De Niro). We learn that his parents and older brother have been\nkilled in early-1900s Sicily and that he has immigrated to New York. Vito\npays his dues and learns the tricks of the trade, buying his time, before\ndeciding to create his own small empire which would of course grow and\nbecome what we saw in the original. It would seem that the film would be\nconfusing by jumping back and forth between Michael and his father, but that\nis not so. Coppola gives you just enough information to keep the audience\nintrigued through each segment. The film is very well-made and runs very\nsmoothly even though it lasts over 200 minutes. Many think that this\ninstallment is the best of the series. Even though I still think that the\noriginal is the best, I cannot totally disagree with this assertion as this\nis the definitive sequel. 5 stars out of 5.   \n</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nTo me and probably to many other people The Godfather Part II is more\nof a continuation than sequel to The Godfather. Just look at the IMDb\nrating and you'll see I'm not the only one who feels this way. To me it\nas good as the first.<br><br>The acting may have been better than the acting in the original. Robert\nDe Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His\nportrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I\ndefinitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he\nwas in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his\ncareer. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito\nCorleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a\nvery strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see\nmore of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences\nof certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought\nand struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the\nway it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton\nwas not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she\nis very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands\nbehind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is\nwilling to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to\nme was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes\nyou feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in\nthe first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed\nout. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but\nin The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such\nextraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine\nperformance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played\nyoung Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a\ncharacter study than the original.<br><br>The directing once again is perfect. Francis Ford Coppola know or at\nleast knew how to make a movie. The first to Godfather movie are done\nso precisely and perfectly that nothing really sticks out because they\nare so perfect throughout. Coppola just lets his actors play everything\nout as he should with type of cast he has here. Not to many movies can\nmaintain such a consistent flow over 3 hours let alone even an hour and\n45 minutes.<br><br>The writing may not have been quite as good as the first in terms of\nquoting but the storyline was perfect. Seeing the decisions made by new\nmob boss Michael Corleone was common sense but flashing back on Vito\nCorleone's life was genius. The storyline to me could not have been\nbetter and Coppola and Puzo do a great job with it all the way.<br><br>Like the first the cinematography was amazing but it had a slightly\ndifferent tone to it. The first had more of a majestic, mythical look\nto it. In Part II you feel the modern times creeping in and the\nCorleones having to adjust to it. Part II has more of a corrupt and\nevil twist to it but I guess the end signifies that. The music\nobviously the same as the first was perfect and just fit so greatly\nwith the rest of the movie.<br><br>The first to movies of The Godfather series are really like the same\nmovie. They are not the same though, they are actually very different\nbut the greatness of them both and the continuation of the storyline\nfrom the first to the second really create a strong band between each\nother. To me it is only a sequel in that it was the second movie of a\ngreat series. No let downs, no disappointments just a continuation of\nof the greatness from the first one.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nThis sequel is just as terrific as the first film, if not more so. I\nhesitate to call it a sequel, as ""sequel"" is quite simply the wrong\nword I am looking for. A film like ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is a sequel -\n""The Godfather Part II"" is something more. It's just too good to be\ncalled a sequel.<br><br>The film won six Oscars in 1974, including Best Picture and Best\nSupporting Actor (Robert De Niro). It deserved every one. It involves\nthe viewer from the start and never lets up. Particular aspects I enjoy\nin this film are the flashbacks to Don Vito Corleone as a child\nimmigrating to New York City after social problems in his homeland,\nSicily. I like the intertwining of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), his\nson, in present day, dealing with his crime inheritance, and Vito\n(Robert De Niro), his father, years ago. I like how, as Michael comes\nto terms with his family legacy, the film shows us Vito coming to terms\nwith his future. The day he shoots that man in a gritty apartment\ncomplex is a turning point in his life. <br><br>Every actor is in top form here. Al Pacino has gradually made the move\nfrom a man who denies his future to a man who is accepting it. His\ncharacter is the spotlight of this film, much more so than in the first\nfilm (though both center around his decisions).<br><br>Robert De Niro is particularly wonderful and convincing as a young Vito\nCorleone, who was of course played by the constantly-spoofed Marlon\nBrando in the original. De Niro takes an iron grip on his character and\ncompletely engulfs himself; this was, in 1974, the sign of an actor who\nwould go places. Indeed, he did.<br><br>Coppola's magical sense of direction is at work here, as is the script\nby Coppola and Mario Puzo (whose novels the series is based upon). The\noriginal was a wonderful film, but the sequel presents more of a\nchallenge. Flashbacks are often intercut in the middle of other films\nare awkward times, but in ""The Godfather Part II,"" Coppola uses them at\nprecisely the right moments, managing to careen in and out of scenes\nand time periods with free abandon.<br><br>It takes a great kind of skill to master something like this, much less\na sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time. ""The Godfather""\nwas an instant classic upon its release in 1972. Coppola had two years\nto plan for his continuation of the film. People told him it wouldn't\nwork, he would never beat the original, and he would never pull it off.\nBut he showed them all. ""The Godfather Part II"" may well be the best\nsequel I have ever seen in my entire lifetime. I wish they were all\nthis good. To call it a ""sequel"" almost seems insulting.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nSpoilers Ahead:<br><br>I, myself, prefer the original but this is a fantastic sequel but much\ndarker. Many were annoyed at the temporal juxtaposition of Vito and\nMichael. Believe me, nobody hates temporal jumping back and forth than\nmore I do but it is used by Coppola for dramatic contrast. What you\nwill notice is what we knew about Michael already: The Outsider. From\nthe first, in The Godfather, he sits at the farthest periphery of the\nfamily, on the outskirts on the family. This is an existential metaphor\nfor Michael himself. He is barely in the family, just barely. My\nfavorite scene contains the essence to understanding Michael versus the\nfamily Patriarch Vito. At the end, after having Fredo shot, we see a\nflashback where Sonny, Hagen, Fredo are all sitting at the table\nwaiting for Vito's birthday cake. When Michael tells them he has defied\nVito and enlisted for WW2, Sonny has to be restrained from kicking the\ncrap out of him. Watch Michael's contempt for Hagen, ""You talked to my\nfather about my future?"" Then, they all file out leaving Michael alone\nin the room; fade back to the future. Coppola zooms in on Michael's\nface, half of it goes into total darkness. Get the Message? He is not\nin the family; he is a loner. The darkness is his personality; he is\nmuch more evil and ruthless than Vito.<br><br>Vito always had Fredo out of the picture somewhere, drive the car,\nlater he sends him to Vegas to keep him away from messing up the family\nbusiness. Michael will not tolerate his dangerous stupidity. Watch the\ncontempt when Fredo lectures Michael on how he wants respect and he has\nbeen passed over. This after almost getting Michael killed twice once\nin his house, the other time in Cuba. This is the reason for going back\nand forth. Coppola wants you to see that Vito is plenty ruthless, in\nthe killing of Fannuci, and returning for vengeance to Sicily. But Vito\nis the family patriarch, he simply could not kill Carlo in the\noriginal. He retired and made Michael do it. The bad news is that\nMichael changed from that experience. He waits to kill Fredo, just like\nhe did for Carlo in the original. His coldness darkens the film deeply.<br><br>His cruelty to Kay, Connie, Fredo, even his own children, closing the\nkitchen door on her while turning and glaring at his children is not a\npretty sight. The man is nothing like Vito. We see Vito making friends\nwith Clemenza and Tessio, using his influence to protect Signora who\nhas been ejected with her children into the street. He has a warmth and\ncaring underneath all the evil and power on the surface. Michael\nCorleone is a walking iceberg; pure cold ruthless evil devoid of all\nforgiveness. He seeks explanation for his deviation from his mother,\nshe tells him he can never lose his family. Michael blames the times,\nwrong, he is not Vito; also, he never really was nor wanted to be in\nthis family. Vito's near assassination, in the original, sucked him\ninto the family business. He came in but he retains his contempt and\nicy separation. Watch him turn on Hagen,""Are you coming with me on\nthis, otherwise you can take your wife and your mistress and leave.""\nThis is the difference; Kay is not Mama Coreleone to him; she is a baby\nmachine to produce heirs. This is a great movie, I simply find the\ndepth of his evil darkens the movie considerably.<br><br>Michael's killing of Fredo is not an anomaly. The man kills anyone he\nperceives to be a threat or an enemy. Hagen triggers him by saying the\ntruth,""You've won, is it necessary to wipe everyone out?"" Vito would\nnot have, Michael changed when he killed Carlo in the original. Fredo\npays the price; he is cold as a serial killer. A great movie, it is in\nmy inventory; I must admit I rarely watch it, too ugly and depressing.\nBoth of these are worth owning, the third one is a total piece of crap\nand an insult to these two.

This is\nthe only film that delivers both. I loved the first Godfather film, for it's\nacting talent, for it's cinematography, and for it's fantastic story. The\nacting is every bit as great, and the cinematography is about as good, but\nthe story wasn't exactly as good as the first; had it not been for the\nflashbacks that showed Vito as young(beautifully portrayed by De Niro), it\nwouldn't have gotten a perfect rating from me. He saved the film, that was\notherwise slow and a little bland, due to the story not being as great as\nthe first. The first showed us a mafia war; this just shows the aftermath,\nand Michael Corleone's further rise to power, after the fall of Vito in the\nfirst. However, the film has a number of flashbacks, that show us Vito as\nyoung, and here De Niro perfectly shows us the entire range of his talents,\nby mimicking Brando's performance to perfection. The plot is good, but not\nas good as the first; it's saved by the flashback sequences that show us how\nand why Vito Corleone came to power. The acting is every bit as great as the\nfirst. Al Pacino still gives a great performance, like he did in the first,\nand the other cast members who came back from the first, including Robert\nDuvall and Diane Keaton, also give as great performances as they did in the\nfirst. The new actors also give great performances, though the following\nstand out as the best; Robert De Niro, Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo.\nThe characters are as well-written as they were in the first. The mafia is\nportrayed as menacingly in this as it was in the first. The film, like the\nfirst, has it's share of memorable quotes, but not really any scenes that\nwere memorable, like the first one had. All in all, a great film, but mainly\nbecause of De Niro and Pacino. De Niro fills Brando's part fairly well, but\noverall, the film isn't as entertaining and exciting as the first, though it\ndoes reach about the same quality overall.

The movie gave Pacino his third consecutive Oscar\nnomination and a perpetual stardom that catapulted him above the ruck,\nlaying the foundations of his illustrious career.

The\nsynergy imparted by the brilliance of these two outstanding performers,\nmakes the movie, a treat to watch.

Only the hit on Michael's house,\nand the build up for young Vito's story was what makes you interested.\nThe rest is just anti-climatic and dull. The dialogs weren't as\nquotable or stand alone as in the first. I thought as a sad imitation\nof the real thing.<br><br>Al Pacino's performance was absolutely superb. The problem wasn't that.\nThe whole character was what failed. In the first, we get the glimpse\nof a warm man, but gets cold when is needed. A man who thinks before he\ntalks. In this one, we see a man who is cold and heartless every single\ntime you see him. He no longer has the eminence that Vito Corleone once\nhad. The previous Don was eminent and even though he could scare the\nhell out of you with his stare, you respected and looked up to him.\nNow, his son is just pure evil. And that doesn't make sense. In the\nbook, it's clear that Michael is the living image of his father. So,\nwhat happened? Him killing Fredo was completely useless. Even if he did\nbetray him, there was no need to have him whacked. A Don just doesn't\nkill anyone from his own family (not ""the Family"", the real one). I\nknow, Michael did kill Carlo, but let's remember he was not really\nfamily, just an in-law, and he did deserve what was coming. Another\nthing I personally hated was what happened to Connie. As you will see\nin the third, she radically changes from the naive Don's daughter to...\nSorry, wrong movie. Anyway, all the other aspects, (filmmaking, score,\nperformances, photography)were indeed flawless. <br><br>It's interesting. You can perfectly notice Coppola's anatomy for each\n""Godfather"". You start with a prologue, then a religious ceremony\nand/or a party afterward, the plot then starts and a pivotal point is a\nhit on the Don. The rest is a slow, yet properly thought vengeance that\nends with a gigantic and operatic blood bath. However, for part II, it\nwasn't's that operatic or with the same effect than part I. It was\nanti-climatic, and pretty disappointing.<br><br>Another flaw I found was that the story doesn't really stick to the\nbook. One key aspect in the film didn't even appear in Mario Puzo's\nnovel: Vito Corleone never returned to Sicily. The name of the Don who\nhad his family killed doesn't even matter. Still, the scene prominently\nexplains Don Tomassino's condition from the first.<br><br>Now, don't get me wrong. I'm a die hard fan of ""The Godfather"". I\nconsider it to be the best movie ever (and the best novel ever, too).\nBut part II just doesn't do it for me.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nSequel to the original Godfather is slower moving than the original but\nmaybe better. The first was fresh material and Brando's presence was a\nhuge plus. But this one digs into the blood and guts of the two main\ncharacters, provoking more thought, as well as introducing us to one of\nthe most prolific actors today.<br><br>Michael's descent into darkness is terrible to behold. Tragedy\nsurrounds him as he struggles to maintain his empire but alienates\nhimself in the process. Hey, it's not easy holding a crime empire\ntogether. I think this film sets out to make Michael a tragic figure\nbut how do you feel sympathy for a guy who murders family members? It's\na cold world obviously, and takes a strong man to stay on top. Very\ninteresting final scene, grim and stark, as Michael sits contemplating\non a chair watching the dead leaves blow around him.<br><br>Pacino's performance is magnificent. Some great scenes, especially when\nMichael realizes Fredo betrayed him. That simple movement of covering\nhis forehead in shock and despair conveys so much. Michael becomes a\nthree dimensional character in this film as opposed to the first.\nPacino just nails the part.<br><br>The secondary story is the rise of Michael's father, Vito Corleone and\nwe watch the birth of a star. DeNiro even surpasses Pacino in his part,\nif that is possible. The calculating Vito as he calmly stalks Don\nFanucci from the rooftops is classic film. DeNiro plays the role of\nDeath himself: knife thin, pale yet slick and immaculate in appearance.\nHow many other hit men in the movies borrowed DeNiro's look? <br><br>What the Godfather does, unlike so many other films of it's generation\nis convey thought in simple movements. Watch DeNiro as he pales\nvisibly, staring at an old Italian remedy of his sick baby. We know\nright then that Vito Corleone will do whatever it takes to protect and\nsave his family. Watch him as Don Fanucci boards his car and leans on\nhim. By DeNiro's expression, we know Fanucci is already a dead man.\nThat's unsurpassed acting.<br><br>The sets are beautiful to behold and this is probably the best\ncinematography I have seen in any movie. Early 1900's New York, in the\nItalian neighborhood is unreal. Watch the pedestrians and background\nmovement while the focus of the scene is occurring. That's sheer magic.\nOnce again, watch Hyman Roth in Cuba lie on the couch, shirtless and a\ngentle wind moving the drapes. We can practically feel the heat and\nhear and smell the city of Havana. It made me think how much care and\ncalculation was put into this movie.<br><br>Some weak points: Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth was not on par with the\nother actors. Gazzo as Pentangeli just grated on my nerves, especially\nin the first hour. I was hoping he would get whacked so he would not\nappear in the rest of the film. The rest of the cast is great as usual,\nespecially Duvall and Kirby. Not much to complain about.<br><br>The second Godfather, tries to do what the first does, a study of Vito\nvs. Michael. They both have different motivations for ruling their\nempire. Whereas Vito tries to do whatever it takes to rise from poverty\nand provide for his family out of love, Michael rules out of\nruthlessness and a need to succeed to maintain his empire. You can see\nwhere the results have taken both.<br><br>One of the greatest films of all time.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nThe sequel to ""The Godfather,"" at times, was just as impressive, and\nsometimes even more impressive than the original. Overall, though the\nfilm struggles with it's flashbacks to an early New York as we watch a\nyoung Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), rise to power. ""The Godfather\nII,"" wants to be both a prequel and sequel at the same time. When we're\nin the present time watching Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) fight off\nSenators that are trying to squeeze him, or when we're watching his\nhouse get shot up on an assassination attempt that involved someone\nvery close to the family we always find our self in amazement. When we\njump back in time, you get a feeling of intrusion. The script is to\nblame because its too bloated, and wants to accomplish so much in it's\nnear three hour run time. When we're in the early 1920s we see things\nthat are entertaining and gratifying, but ultimately not even close to\nbeing on par with the present day status of the Corleone family. Its\ngood to know and see how the godfather started out, but there's too\nmuch to say and not enough time to say it. The bloated section of the\nfilm becomes underwritten. We don't really learn anything about Vito\nCorleone that we didn't already know. We don't really see how he gains\nhis power. He kills ""The Black Hand,"" and one day, through rumors, he\nbecomes the Don of the city. Just like that. Just like that? Really?\nThen we come back and he's all of a sudden in the Olive Oil business.\nWe don't know how he got there or anything, he's just there. De Niro\ngives it his best, but he's just not working with anything to give any\nkind of performance that's remotely on the same level as Brando did in\nthe previous film. I found it painful to watch De Niro try to imitate\nBrando. <br><br>When we see the city, it does have a good look to it, and its\nconvincing as the set and costumes designs, along with the art\ndirection, are very good. We never see big wide shots of the city\nblock. We see a lot of people and grocery stores go by the quickly\nmoving camera. Coppola does an excellent job of not pulling back too\nfar (Probably didn't have the budget to make a huge set of the city),\nbut we get a claustrophobic sensation. The kind of claustrophobic\nsensation where a guy right next door, in the next building, is close\nenough to stick his head out the window, call for you, and hand you a\nsack full of guns. Coppola encapsulates the city, and the time very\nwell. There are some great moments in the flashbacks, but I could have\nlived without it entirely, and probably would have watched a much\nbetter film (Possibly better than the original). <br><br>When Michael finds that his own brother, Fredo (John Cazel), knew about\nthe assassination attempt on his life, and that he was involved and\nthat he never told Michael about his connection with Hymen Roth and\nJohnny Ola, it infuriates Michael to the point of no return. He feels\nas though he loses his family. When he confronts Fredo, he doesn't say\nmuch; he's sick of him; Fredo's too stupid to have around, and he can't\neven look at him. Coppola' direction here is magnificent. Even though\nits dark and you can't see the reactions of both of the men, they're\nboth in the picture with the light shinning through the windows\ncreating silhouettes of the men that were, and we see their body\nlanguage, and the body language tells us everything we need to know.<br><br>Cazel gives a great performance throughout the entire film, and we wish\nwe got to see more from his character. He's so good in this one scene\nthat it stands as one of the best scenes in film history, and a huge\npart of that is due to him. The words that come out of his mouth are on\npar with Marlon Brando' speech in, ""On the Waterfront."" All this\nfrustration, years of it, just boil over to point of pity. He's\npleading with his brother. We watch him spill his guts on the table,\nand admit that he's well aware of being stupid and feeding into that\nstereotype as he watches his younger brother give him orders we feel\nhis pain and frustration for not living up to the coldness and\ncallousness of his family. He feels like an outsider, a coward, and a\nloser. All the while, Michael sits in front of the window looking at\nthe boathouse. He doesn't care what Fredo has to say, which makes it\nall that more painful to watch for the both of them. Michael wants\ninformation from him, and that's it. One feels like an outsider, and\none is an outsider. Neither of them fit in this lifestyle, but it ruins\nboth of their lives. Fredo wants respect and power. Michael has the\npower, but no respect, and finds out that he loses everything that he\never cared about: his family. Its one of the most powerful scenes in\ncinematic history.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n""The Godfather: Part II"" hit theatres a couple of years after the first\nfilm and made history by becoming the first sequel to win the Academy\nAward for Best Picture.

Michael\nis firmly established as the head of the family and has moved to Nevada\nwhere he is edging the family towards legitimacy.

His mother was a circus performer and his father, who was born in South Africa, was a commercial pilot. The family lived in different countries throughout Bale\'s childhood, including England, Portugal, and the United States. Bale acknowledges the constant change was one of the influences on his career choice.His first acting job was a cereal commercial in 1983; amazingly, the next year, he debuted on the West End stage in ""The Nerd"". A role in the 1986 NBC mini-series Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna (1986) caught Steven Spielberg\'s eye, leading to Bale\'s well-documented role in Empire of the Sun (1987). For the range of emotions he displayed as the star of the war epic, he earned a special award by the National Board of Review for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor.Adjusting to fame and his difficulties with attention (he thought about quitting acting early on), Bale appeared in Kenneth Branagh\'s 1989 adaptation of Shakespeare\'s Henry V (1989) and starred as Jim Hawkins in a TV movie version of Treasure Island (1990). Bale worked consistently through the 1990s, acting and singing in Newsies (1992), Swing Kids (1993), Little Women (1994), The Portrait of a Lady (1996), The Secret Agent (1996), Metroland (1997), Velvet Goldmine (1998), All the Little Animals (1998), and A Midsummer Night\'s Dream (1999). Toward the end of the decade, with the rise of the Internet, Bale found himself becoming one of the most popular online celebrities around, though he, with a couple notable exceptions, maintained a private, tabloid-free mystique.Bale roared into the next decade with a lead role in American Psycho (2000), director Mary Harron\'s adaptation of the controversial Bret Easton Ellis novel. In the film, Bale played a murderous Wall Street executive obsessed with his own physicality - a trait for which Bale would become a specialist. Subsequently, the 10th Anniversary issue for ""Entertainment Weekly"" crowned Bale one of the ""Top 8 Most Powerful Cult Figures"" of the past decade, citing his cult status on the Internet. EW also called Bale one of the ""Most Creative People in Entertainment"", and ""Premiere"" lauded him as one of the ""Hottest Leading Men Under 30"".Bale was truly on the Hollywood radar at this time, and he turned in a range of performances in the remake Shaft (2000), Captain Corelli\'s Mandolin (2001), the balmy Laurel Canyon (2002), and Reign of Fire (2002), a dragons-and-magic commercial misfire that has its share of defenders.Two more cult films followed: Equilibrium (2002) and The Machinist (2004), the latter of which gained attention mainly due to Bale\'s physical transformation - he dropped a reported 60+ pounds for the role of a lathe operator with a secret that causes him to suffer from insomnia for over a year.Bale\'s abilities to transform his body and to disappear into a character influenced the decision to cast him in Batman Begins (2005), the first chapter in Christopher Nolan\'s definitive trilogy that proved a dark-themed narrative could resonate with audiences worldwide. The film also resurrected a character that had been shelved by Warner Bros. after a series of demising returns, capped off by the commercial and critical failure of Batman & Robin (1997). A quiet, personal victory for Bale: he accepted the role after the passing of his father in late 2003, an event that caused him to question whether he would continue performing.Bale segued into two indie features in the wake of Batman\'s phenomenal success: The New World (2005) and Harsh Times (2005). He continued working with respected independent directors in 2006\'s Rescue Dawn (2006), Werner Herzog\'s feature version of his earlier, Emmy-nominated documentary, Little Dieter Needs to Fly (1997). Leading up to the second Batman film, Bale starred in The Prestige (2006), the remake of 3:10 to Yuma (2007), and a reunion with director Todd Haynes in the experimental Bob Dylan biography, I\'m Not There. (2007).Anticipation for The Dark Knight (2008) was spun into unexpected heights with the tragic passing of Heath Ledger, whose performance as The Joker became the highlight of the sequel. Bale\'s graceful statements to the press reminded us of the days of the refined Hollywood star as the second installment exceeded the box-office performance of its predecessor.Bale\'s next role was the eyebrow-raising decision to take over the role of John Connor in the Schwarzenegger-less Terminator Salvation (2009), followed by a turn as federal agent Melvin Purvis in Michael Mann\'s Public Enemies (2009). Both films were hits but not the blockbusters they were expected to be.For all his acclaim and box-office triumphs, Bale would earn his first Oscar in 2011 in the wake of The Fighter (2010)\'s critical and commercial success. Bale earned the Best Supporting Actor award for his portrayal of Dicky Eklund, brother to and trainer of boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward, played by Mark Wahlberg. Bale again showed his ability to reshape his body with another gaunt, skeletal transformation.Bale then turned to another auteur, Yimou Zhang, for the epic Jin ling shi san chai (2011), in which Bale portrayed a priest trapped in the midst of the Rape of Nanking. Bale earned headlines for his attempt to visit with Chinese civil-rights activist Chen Guangcheng, which was blocked by the Chinese government.Bale capped his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Dark Knight Rises (2012); in the wake of the Aurora, Colorado tragedy, Bale made a quiet pilgrimage to the state to visit with survivors of the attack that left theatergoers dead and injured. He also starred in the thriller Out of the Furnace (2013) with Crazy Heart (2009) writer/director Scott Cooper, and the drama-comedy American Hustle (2013), reuniting with David O. Russell.Bale will re-team with The New World (2005) director Terrence Malick for two upcoming projects: Knight of Cups (2015) and an as-yet-untitled drama.In his personal life, he devotes time to charities including Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Foundation. He lives with his wife, Sibi Blazic, and their daughter, Emmeline.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Anonymous          Spouse (1) Sibi Blazic (29 January\xa02000            - present)\xa0(2 children)          Trade Mark (9)        Often portrays obsessive and detached or loner characters        Frequently works with directors Christopher Nolan, Terrence Malick and David O.

Consequently, was noted by the media as the first star of American Psycho (2000), only to lose the role to Leonardo DiCaprio and then win it back again.      Is an excellent horseman and an avid reader.      He trained for 10 weeks in dancing and martial arts for the dance sequences in Newsies (1992) and Swing Kids (1993).      He has an uncanny ear for accents.      Bale was handpicked by Winona Ryder for the coveted role of Laurie (Theodore Laurence) in Little Women (1994).      His father, David Bale, married feminist icon Gloria Steinem on September 3, 2000.      A devoted animal lover, Christian has two dogs [Mojo and Ramone] and three cats [Miriam, Molly and Lilly], which are all strays that he found.      Christian is active in many organizations, including Ark Trust, Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Foundation, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, the Redwings Sanctuary, and the Happy Child Mission, and a school for street kids in Rio De Janeiro.      His grandfather doubled for John Wayne in two movies, in Africa.      His first on-screen role was in 1983 at age 9 in a British commercial for Pac-Man cereal.      He replaced Leonardo DiCaprio for the film American Psycho (2000).      His father, David Bale, died on December 30, 2003, from brain lymphoma at age 62.      He was raised in England, Portugal and California.      His great-uncle, Rex Bale, was an actor.      His father was a former commercial pilot and his mother was a former circus dancer.      Has three sisters: musician Erin Bale; computer professional Sharon Bale; and director/actress Louise Bale, who appeared in Newsies (1992).      His grandfather was a stand-up comic and children\'s entertainer.      Met his wife through Winona Ryder; she was Ryder\'s personal assistant.      With Batman Begins (2005), he has become the seventh actor to play Batman/Bruce Wayne in a live-action film. The others were: Lewis Wilson in 1943, Robert Lowery in 1949, Adam West in 1966, Michael Keaton for the first two installments of the Batman film series, to be replaced by Val Kilmer and George Clooney.      Dropped an amazing 63 pounds for his role as the emaciated insomniac Trevor Reznik in the film The Machinist (2004) with only a single vitamin consultation with a nutritionist to guide him. For the most part, he only ate salads and apples, chewed gum, smoked cigarettes, and drank nonfat lattes.      Considered getting formal acting training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) when he was twenty, but decided to focus on working instead.      Has been in two versions of the John Smith/Pocahontas story. He provides the voice of Thomas in Pocahontas (1995) and plays John Rolfe in The New World (2005).      Turned down the opportunity to reprise the role of Patrick Bateman in the Roger Avary-directed The Rules of Attraction (2002).      In the ""Fresh Air with Terry Gross"" radio interview first aired June 13, 2005, he admitted to Gross that because Batman is ""such an American icon"", he had decided not to perform his promotional interviews for the movie Batman Begins (2005) in his natural English accent. Instead he spoke to Gross in an almost inflection-less mid-American accent, only revealing his dialectic roots with a few words.      Two of his most famous characters\' names have a difference of only one letter: Bateman and Batman.      Since a young age, he was very ambitious about attending Drama School, and auditioned for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), and the Central School of Speech and Drama at age 20. He was accepted to all, but was convinced by his parents to continue working instead. To this day, he regrets not attending drama school for his personal passion of learning his craft.      The nameplate on his trailer for Batman Begins (2005) read ""Bruce Wayne"" as opposed to Bale\'s name.      Is the first non-American actor to portray Batman/Bruce Wayne.      Is the youngest actor to portray Batman.      Owned a home he shared with his sister, Louise Bale, in Manhattan Beach.      Before he played Batman in Batman Begins (2005), his sister Louise Bale played Batman\'s mother in The Death of Batman (2003).      Auditioned for the role of Jack Dawson in Titanic (1997) and almost got the role but people felt that it wouldn\'t be ""fair"" having two Brits playing two Americans (Rose was American as well, she says in the movie that the Titanic was a slave ship bring her back to America).      Was considered for the role of Will Turner in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), which went to Orlando Bloom.      Is a distant relative of 19th-century thespian Lily Langtry.      If he plays an American character, he will use an American accent in all the interviews related to the film. He says he does this so the audience is not confused.      Became a father for the 1st time at age 31 when his wife Sibi Blazic gave birth to their daughter Emmaline Bale on March 27, 2005.      Chosen by Empire magazine as one of the 100 Sexiest Stars in film history (#13) (2007).      Although born in Wales, his family is actually English. In 1976, when Bale was two years old, his family left Wales and returned to England.      Was good friends with the late actor Heath Ledger.      His fans refer to themselves as ""Baleheads"".      His father was an activist and adventurer and his mother a circus dancer so he never lived in one place for very long while growing up.      A very private individual, he has never publicly confirmed the name of his daughter.      Beat out nearly 4,000 other auditions for the role of Jim Graham in Steven Spielberg\'s Empire of the Sun (1987).      Was introduced to acting by his sister, Louise Bale.      Alongside Michael Keaton, he is the only other actor to portray Bruce Wayne/Batman in more than one live action film.      Took up vegetarianism at the age of six but has since returned to eating meat.      Was arrested over verbal assault allegations made by his mother and his sister just hours after he attended the European premiere of his movie The Dark Knight (2008) in London. Upon reviewing the case, the London police decided not to charge him with anything. [July 2008]      While working on Schindler\'s List (1993), Steven Spielberg paid a visit to Bale on the set of Swing Kids (1993), as both movies were partially filmed in Prague.      Was considered for the role of James Bond in Casino Royale (2006), which went to Daniel Craig.      Has said that he considers it an honor to have been called a ""mofo"" by Samuel L. Jackson in a movie.      He and his wife belong to the Board of Trustees in the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International.      Dislikes doing interviews.      Met Drew Barrymore on the set of Empire of the Sun (1987), who was visiting her godfather, Steven Spielberg. He was thirteen and she was twelve. They would both admit later to having a crush on each other at the time.      He was involved in an infamous incident where he was recorded verbally assaulting cinematographer Shane Hurlbut on the set of Terminator Salvation (2009) for interrupting him during an intense scene. Bale has since apologized, but the incident was widely heard across the Internet.      Is an avid fan of video games and cites Super Mario as one of his all-time favorites growing up.

He was considered for the role of Norman Bates in Psycho (1998) before Vince Vaughn was cast.Personal Quotes (64)      [interview in Spin magazine, March 1996] An actor should never be larger than the film he\'s in.      [on dealing with the resulting media attention of Empire of the Sun (1987) at age 13] It was horrific. I was almost crying in interviews and running away during press conferences, pretending I was going to the bathroom and just disappearing.      [on the sudden fame that resulted after Empire of the Sun (1987)] I enjoyed making the film, but I was shocked when I received all the attention when I got home to Bournemouth. Girls were all over me, boys wanted to fight me, and I was being asked to open local f\xeates when all I wanted to do was ride my BMX bike in the woods. I told my parents I wasn\'t interested in doing anything again because the attention ruined it.      I don\'t want to know about the lives of other actors and I don\'t want people to know too much about me. If we don\'t know about the private lives of other actors, that leaves us as clean slates when it comes to playing characters. That\'s the point, they can create these other characters and I can believe them. I think if you\'re a good enough actor, that\'s the way to longevity in the film business. Keep everybody guessing.      I started my career without fans.      [on his 63-pound weight loss for The Machinist (2004)] I had a stupid kind of feeling of invincibility, like, ""I can do it, I can manage it."" I really did feel like I hit this point of enlightenment.      I always like that. Whenever there\'s a project where everyone\'s going, ""Oooooh, it\'s a bit dodgy"", I always like it. If you actually look at it, there tends not to be anything risky at all. Why did I start acting in the first place? I didn\'t do it to be mediocre or to please everybody all the time.      I\'d love to remain a secret and still work, but I also want people to see the movies I\'m in and get a higher profile because of that. I like to think that as long as you continue choosing diverse roles, you can avoid becoming predictable.      It\'s the actors who are prepared to make fools of themselves who are usually the ones who come to mean something to the audience.      [on his transformation into Patrick Bateman for American Psycho (2000)] The character is so vain and obsessed with his looks. While the psychology of the character was something that I could perform, you can\'t fake the physicality. Being English, I tend to enjoy going down to the pub far more than going to the gym, so it was very unnatural for me. I just had to convince myself that I loved it, which was the most difficult thing about playing this part. Working out is incredibly boring. I swear it\'s true that the bigger your muscles get, the fewer brain cells you have. I found I had to stop thinking when I was in the gym because if I thought about it, I\'d realize how ridiculous it was that I was pumping iron when I could\'ve been out having a drink and a cigarette and enjoying some lunch. I did three hours a day for six weeks with a personal trainer and some time before that. I ate an awful lot during training and then almost nothing during filming.      The only thing that I\'m obsessed with is sleeping and, actually, it is more than an obsession, it is a pleasure. I love sleeping so much that I could do it 12 hours a day if I didn\'t have to turn on the alarm clock... and still, sometimes...      Our Batman [Batman Begins (2005)] is centered on the early days. It\'s an explanation. It\'s certainly not Batman No. 5. It\'s a reinvention. We want you to forget there has ever been a Batman before this one.      [on Batman Begins (2005)] I\'ve never felt like the Batman character in the films was given as much time as any of the villains. The villains were always the most interesting characters, too. Batman has always been this very bizarre, almost blind character running through the middle of the story. Our film is different.      [on Batman Begins (2005)] I contacted them. I heard they were doing some low-budget Batman not aimed at kids and I was tantalized. I had appreciated the Batman movies, but I wasn\'t really a fan and I didn\'t know the TV series. But I read some of the graphic novels, and they were very dark and very interesting.      I spent about three weeks in Chicago last July doing night shoots [for Batman Begins (2005)]. It\'s a great city, but the humidity was tough under the Batsuit. Uh, it got a little bad. It\'s hot enough in the Batsuit, let alone in the Chicago heat.      I needed money because I had just bought a house, but I just kept saying, ""I really can\'t do another movie that I know is not going to turn out the way I want it to, and that I have to make a lot of concessions in my head for."".      For me, there\'s a bigger risk trying [Batman Begins (2005)]. Ultimately, the big point was that [Christopher Nolan], who you would not expect to be doing that kind of movie, was going to direct it, which is exactly what I was looking for, because you want to do something totally different from the other Batman movies. I always thought there could be a really good movie made about Batman and when I heard that Chris was doing it I thought, ""Well, he\'s not a director that you would expect, therefore you\'re going to get the unexpected from him."" I think there\'s a great potential for going very dark with it, it\'s a fascinating character, very complex psychologically, which I\'ve never seen done. You know, you have the two extremes, which are both very good. You can either go the very camp Adam West TV series thing [Batman (1966)], which was great in its own way, or you can go more the way of the graphic Dark Knight novels which delve somewhat deeper.      I had spent weeks staring at the wall in my house out of depression because of things that had gone wrong and the choices I had made. When I read The Machinist (2004), I just went, ""Wow! This is perfect."" I was having dreams about the character and I couldn\'t stop thinking about it. I felt like this one was going to save my arse, and pull me out of the depressed state I had got into.      I did other things, but my heart was never in it. A lot of actors say that theater\'s the thing for them. And that\'s great, and I\'m not one to speak with any authority about it because of not having done it properly. For me, movies are what I love.      At first, I was somewhat hesitant to do the role [Batman Begins (2005)]. I mean, after all, Batman is an icon. But I remember, as clear as day, being at the grocery store the day the movie opened, and this little boy saw me. He couldn\'t have been more than five years old. He just walked right up to me and hugged me. He hugged me, and I was so moved by it that I hugged him back. Then he looked up at me and said, ""You\'re my hero."" And in that moment, I knew that not only as an actor that I had done my job, but that I had made the right decision to play Batman. And I\'ve never looked back on my the decision to play Batman since.      [on playing Batman] You couldn\'t pull it off unless you became a beast inside that suit.      I only sound intelligent when there\'s a good scriptwriter around.      I\'m English. Our dentistry is not world famous. But I made sure I got moldings of my old teeth beforehand because I miss them.      I don\'t think I\'m like any of the characters I\'ve played. They\'re all really far from who I am.      You can\'t help but find that violence is endlessly fascinating -- and I mean true violence, not action-movie violence, just because it is used as the answer to so many problems. We\'re all taught as kids not to be violent, but you can\'t help but also see that violence is what works very often. Bullies thrive.      I think there\'s a kind of pretentiousness to the idea that serious work is only found in low-budget independent movies -- I can\'t stand that snobbery.      I like being kept in the dark myself. You know, like mushrooms: Keep \'em in the dark and feed \'em shit. See, I think that\'s an enjoyable vegetable to be.      At the time that [Christopher Nolan] asked me to do it [Batman Begins (2005)], I actually couldn\'t do one push-up. They sent me to a trainer, who was having to hold my T-shirt at the back just to pull me up. I\'ve come a long way from that.      [on filming Batman films during the summer] I\'m not really looking forward to wearing a black rubber suit in the summertime in humid Chicago. If you see a pool of sweat through the city, follow it and you will find me.      [on director Christopher Nolan\'s method for filming Batman Begins (2005)] We tend to shoot at night like some kind of covert operation. So, we have minimal people actually seeing me in that way.      [on being asked if he knew how big a flop Newsies (1992) was] You say something bad about Newsies and you have an awful lot of people to answer to.      [on the character of Batman] He\'s a messed-up individual, as well. He\'s got all sorts of issues. He\'s just as twisted and messed-up as the villains he\'s fighting, and that\'s part of the beauty of the whole story.      [on his career] I\'ve been able to work on movies that I like very much in the past few years, which I think have turned out how I had hoped that they would. And, I\'m human, you know; that makes me feel good. I like it when people like what I do. I don\'t like it when people are laughing at me for what I do, you know? I mean, I\'d love to say I was completely impervious to anybody\'s opinion, but that just ain\'t the truth. Of course, it matters. At the same time, there\'s also a danger when you start playing it too safe. After all, what am I paid to do? I\'m paid to essentially make an ass out of myself, if needed. And occasionally, in doing that, you\'re going to fall flat on your face. But, I have learned, through doing that numerous times in my life, that there\'s also a ton of enjoyment to what other people see as humiliation. You can actually come to sort of thrive on that, because in a way, it kind of leads to a sort of fearlessness, if you genuinely don\'t mind. If the point is that you tried, I think that really is the most important thing. And, like you said, I feel like I\'ve been very fortunate in the last couple of years that I\'ve gotten to do what I loved, which is actually the making of movies, and on top of that, if I\'ve liked how the movies have turned out themselves, then that\'s fantastic. But, to start getting too comfortable within that would be eventually to start churning out boring, boring chaff. (2007)      I\'m accustomed to not having any map for my life. I\'d be reaching for an Uzi if I knew what was going to happen every day. If anybody tells me I shouldn\'t jump, of course all I want to do is jump and show it can be done.      Life is not stable. There is a great strength that comes from not being shocked or scared by upheavals.      I don\'t think I was particularly in need of superheroes. I never had any fascination with Superman or Spider-Man or a Batman kind of character. If it happened at all, it was imagined characters that I had invented. My dad was a role model for me. He was a fascinating man. There was intrigue and entertainment growing up with him. He gave me an edict that I still pursue: ""Life should never be boring"".      [on meeting Arnold Schwarzenegger in a car park] He\'s got bodyguards and they were all shouting at me and I was going, \'Hold on, hold on, I\'ve met him before!\' but they were getting very worried as I walked toward him. But we chatted a bit. He had questions about Terminator Salvation (2009), he didn\'t know the script at all but I hear apparently he\'s now seen the movie... I\'ll wait to hear what his reaction is...      Variety is essential for me. I love watching a Michael Mann movie. I love watching a Christopher Nolan movie. Just to talk about my stuff, I enjoy a The Machinist (2004) kind of movie, a Rescue Dawn (2006), a 3:10 to Yuma (2007), an American Psycho (2000), whatever. But I also love watching The Terminator (1984) movies, I love watching the Batman (1989) movies...Public Enemies (2009) is very timely. The Depression had people resenting the fat cats, the banks and so you\'ve got someone like Dillinger being a hero because he was making a difference - he was getting it back for himself and so many people looked at him and romanticised that.      You look back at the history of the Oscars - some of the best movies never got sh*t.      [on Heath Ledger\'s Oscar win for The Dark Knight (2008)] Heath winning Best Supporting Actor was fantastic. I had dinner with his family a couple of nights before the awards and liked very much they were the people who were picking it up for him. Of course I was really delighted that it did go that way.      I\'m actually someone that\'s very anti the whole B-Rolls, DVD extras and stuff like that. I understand people are interested, I get that they want to hear about it, but to me I look at it as old school movie magic and with magic you do not reveal your secrets.      [The Terminator (1984)] is the original nightmare of just being pursued that everyone has, by somebody who just will not stop, never stops, doesn\'t give up. And when you\'ve got someone who looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger coming after you it made a big difference.      [on avoiding media coverage of Heath Ledger\'s death] I paid no attention to it. I knew him, I knew the family and why the hell would I sit there listening to idiots who don\'t know anything at all? I literally didn\'t read anything, didn\'t watch anything (after he died). If I happened to be watching anything that came on, I switched over straight away. It\'s incredible the way the voyeuristic outlook is accepted as news.      [on The Dark Knight (2008)] Many times, I\'ll work with actors and I can tell they\'re thinking: ""What are you doing? Why are you going that far with it?"" or ""You\'re nuts!"". With [Heath Ledger], I could feel him going: ""I love it!"".      [on his infamous onset rant on Terminator Salvation (2009)] I don\'t feel like I have to explain, ""Well, I\'m not really like this. I\'m a wonderful guy and I have a lovely smile and how can you not like me?"".      [on his infamous onset rant on Terminator Salvation (2009)] It wouldn\'t have happened if we hadn\'t been playing that scene, for Christ\'s sake, between John Connor and his wife, which is probably the most intense one in the movie. I\'d definitely say that that guy who was yelling was at least half John Connor, and the rest was Christian Bale.      Look, I hate to throw people under the bus for making movies I don\'t think are very good. But for Terminator Salvation (2009) to be considered with any legitimacy, you have to throw number three [Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)] under the bus. It began to spoof the whole thing. To me, that was a sign that the franchise was dead, the mythology was finished.      [on Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)] I really liked the second one. It had as much to do with the electric atmosphere in the theater when I saw it at 17, when I was first getting out to the States, and I\'d never been in a movie theater that had that much noise and excitement throughout the entire movie.      [on starting a new trilogy with Terminator Salvation (2009)] I hope that it will be a really fun, great movie trilogy if this one takes off and that we get to do a second or third, with me or not, whatever the scenario is. I think there is actually - in the hands of the right people - a real revival for this and an extension to an already good mythology.      I was up in Toronto and went to see that movie La vita \xe8 bella (1997). By myself. And when I came out, I had a craving for blood unlike anything I had ever experienced since I decided to go vegetarian at the age of 7. It was a compulsion. It was undeniable. I went to several restaurants, one right after the other, and got the biggest, bloodiest steaks I could get my hands on. It was the first time I had tasted flesh in almost twenty years.      I\'ve never felt Welsh. I was just born there and I don\'t remember it. In terms of growing up, it was completely English.      I wouldn\'t want someone making a film of my life. I\'d be on set every day saying they\'re telling it wrong.      [on portraying Bruce Wayne as a jerk] That\'s always his cover. It\'s something that has to be there to make people never suspect that he\'s someone that would ever have the desire or belief, the passion or intelligence, the capability to be Batman. He has to be this kind of ridiculous clich\xe9 of a playboy.      I have very strong opinions about why kids should not be working at such a young age. I think introducing children to a professional industry where they may not recognize the pressure is wrong. Very quickly they\'re going to be under pressure. This is an adult industry. I would be very skeptical putting anybody I cared about, who was close to me, in this profession at a young age. I absolutely support it as a hobby and as an amateur pursuit, but to enter into it in a professional way is a whole different ball game.      To be honest, it was only a couple of years ago that I finally decided to stick at acting. Before that, I used to think, ""I don\'t want to do this any more - I want to quit. I hate it."" It\'s such a silly job. Some days I\'d think I should be doing something much more important than this. I\'d like to say acting is a meaningful and difficult job but it\'s actually damn easy and pretty pointless. Sometimes I love it but other days I think, ""This sucks."".      [on David O. Russell\'s recent work] I think the thing that resonates so much for me with what David has been telling stories about recently is just the fact that the things that feel like disasters in your life, don\'t turn out to be disasters. That life throws you many curve balls. The things that seem like gifts, can turn out to be disastrous. And never to be surprised at how surprised you can be at life. [2014]      [on his character\'s epic comb-over in American Hustle (2013)] For me it was so unexpected to see this con artist having such an unconvincing con on his head. And that he was so brilliant at what he did but so terrible at what he did on top of his head. There was a great juxtaposition in it. It became a very vital thing to add to it. And very charming as well. Generally, people think of con men being very slick and maybe vain and certainly very smooth operators. We didn\'t want to make Irv that.      [on how David O. Russell likes to hide places on set] One of the funniest things for me on set [of American Hustle (2013)] was watching where David was going to hide. He always likes to be very close to the actors. He likes to be able to feel the atmosphere of the scene. So literally he\'d be trying to hide under our chairs and the DP would be ""No David, I see you there."" And then he\'d be jumping over a table somewhere and finding a spot where he could be very close and get a sense of being right there with us.      I walk under ladders, I do all that stuff. I do it on purpose. I like provoking superstitions.      [on Terrence Malick] Terry has a thing where he loves it when you are not trying to please him, which is very different from most directors. Most directors want you to please them. And they\'ve got a definite goal, which is not really always egotistical. The nature of having a script is that you have points and scenes where you have to take the audience to a certain place by the end of it. So there\'s always a goal there. With The New World (2005), there was a script. But, he abandoned it most of the time. He would never have the scenes be in the same place or a repetition of them. There would never be a request of, \'Can you change that a little bit and then we\'ve got it.\' It would be, \'OK, let\'s discover something new about it. But what (working with Malick) means as an actor is that you are not trying so hard. You just sort of see what happens. If it comes naturally, you do it. If it doesn\'t, you don\'t. That\'s what he loves. With this one you\'ve got a character who is a man of words, who has lost all use for his own words, who is tired of talking. But there would be certain scenes where Terry might say to me, \'Alright, this is the topic. Talk a little bit about this.\' And it just felt wrong. And sometimes I would be totally silent and it would go great. It\'s all I needed. As long as you are not attempting something, you are just discovering it as you go along. That\'s what delights him. He\'s very excited by what he does and by making films.      [on being called a \'star\'] I\'m embarrassed when people say things such as \'star\'. It\'s so vacuous. What if it was the apocalypse right now? What use would I be to anybody? Most people have definite skills but I\'d be going \'Yeah, you know what? I\'m going to pretend to be somebody else\'. That\'s a great leveller. Ultimately, I\'m useless.      [on The Promise (2016) and the Armenian Genocide] To my shame, I knew nothing about the Armenian Genocide. When I first read the script, it was an uncanny moment. (...) I really only hope that the film can help and not actually exacerbate any problems. But to me, it doesn\'t take a genius to see that there\'s an embarrassment to having to acknowledge the atrocities that occurred in the birthing of a nation [Republic of Turkey]. It happens to many nations. [2017]      [on The Promise (2016)] There\'s something important about a film that many people have tried to stop being made for decades. One and a half million people were killed in the most brutal fashion, and I knew nothing about it, and that\'s not uncommon. That\'s improbably bizarre. This is modern history...The fact that this Armenian Genocide happened and no one was ever held accountable may have provoked other genocides since.

He spent several years trying desperately to sway this image, but this was a double-edged sword. His work comprised nineteen films, including 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), The Patriot (2000), A Knight\'s Tale (2001), Monster\'s Ball (2001), Ned Kelly (2003), The Brothers Grimm (2005), Lords of Dogtown (2005), Brokeback Mountain (2005), Casanova (2005), Candy (2006), I\'m Not There. (2007), The Dark Knight (2008) and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009). He also produced and directed music videos and aspired to be a film director.Heath Ledger was born on the fourth of April 1979, in Perth, Western Australia, to Sally (Ramshaw), a teacher of French, and Kim Ledger, a mining engineer who also raced cars. His ancestry was Scottish, English, Irish, and Sephardi Jewish. As the story goes, in junior high school it was compulsory to take one of two electives, either cooking or drama. As Heath could not see himself in a cooking class he tried his hand at drama. Heath was talented, however the rest of the class did not acknowledge his talent. When he was seventeen he and a friend decided to pack up, leave school, take a car and rough it to Sydney. Heath believed Sydney to be the place where dreams were made or, at least, where actors could possibly get their big break. Upon arriving in Sydney with a purported sixty-nine cents to his name, Heath tried everything to get a break.His first real acting job came in a low-budget movie called Blackrock (1997), a largely unimpressive clich\xe9; an adolescent angst film about one boy\'s struggle when he learns his best mate raped a girl. He only had a very small role in the film. After that small role Heath auditioned for a role in a T.V. show called Sweat (1996) about a group of young Olympic hopefuls. He was offered one of two roles, one as a swimmer, another as a gay cyclist. Heath accepted the latter because he felt to really stand out as an actor one had to accept unique roles that stood out from the bunch. It got him small notice, but unfortunately the show was quickly axed, forcing him to look for other roles. He was in Home and Away (1988) for a very short period, in which he played a surfer who falls in love with one of the girls of Summer Bay. Then came his very brief role in Paws (1997), a film which existed solely to cash in on guitar prodigy Nathan Cavaleri\'s brief moment of fame, where he was the hottest thing in Australia. Heath played a student in the film, involved in a stage production of a Shakespeare play, in which he played ""Oberon"". A very brief role, this offered him a small paycheck but did nothing to advance his career. Then came Two Hands (1999). He went to the U.S. trying to audition for film roles, showcasing his brief role in Roar (1997) opposite then unknown Vera Farmiga.Then Australian director Gregor Jordan auditioned him for the lead in Two Hands (1999), which he got. An in your face Aussie crime thriller, Two Hands (1999) was outstanding and helped him secure a role in 10 Things I Hate About You (1999). After that, it seemed Heath was being typecast as a young hunk, which he did not like, so he accepted a role in a very serious war drama The Patriot (2000).What followed was a stark inconsistency of roles, Ledger accepting virtually every single character role, anything to avoid being typecast. Some met with praise, like his short role in Monster\'s Ball (2001), but his version of Ned Kelly (2003) was an absolute flop, which led distributors hesitant to even release it outside Australia. Heath finally had deserved success with his role in Brokeback Mountain (2005). For his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in in the film, Ledger won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and Best International Actor from the Australian Film Institute, and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and for the Academy Award for Best Actor.Ledger was found dead on January 22, 2008 in his apartment in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo, with a bottle of prescription sleeping pills near-by. It was concluded weeks later that he died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs that included pain-killers, sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. His death occurred during editing of The Dark Knight (2008) and in the midst of filming his last role as Tony in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009).Posthumously, he shared the 2007 Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award with the rest of the ensemble cast, the director, and the casting director for the film I\'m Not There. (2007), which was inspired by the life and songs of American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. In the film, Ledger portrayed a fictional actor named Robbie Clark, one of six characters embodying aspects of Dylan\'s life and persona.A few months before his death, Ledger had finished filming his performance as the Joker in \'The Dark Knight (2008). His untimely death cast a somber shadow over the subsequent promotion of the $185 million Batman production. Ledger received more than thirty posthumous accolades for his critically acclaimed performance as the Joker, the psychopathic clown prince of crime, in the film, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a Best Actor International Award at the 2008 Australian Film Institute Awards (for which he became the first actor to win an award posthumously), the 2008 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor, the 2009 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture, and the 2009 BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       James Briggs and Pedro Borges          Trade Mark (3)        Deep husky voice        Known for completely immersing himself in his roles        His warm smileTrivia (93)      He and his older sister, Kate Ledger, are named after the two main romantic characters of the Emily Bront\xeb novel, ""Wuthering Heights"".

The day I stop having fun, I\'ll just walk away. I wasn\'t going to have fun doing a teen movie again.... I don\'t want to do this for the rest of my life....I don\'t want to spend the rest of my youth doing this in this industry. There\'s so much I want to discover. (Vanity Fair, August 2000)      I prefer to date older women because they don\'t try to act older like younger girls but because they try to act younger.      It\'s a little uncomfortable doing love scenes in armor, but, you know, when the heat\'s on, the heat\'s on. (Access Hollywood (1996), August 2000)      [about the paparazzi] Most of the time you don\'t even know they\'re there. Now, that\'s the scary thing. It\'s really strange and invading, but I\'m still working it all out. I try to not let it bother me. I really try and find the humour in all of it. And if I want to swim naked in my pool, I\'m still going to do it. I certainly don\'t want to feel that I have to change everything in my life that I do to cater to them. I just won\'t let it happen. (National Post, May 2001)      I don\'t have a technique. I\'ve never been a believer in having one set technique on how to act. There are no rules and there is no rulebook. At the end of the day, it all comes down to my instincts. That\'s the one thing that guides me through every decision professionally. Socially, also. That\'s my technique. Yeah, you read through the script 100 times. I guess I have little characteristics about myself. Sometimes, most often than not, once we start shooting I won\'t look at the script at all until we finished shooting. It\'s kind of like it\'s been imprinted in my head during rehearsals. You just let it go. (Reel.com, May 2001)      I\'m the worst auditioner, really, really bad. I mean, you\'re being judged and I\'m just so aware of it that it consumes me. I can\'t relax, I\'m tied in knots, so the voice is very taut and tense. You\'re so aware that you\'re acting \'cause you\'re sitting across from this lady with a piece of paper who\'s going, \'\'I\'m. Going. To. Shoot. You. If. You. Don\'t. Blah, blah, blah,\'\' in this emotionless voice. It\'s foul. I hate it. (EW.com, May 2001)      People just love to bash LA. People say it\'s so pretentious, so arrogant, so this and that. But it\'s truly a wonderful place. You don\'t have to go to the places where that stuff goes on. You don\'t have to go to Beverly Hills, you don\'t have to go to the parties. You can live up in the Lower Canyon and live such a perfectly healthy, beautiful, fun life with all your friends. You can drive two hours one way and be at the Joshua Tree desert, two hours one way you\'re skiing at Big Bear. Sure, it can get full-on and that\'s why it\'s good to get out. But it\'s too easy just to say, ""Nup, I hate it. I\'m not living there anymore."" (NW Magazine, March 2000)      [about growing up with his mom and his sisters] I learned respect for women, and patience. You grow up with all those women around you...you learn to wait your turn. (Cosmopolitan, June 1998)      I never studied acting in Australia. I never had an empty stage and black pajamas to run around and express myself.      [on his character ""Ennis"" in Brokeback Mountain (2005)] The challenge was to capture the stillness of him. I have kind of semi-frantic, nervous energy. Harnessing that was something I thought I\'d have to work out. Shooting in the wilderness, the stillness became like this innate quality.      Brooklyn seems to me the closest thing in America to Europe. The neighbors and locals are beautiful people. It\'s like a village.      [on daughter Matilda and being a father] Matilda is adorable, and beautifully observant and wise. Michelle and I love her so much. Becoming a father exceeds all my expectations. It\'s the most remarkable experience I\'ve ever had - it\'s marvelous.      I\'m not good at future planning. I don\'t plan at all. I don\'t know what I\'m doing tomorrow. I don\'t have a day planner and I don\'t have a diary. I completely live in the now, not in the past, not in the future.      [on playing ""The Joker"" in The Dark Knight (2008)] The Joker, so far, is definitely the most fun I\'ve had with any character. He\'s just out of control -- no empathy, he\'s a sociopath, uh, a psychotic, mass-murdering clown. And, uh, I\'m just thoroughly, thoroughly enjoying it. It\'s just exceeded any expectations I had of what the experience would be like.      [on his choice of film projects] I feel like I\'m wasting time if I repeat myself. I can\'t say I\'m proud of my work. It\'s the same with everything I do: the day I say \'It\'s good\' is the day I should start doing something else.      [on walking down the red carpet] Like diving into an Olympic pool, swimming the length underwater, then emerging gasping for breath. It\'s so noisy that it\'s quiet, you can\'t hear; the flashlights are so blinding that it\'s dark, you can\'t see.      I start to get bored, not with the choices I was making, because I didn\'t really have a choice. The choices were being made for me -- I was being thrown into projects. So I kind of put the brakes on that. In a sense, I destroyed my career to rebuild it again.      I like to do something I fear. I like to set up obstacles and defeat them. I like to be afraid of the project. I always am. When I get cast in something, I always believe I shouldn\'t have been cast. I fooled them again. I can\'t do it. I don\'t know how to do it. There\'s a huge amount of anxiety that drowns out any excitement I have toward the project.      No amount of money changes what I do between \'action\' and \'cut\'. Before I got into the industry, I never imagined I\'d have anywhere near the money I have now. I don\'t need any more. It\'s not that I don\'t want the money, it\'s just that I would have been really happy sitting on a beach or surfing every morning. I never had money, and I was very happy without it. When I die, my money\'s not gonna come with me. My movies will live on - for people to judge what I was as a person. I just want to stay curious.      [on dropping the character once the shoot ends] I kind of save the living for the time between action and cut. I\'m pretty good at dropping a character once it\'s over for the day. Certainly once the film is over, I throw it all away. Your life is what matters. (Chicago Sun Times, November 2007)      [on the directors he would have liked to work with] Look, most of them are dead. Fellini. Cassavettes. Bob Fosse. Stanley Kubrick. I would have loved to work with them. I would love to work with many people who are around, but they\'re not lining up just yet. Terrence Malick is one person who comes to mind. I would love to be in one of his visual poems. (Chicago Sun Times, November 2007)      [on his sleeping problems] Last week I probably slept an average of two hours a night. I couldn\'t stop thinking. My body was exhausted, and my mind was still going. (The New York Times, November 2007)      Some people find their shtick. I\'ve never figured out who Heath Ledger is on film: \'This is what you expect when you hire me, and it will be recognizable.\' People always feel compelled to sum you up, to presume that they have you and can describe you. That\'s fine. But there are many stories inside of me and a lot I want to achieve outside of one flat note. (The New York Times, November 2007)      I think [getting the role] was tougher for other people to comprehend than it was for me. I\'m looking forward to it. A part of me feels like I\'ve been warming up to [playing the Joker] for years. In The Brothers Grimm (2005), [director] Terry Gilliam helped me put on a sort of clown act and adjust to that sort of pace. And I feel it\'s something within me I know how to do. I like putting on a mask. It\'ll be dark and sinister and exciting. Not being a huge comic book fan, and not one to really follow comic book movies, I\'m relaxed about it. (NY Daily News, November 2006)      I\'m shy. People get confused. They think as an actor you can get up and be confident on the screen. ""Why aren\'t you like this in normal life? Why can\'t you act in your social life?"" Because I can\'t! (NY Post, 2001)      A lot of people think ambition or success and they think dollars. My ambition is all in my head. I\'m on a f---ing journey. I\'m on a walkabout. It\'s about collecting wisdom of emotions and heart and self and understanding. Being absolutely comfortable with your body and life and the earth, sun, and moon being the only truths. That\'s what my success is, getting underneath that. (Entertainment Weekly, 2001)      [on choosing his roles] I don\'t have that much forward planning about what I want to do in the future. But I guess once I find something, like if I\'m doing Lords of Dogtown (2005), I really like to flip the scale on the next job I\'m doing. It\'s almost like you are a switchboard in a sound booth and on one job you use one side and by the end of the job you are kind of exhausted by it, but you didn\'t use any of the other side over here so you have to find something that will mean you using this half of your brain, energy wise, and that\'s how Brokeback Mountain (2005) and Casanova complemented each other. Brokeback was excruciating and Casanova (2005) was drinking wine and eating pasta, it was like a holiday. But I\'ve got no future plans, I don\'t know what I\'m going to do next as along as it scares me, as long as it\'s something new, as long as I get to scare other people. As long as it\'s an opportunity to evolve and grow as an actor and a person and challenge myself.      Honesty always gets my attention. Not particularly someone who is honest to me, but someone who is honest with themselves. That is a quality I really enjoy, admire and love.      I love acting. Oh, God, I love it. But all this fame and all this bullshit attention. I\'m not supernatural. I\'ve done nothing extremely special to deserve the position. It happens every couple of years, and it\'s happened to hundreds of people before me. (Newsweek, July 2000)      I have never had great expectations of my performance or of a film. I try not to think about the outcome. If you look that far ahead, it sort of taints your choices as an actor. I try as hard as I can to believe that no one is ever going to see it and that it\'s not even a movie. Then you can allow yourself to bare more. Then, once a project is done, I tend to forget about it until it comes out. (Daily Telegraph, November 2007)      I don\'t have a method to my madness... For me, acting is more about self-exploration. I\'ve learned a lot about myself in order to learn about the craft. I\'ve always been very big on self-exploration and answering my own questions.

Yeah, I\'ve done a lot of smaller stuff before, so it\'s nice to be in something that people actually see - on the outstanding success of The Dark Knight (2008).      [on working with Nicole Kidman on Rabbit Hole (2010)]: ""She was irritated with me and I was irritated with her. But that\'s the way movie-making is. For one day, are we not allowed? For half a day even? It\'s so surprising to me when people are surprised that movie making is sometimes tense and uncomfortable because inherently it\'s going to be.You\'re around tens of people or hundreds of people working on things that are imaginary and that come from the soul. You could be dealing with subject matter like prostitution, death, drugs, blah, blah, blah. How could you expect that not to be uncomfortable?""      (2011, on mentally visualizing your goals) I believe if you contextualize something then it will manifest in your life. I have done that with houses, cars, jobs. It absolutely works and it\'s not hocus-pocus. I believe everything in life has a spiritual component and everything\'s fair game.      (On his nomadic upbringing) I came back from summer camp and my dad said: \'Boys we\'re moving to England\' and I said \'No we\'re not\' But dad said \'I don\'t care about the expense or whatever, you guys can travel as much as you want when we get there.\' So I\'d ski in Europe, I\'d go to Greece, Spain, Moscow, I played soccer in Paris and rugby in Munich. We did everything.      [on his job working at a movie theater in Sydney, Australia) I thought Crocodile Dundee (1986) was an inspirational film, I loved that movie. I\'m serious. I saw it hundreds of times.      I\'m not prone to doing science fiction, it\'s not my bag.      [on working with Heath Ledger] My experience was wonderful. It was the experience of...loving to act myself, to watch somebody who loved his character and had the discipline to make a bold creation. I found myself trying to keep up with him and I was also admiring him at the same time. I watched him off-camera and on-camera, as an actor, to see his process. After the day was over, I shook his hand and said, \'That\'s why I\'m an actor - \'cos of guys like you\'. So I treasure that time with him...He was brilliant, he was brilliant to watch, he was brilliant to see on a daily basis, on set in the makeup trailer, when we were putting on our makeup together. I was doing Harvey\'s and he was doing the Joker\'s and trying to figure it out. If you would have said to Heath, \'Hey dude, this is a superhero movie, why don\'t you chill?\' You just wouldn\'t say that to him. And I don\'t think that the movie would be as special if he did, so I think we all have to strive to those standards.      (2011 quote, on quitting drinking) I couldn\'t be happier with that decision. I recommend it to anybody. I did not go to AA...I haven\'t had a drink for seven or eight years. I\'ve changed my lifestyle. I don\'t go out. That\'s not just because of drinking, it\'s because of getting older. I\'ve outgrown it, plus all my friends are married and have kids. I\'m very interested in my health and I want to live the rest of my life very healthily. I feel 100 per cent in command of myself, so, when I get up, I never have to ask, \'where have I been? What have I said?\'      [re his affection for Cary Grant] I always feel like he\'s so good that he was not regarded as an actor. Maybe he didn\'t have the range that people expect a modern actor to have, but there\'s never been anybody like him.      [on cigars] They\'re excellent to study to. You can put \'em down, pick \'em up - they keep you company while you\'re thinking. They\'re a good thinking man\'s tool. With cigars it\'s inherent in the mechanics that you\'re going to sit down for a long time. You plan your day around it.      [on cigars] Say I\'m dating a girl and at first she\'ll have whatever concept of a cigar, and then let\'s say we are intimate and so we kiss and stuff like that. By a week or two she will be begging to smoke a cigar before we kiss. It\'s incredible! It\'s an habitude. It becomes part of the intimacy, which is extremely weird because you\'d think it would be revolting. I mean, if you polled the public whether it was worse to beat your grandmother or smoke a cigar I don\'t know who would win. People freaking hate cigars. And there\'s a stigma with it, that you\'re a certain kind of a person.      [on cigars] Non-smokers think it\'s the most unhealthy, unattractive thing they\'ve ever seen. I was in Australia one time, by a bridge, smoking a cigar and taking some pictures. These runners went by and this woman just had a visceral reaction, made a noise like \'Eeeerugaah\'.

He left school at age 15 and took a series of working-class jobs before joining the British army and serving in Korea during the Korean War, where he saw combat. Upon his return to England, he gravitated toward the theater and got a job as an assistant stage manager. He adopted the name of Caine on the advice of his agent, taking it from a marquee that advertised The Caine Mutiny (1954). In the years that followed, he worked in more than 100 television dramas, with repertory companies throughout England and eventually in the stage hit ""The Long and the Short and the Tall"".Zulu (1964), the epic retelling of a historic 19th-century battle in South Africa between British soldiers and Zulu warriors, brought Caine to international attention. Instead of being typecast as a low-ranking Cockney soldier, he played a snobbish, aristocratic officer. Although ""Zulu"" was a major success, it was the role of Harry Palmer in The Ipcress File (1965) and the title role in Alfie (1966) that made Caine a star of the first magnitude. He epitomized the new breed of actor in mid-1960s England, the working-class bloke with glasses and a down-home accent. However, after initially starring in some excellent films, particularly in the 1960s, including Gambit (1966), Funeral in Berlin (1966), Play Dirty (1969), Battle of Britain (1969), Too Late the Hero (1970), The Last Valley (1971) and especially Get Carter (1971), he seemed to take on roles in below-average films, simply for the money he could by then command.However, there were some gems amongst the dross. He gave a magnificent performance opposite Sean Connery in The Man Who Would Be King (1975) and turned in a solid one as a German colonel in The Eagle Has Landed (1976). Educating Rita (1983) and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) (for which he won his first Oscar) were highlights of the 1980s, while more recently Little Voice (1998), The Cider House Rules (1999) (his second Oscar) and Last Orders (2001) have been widely acclaimed. Caine played Nigel Powers in the parody sequel Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002), and Alfred Pennyworth in Christopher Nolan\'s Dark Knight trilogy. He appeared in several other of Nolan\'s films including The Prestige (2006), Inception (2010) and Interstellar (2014). He also appeared as a supporting character in Alfonso Cuaron\'s Children of Men (2006) and Pixar\'s sequel Cars 2 (2011).As of 2015, films in which Caine has starred have grossed over $7.4 billion worldwide. He is ranked the ninth highest grossing box office star. Caine is one of several actors nominated for an Academy Award for acting every decade from five consecutive decades (the other being Laurence Olivier and Meryl Streep). He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1992 Birthday Honours, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2000 Birthday Honours in recognition for his contributions to the cinema.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Pedro Borges          Spouse (2) Shakira Caine (8 January\xa01973            - present)\xa0(1 child)           Patricia Haines (3 April\xa01954            - 1958)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)          Trade Mark (5)        His spectacles (rare for 1960s leading actors)        His cockney accent        Often plays mentors and father figures to younger characters in films        Tall, lean frame        Frequently works with director Christopher NolanTrivia (99)      His first American accent was in the film Hurry Sundown (1967).

Younger brother Stanley Caine appeared in at least three of Caine\'s films: Billion Dollar Brain (1967), Play Dirty (1969) and The Italian Job (1969). He did not know about his elder half-brother David until their mother died. David suffered from epilepsy and had lived in a hospital his entire life.      The title role in Alfie (1966) was turned down by Anthony Newley and Terence Stamp before it was offered to him.      Lodged with composer John Barry in the early 1960s for several months, after being forced to leave his own flat, penniless. He returned the favor in 1998 when agreeing to introduce the composer\'s Royal Albert Hall concert - his first in the United Kingdom for 25 years.      ""Michael Caine"", a top 10 song in Britain in the mid-1980s by the new wave group Madness, had his ""My Name is Michael Caine"" quote sampled into the song.      2001: Was voted fifth in the Orange Film Survey of greatest British actors.      Lobbied for the lead role in The Day of the Jackal (1973) but was rejected by director Fred Zinnemann, who felt that the character of The Jackal, who essentially is a cipher, should not be played by a movie star.      Three of his memorable films (Alfie (1966), The Italian Job (1969) and Get Carter (1971)) have all been remade.      1987: Was not present at the Academy Awards ceremony when he won best supporting actor for Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) because he was filming Jaws: The Revenge (1987), for which he was nominated for worst supporting actor at the Razzie awards the following year.      Has stated that the character of Vichy war criminal Pierre Brossard in The Statement (2003) was his least favorite. He said that all the other characters he played in his career, whether good or evil, had a sense of humor on some level that he would try to convey in his performance. He felt that Brossard had no sense of humor whatsoever, in part because the character was such an intense man.      The soundstage at Shepperton Studios, in which he filmed Batman Begins (2005), is also the one where he filmed his very first film, A Hill in Korea (1956).      Close friends with Sir Sean Connery, Sir Roger Moore, Sir Elton John and Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber.      Throughout the 1960s, he was by his own estimation drinking two bottles of vodka and smoking at least eighty cigarettes a day. He quit smoking cigarettes following a stern lecture from Tony Curtis at a party in 1971, and finally quit smoking cigars shortly before his 70th birthday in 2003.      Was the first person to be nominated for an acting Razzie award for more than one title. He was nominated for Worst Actor of 1980 at the very first Razzie awards for his roles in the films Dressed to Kill (1980) and The Island (1980).      In 1957, at Brighton University, Caine appeared in a one-act play written by a fellow actor who went by the name of David Baron. It was Baron\'s very first play. He later changed his name back to Harold Pinter, the name under which he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005.      Superstar Swedish rock band Kent refer to him in their song ""Palace and Main"".      Near the end of The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992), he passes by a store called ""Micklewhite\'s"". His real name is Maurice Micklewhite.      Allegedly did not get along with Steven Seagal while filming On Deadly Ground (1994).Mike Myers said that he based the character of Austin Powers partially on Caine\'s character in Alfie (1966). Caine would play Austin Powers father in Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002).      Visited John Wayne several times when the veteran star was dying of cancer in hospital.      Caine has been very open about his political views. He left the United Kingdom in 1979 for tax reasons and did not return until 1987 when Margaret Thatcher had cut the top rate of income tax. An ardent Thatcherite during the 1980s, Caine switched his support to Tony Blair\'s New Labour Party shortly before the 1997 General Election. In an interview with ""The Sunday Telegraph"" on 26 April 2009, Caine admitted that he was considering becoming a tax exile again if Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown increased taxes on high earners. He confirmed in an interview with ""The Mail on Sunday"" newspaper on 1 November 2009 that he had dropped his support for Labour and would vote Conservative at the next General Election. He publicly supported Conservative Party leader David Cameron for Prime Minister in the 2010 General Election. In January 2016, he also publicly called for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.      Has been nominated for an Oscar at least once in five consecutive decades (1960s-2000s).      Turned down Alfred Hitchcock\'s crime thriller Frenzy (1972).      12/18/05: Attended the party at his close friend Sir Elton John\'s Old Windsor mansion after the singer married David Furnish in a civil partnership ceremony.      While he uses ""Michael Caine"" professionally, he used his given name in his personal life until he decided to officially change his name to Michael Caine in 2016. He said in an interview that the reason was that he was losing too much time at the reinforced safety checks in airports because the name on his passport did not match his stage name.      Originally had the lead role of Switching Channels (1988) but was held up by production delays on Jaws: The Revenge (1987).      Has appeared in the remakes of two of his films: Get Carter (2000) and Sleuth (2007).Alfie (1966) and Sleuth (1972) were both remade with Jude Law taking over his role.      He is famous for the catch-phrase ""Not a lot of people know that"", though he never actually said it. The phrase was probably first said by Peter Sellers when he appeared Parkinson (1971) on 28 October 1972 and said: ""Not many people know that. This is my Michael Caine impression. You see, Mike\'s always quoting from the Guinness Book of Records. At the drop of a hat he\'ll trot one out. \'Did you know that it takes a man in a tweed suit five and a half seconds to fall from the top of Big Ben to the ground?\' Now there\'s not many people who know that!"".      His all-time favorite actor, his inspiration to become an actor and his hero is Humphrey Bogart.      Once said that he knew he\'d made it as an actor when he started getting scripts to read that no longer had coffee stains already on them (meaning that he was the first choice for that role).      He was made a Fellow of the British Film Institute in recognition of his outstanding contribution to film culture.

When she died in 1989, Caine learned that the cousin was really his elder brother, David.      Is a supporter of Chelsea FC (English soccer team).Educating Rita (1983) is his favourite film of his own, and the performance he\'s the most proud of.      Stated that for years he hated the smell of garlic as he associated it with his service in the Korean War where North Korean and Chinese troops would munch it as a snack. He eventually overcame his dislike upon becoming a restauranteur.      Claims that his trick to being able to cry on cue is thinking about a painful childhood memory.      His favorite film is The Third Man (1949).      As of 2013, he has three grandchildren, a granddaughter and two grandsons.      Visiting the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London, England.

For \'The Dark Knight trilogy\', Caine plays a butler to the Wayne family, where he supports, nurtures and loves the main character Bruce Wayne (Batman).

In 2009, he praised Christoph Waltz\'s performance as Colonel Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds (2009), saying that it was the ""best performance of a villain"" he has seen in years.      Though he had been considered for, but never appeared in a Bond movie, Caine was the very first person to hear the completed film score for Goldfinger (1964). After he and roommate Terence Stamp were both ejected from their apartment, Caine asked composer friend John Barry if he could use the spare bedroom at Barry\'s London residence. As they were good friends, Barry agreed and so for several months Caine crashed with Barry and was there the sleepless night he completed his iconic score. At breakfast the following morning, Barry played his composition for Caine, the first time he had performed it for anybody.      When he was still a struggling actor, Caine shared a London flat with future hairstylist-guru Vidal Sassoon.      Although often listed as 6\' 2"", Caine himself gave his height as 6\' 1"" in his autobiography ""What\'s It All About?"" (1992).      Acting mentor and friends with Julie Walters.      Ranked 10th highest grossing actor of all time with his previous films grossing $3.2 billion [2016].      In 2016, at age 83, he finally changed his legal name from Maurice Micklewhite to Michael Caine. He said this was because he was fed up being delayed in airport security by staff who did not understand why the name on his passport did not match the person they recognised.Personal Quotes (94)      [in 1967] I\'ve never been out with a married woman, never. I respect others\' properties.      My name is Michael Caine.      [on Jaws: The Revenge (1987)] I have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific.      I am in so many movies that are on TV at 2:00 a.m. that people think I am dead.      I used to get the girl; now I get the part. In The Quiet American (2002) you may have noticed I got the part and the girl. It\'s a milestone for me, because it\'s the last time I\'m going to get the girl. I\'m sure of it, now I\'m nearly seventy.      Movie acting is about covering the machinery. Stage acting is about exposing the machinery. In cinema, you should think the actor is playing himself, if he\'s that good. It looks very easy. It should. But it\'s not, I assure you. To disappear your complete self into a character is quite difficult. I\'ve tried it 85 times, and I\'ve succeeded two or three times.      The best research [for playing a drunk] is being a British actor for 20 years.      First of all, I choose the great roles, and if none of these come, I choose the mediocre ones, and if they don\'t come, I choose the ones that pay the rent.      The difference between a movie star and a movie actor is this--a movie star will say, ""How can I change the script to suit me?"" and a movie actor will say. ""How can I change me to suit the script?""      Be like a duck, my mother used to tell me. Remain calm on the surface and paddle like hell underneath.      [on doing the Texan accent for Secondhand Lions (2003)] I had a great dialect coach and he told me there\'s always one moment when you get something. He said, ""Do your Texan accent for me,"" when I had learned it from a tape. He said, ""It\'s too English!"". I said, ""Why?"". He said, ""Each word stands up like soldiers standing to attention next to each other. The way they talk in Texas, they\'re so lazy they sort of lean on each word"". And I could just picture all these words leaning over each other, and that\'s when I got it.      [In reference to the Oscar Family Album Tribute sequence at The 70th Annual Academy Awards (1998) and speaking live on British television following the Oscar ceremony in 1998] I was sat up there with the likes of Claire Trevor and Luise Rainer. It means a lot to me, it was amazing, they are living legends!      My view is that you should always do remakes of failures. Then you\'ve got nowhere to go but up, you know? They can\'t say, ""Well, it\'s not as good as the original, you made a piece of crap"". They\'d just say, ""What a piece of crap that was,"" anyway.      It\'s terrible. Every six weeks it\'s Christmas. In Catch-22 (1970), the hero says, ""Time is going by so fast, I have to make my life more boring."" That\'s what I\'ve got to do, because my life is so interesting and I enjoy myself so much, I\'ve got to make it more tedious, because I\'ll be 100 in a minute. My mother died when she was 90, so I\'ve got just under 20 years left. The terrible thing is that in obituaries, you read, ""He died at 74, he had a good life."" You think, ""Bloody hell, I\'ve only got 18 months to go"". And another strange thing about aging - as you get older, it gets faster, and you see people you haven\'t seen in what you think is five years, but it turns out to be 25 years. You say, ""I made that film ten years ago,"" and they correct me: ""Thirty, Michael. Thirty"".      My most useful acting tip came from my pal John Wayne. Talk low, talk slow, and don\'t say too much.      I did Harold Pinter\'s first play, ""The Room"". Harold was an actor named David Baron. He said, ""I\'m going to write"". I said, ""Oh yeah, it\'ll be nice"". He said, ""But I don\'t want to get mixed up with being an actor. I\'m going to write with my real name"". I said, ""What\'s your real name, David?"" He said, ""Harold Pinter"".      Whenever anyone asks me to do something about my life\'s work, I keep saying, ""Please, I haven\'t finished yet. Can you give me another year?"" . . . In a lifetime achievement award, you just have to watch yourself grow old in 45 minutes.      [on Alfie (1966)] To be a movie star, you have to carry a movie. And to carry a movie where you play the title role is the supreme example. The third thing, for a British actor, is to do it in America. The fourth is to get nominated for an award. That picture did all four things for me.      [on Richard Gere] He\'s got a pin-up image, which he hates. The only trouble is this: whenever they ask him to take his trousers off, he does.      Such is an actor\'s life. We must ride the waves of every film, barfing occasionally, yet maintain our dignity, even as the bulk of our Herculean efforts are keel-hauled before our very eyes.      You get paid the same for a bad film as you do for a good one.      I\'ll always be around because I\'m a skilled professional actor. Whether or not I\'ve any talent is beside the point.      In England I was a Cockney actor. In America, I was an actor.      I\'m the original bourgeois nightmare - a Cockney with intelligence and a million dollars.      Don\'t remake a successful picture, because you\'re liable to be the flop. Steve Martin and I made a much better picture of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988) than Marlon Brando and David Niven did. What I wouldn\'t do anymore is play any guest shots. I\'ve given that up. I did it as some fun and it backfired in Get Carter (2000) so I\'m not doing it again. Now I hear that they\'re going to remake The Italian Job (1969) with me in the No\xebl Coward part. I\'d consider it, yes.      I\'m a sort of boy next door. If that boy has a good scriptwriter.      [about remakes of his classic films such as Get Carter (1971) and The Italian Job (1969)] I wish they would remake the BAD ones!      I\'ve made an awful lot of films. In fact, I\'ve made a lot of awful films.      [on Heath Ledger\'s performance as The Joker] The worry going in was The Joker. Jack Nicholson was the greatest Joker so, you know, how do you top that? Well, Heath Ledger\'s done it and he\'s extraordinary. He\'s gone in a completely different direction to Jack. Jack was like a clown figure, benign but wicked, maybe a killer old uncle. He could be funny and make you laugh. Heath is like a really scary psychopath. I did one scene with him and he was ready to go and had to come up in a lift and raid our place. I didn\'t see him for rehearsal and when he came out of the lift he was so incredible I forgot my lines. He frightened the life out of me. I\'d never met him before. He\'s a lovely guy and his Joker is going to be a hell of a revelation in this picture.Educating Rita (1983) was wonderful, I did it with Julie Walters, the original girl. She is sensational, really fantastic, and she is a very nice person as well, which is always a bonus.      [on Otto Preminger] O.P. is only happy if everybody else is miserable. Still, if you can keep his paranoia from beating you down, you can learn a lot from the guy.      [on Ray Milland] A nice old bloke.      I love HD. Of course, it\'s very unforgiving, especially on young beautiful ladies, but thank God I\'m old, I don\'t care.      Do I believe in God? Yes I do. When you\'ve had a life like mine, you have to.      While shooting Harry Brown (2009): The young guys I met there were fascinated by my success. They asked how I got out of there. I told them the truth - I had a happy family. My mum and dad were together all the time. I won a scholarship to grammar school. And there was drink, but not drugs.      [on some of his mid-career flops] I did a couple of pictures which were absolutely dreadful - one was Blue Ice (1992), and another with Olivier, where I played a spy based on Philby [The Jigsaw Man (1983).] I thought there was no need to put myself through it. I had enough money. I opened eight restaurants, goofed around in Miami, until Jack Nicholson persuaded me to do Blood and Wine (1996) with him and restored my faith in the business.      After eight years in Hollywood: Weather always the same. Nothing to talk about. No seasons. My gardener told me that if I wanted to grow daffodils, I\'d have to keep them in the fridge for five weeks so they\'d think they were in England. But I couldn\'t put them in the fridge because I thought the maid would make onion soup out of them and poison the bloody lot of us.      When he was nominated for an Oscar for Educating Rita (1983): Irene Dunne and Loretta Young stopped me and said, \'We both voted for you.\' I couldn\'t believe it!      On his first days in Hollywood: It was amazing to see Fred Astaire doing his food shopping.      On learning acting in postwar Britain: There was a whole generation of English theatre actors who\'d do a film in order to buy a car or a refrigerator, but really thought it was beneath them.      [When he told his parents he wanted to act, they assumed he was gay.] That\'s what we thought actors were, all poofs. And sometimes we were right.      Old? I stopped ageing at 38. I still am 38 . . . except when they say, \'Run up those stairs.\'      [on playing Clarence in Is Anybody There? (2008)] I\'m my own worst critic. I spend my entire life trying to get it absolutely right. There are other actors who could do it better, but I\'m proud of it. There\'s no Michael Caine there, there\'s no ego there. You just see poor old Clarence.      I\'ve had such a great time, I\'d like to come back as me - and do it all over again.      Brown\'s (Gordon Brown) never been elected by anybody. I\'m supposed to be in a country where I get the chance to elect someone and I\'m around here at the most dangerous of times led by a man who\'s never been elected. You\'ve gotta be elected. A political party that\'s in too long is like a piece of meat - if it\'s there too long it will go rotten and they\'ve gone rotten and they\'ve gotta go.      It should have been a hindrance, but I have a phrase which I taught my children: \'Use the difficulty.\' Where I came from, nobody even knew what a drama school was, and everyone thought you couldn\'t become an actor unless you talked posh. Class is still there but it\'s less relevant now. You don\'t need to have gone to a certain kind of school to have done that [become an actor] like you did back then.      My father said nothing, but I know that he thought I\'d just confessed to being gay. Back then, everyone thought all actors were gay, and most of them were right. But it must have been the right move - did you know that the only good word you can make from \'Michael Caine\' is \'cinema\'? I discovered that in a crossword 10 years ago.      The Government has taken tax up to 50 per cent, and if it goes to 51, I will be back in America. I will not pay the Government more than I get. No way, ever. They\'ve reached their limit with me, and that\'s what will happen to a lot of people. You know how much they made out of that high taxation all those years ago? Nothing. But they sent a mass of incredible brains to America. This return to high tax will only deepen our debt. While top-earners will be hit by the highest tax in 20 years, our MPs escape Scot-free. We\'ve got three-and-a-half million layabouts laying about on benefits, and I\'m 76, getting up at 6am to go to work to keep them. Let\'s get everybody back to work so we can save a couple of billion and cut tax, not keep sticking it on.      I shared a flat with Terence Stamp. I understudied Peter O\'Toole. I remember being in Liverpool and going to see a matin\xe9e with a young actor nobody had ever heard of called Albert Finney. Oh, a tremendous wave. It was ridiculous. I knew a writer who wanted to write musicals called Lionel Bart, a painter called Francis Bacon.      What you have now which you didn\'t have when I was young is drugs. You had alcoholism, people getting pissed, but you never had the drugs and that is a massive problem. We were shooting in Hackney and someone local came up to me and said, \'Welcome to Crackney!\' It was a gentler time when I was young. There were vicious gangsters but they were professional gangsters. They chose who they hit and what they robbed. But the drug addicts today have to kill anybody - it doesn\'t matter who - to get the money, so you get this incredible random violence. When I was young you fought the guy in the next street. But it wasn\'t so vicious then. We fought with our fists. Now they fight with knives and guns.      [on John Wayne] Every now and then, we used to meet and have a drink or lunch. He genuinely liked me and of course I adored him. I met him by accident in the lobby of the Beverly Hills Hotel. Many years later, Shakira (Caine\'s wife) was in hospital with peritonitis and John coincidentally was in the next room, dying of cancer. I was around with him at the end. We used to walk up and down the corridor.      (On composer John Barry during filming of Deadfall (1968)) Look at him, he\'s so thin. You wouldn\'t think he had a bloody note in him!      [on prisons] If you put people in cages, don\'t be surprised if they become animals.      I once read, \'You must not compete against your predecessors or your contemporaries. You must compete against yourself.\' I try to look for something better and better and better.      I refuse to take myself too seriously. I learnt that from Roger Moore many years ago. He said, \'Cheer up, you\'d better have a good time because this is not a rehearsal. This is life - this is the show.      If parents aren\'t working, how can they be decent role models? You have to look at all the people who are not sick, who\'ve been on benefits for 20 years and have ten kids. I read in the news that we now spend more in benefits than we collect in income tax. I can\'t think of any country in the world that\'s ever done that. There can\'t be six million people who are too sick to go to work. You can\'t be accused of attacking the working classes, because they\'re not working.      Schools are cheaper than prisons. They don\'t need to learn Shakespeare (William Shakespeare); they need to read and write and count, so make sure of that. But we need to bring back the old technical colleges where you went to learn how to be an electrician, a plasterer, a carpenter.      I stayed in Britain, but they kept putting the tax up, so I\'d do any old thing every now and then to pay the tax, that was my tax exile money. I realised that\'s not a socialist country, it\'s a communist country without a dictator, so I left and I was never going to come back. Maggie Thatcher (Margaret Thatcher) came in and put the taxes back down and in the end, you know, you don\'t mind paying tax. What am I going to do? Not pay tax and drive around in a Rolls Royce, with cripples begging on the street like you see in some countries?      I\'ll probably vote Conservative. I mean, we\'re in a terrible state whichever way you look at it, socially, financially and politically, so just give the other guy a chance. I don\'t know what Cameron\'s (David Cameron) going to do, but in the end you vote out of desperation. You just have to have someone new and see what happens. I voted for Maggie Thatcher (Margaret Thatcher) because I thought we needed a change from that long period of socialism; I voted for Tony Blair because we had a great long period of Conservatism. The thing now is to vote for Cameron (David Cameron).      I know there are thousands of actors out there who are as good, and better, than me, who just didn\'t get the breaks. I\'m not saying that I didn\'t deserve any of this but I\'m also aware of the fickle nature of this business, and how being in the right place at the right time can change everything.      My Alfie (1966) had to ask, \'What\'s it all about\', as he was a bit stupid. Jude\'s Alfie (2004) was too smart, too clever by half. I can understand why he said yes to the part, it probably seemed like a good idea at the time. An actor\'s life is full of decisions, some bad, some good.      When they said they wanted to remake Sleuth (1972), my first thought was, \'Why make it again at all?\' I do not like remakes. It shows a lack of imagination. But once I saw the script for Sleuth (2007) I realised it wasn\'t a remake at all. It was a brand new movie.      The thing about gangsters in films these days is that they\'re either funny or they\'re stupid. Well, I\'m sorry, but I\'ve never met a gangster that\'s either. And I come from something of a gangster milieu. Nor have I met someone who deals out violence for violence\'s sake. The violence in Get Carter (1971) was incisive, fast and over. One blow, one shot, one hit, what was necessary. No one smashed people up in a sadistic fury.      One of the odd things about the country today, odd for me to say it, is the obsession with celebrity. I do regard that as a little bit dangerous. Everyone expects too much of you, too much perfection. And then you get the shock headlines when you realize they\'re normal, we\'re all normal - J-Lo\'s got cellulite shock, and the rest - well, frankly, who gives a shit?      I left the country for eight years when tax was put up to 82 per cent. You didn\'t get the 82 per cent tax from me for eight years. You didn\'t get any tax at all from me for the next eight years. Apart from that, a quarter of a billion dollars of movies were made outside this country instead of inside it which is just from one stupid, loud-mouth moronic actor. Imagine what is happening to companies, proper companies, who then disappear. It\'s no good.      I never give advice to younger actors. Because when I was their age, I used to ask actors older than me for advice, and the only advice I got was ""Just give up.""      [on the death of Tony Curtis] It was a terrible shock and instantly I remembered the first time I\'d met him. I was at a party, it was in winter and there was a fire and I was chain-smoking at the time, smoking a lot of cigarettes. I was stood there talking to someone and suddenly I felt a hand in my inside pocket and they took out my cigarettes and chucked them in the fire. I looked up and it was Tony Curtis. I\'d never met him and he was very famous. I said, \'What did you do that for?\' And he said, \'You\'re going to die Michael if you keep doing that.\' I didn\'t give them up then but I did give them up eventually.      [on Marlon Brando\'s sending a surrogate to the 1973 Academy Awards to pick up his Best Actor Oscar for The Godfather (1972)] I think if the man wants to make a gesture, I agree entirely with what he did. But I think he should have stood up and done it himself instead of letting some poor little Indian girl [Sacheen Littlefeather] to take the boos. And if, you\'re going to make a humanitarian gesture, I think a man who makes $2 million playing the leader of the Mafia should at least give half of it to the Indians.      [on one good reason for winning an Oscar] It might mean I\'d get more scripts without other actors\' coffee stains on them.      [on Sean Connery] We\'re still friends. I phoned him the other day on his 80th birthday, but we never see each other because he doesn\'t move around a lot now. He won\'t make another film now, no. I just asked him. He said, \'No, I\'ll never do it.\'Harry Brown (2009) wasn\'t a movie I wanted to do. It was a movie I HAD to do. I saw a lot of myself in the character and that is what drew me to the role.      Unlike my other golfing friend Sidney Poitier, Sean Connery is not the gentlest person in the world and my lack of grasp of the sport would not make him sad as it did Sidney, it would just make him angry. Sean has a terrible temper and when he tried to teach me golf he was so incensed by my performance he grabbed my club and broke it in two. I\'ve never played since and I never will because I do not want to upset two of my best friends, Sean, in particular.      Today I\'m in the fortunate and luxurious position of only working when I want to. I don\'t like getting up early or spending a long time learning lines, so these days I only work with offers that I really can\'t refuse. It\'s very different from the way I used to be. From the age of 20 to the age of 29, I was obsessed with becoming an actor and when I finally got to Hollywood, I could never quite believe that I had made it and so I kept on working for fear it would all disappear on me. These days, I don\'t think like that at all. I don\'t see myself as a Hollywood movie star - in fact I don\'t see myself as anything in particular.      The danger is, of course, that the wait for a decent movie makes you desperate, and I got desperate to the point that I accepted a picture in Alaska with Steven Seagal, the martial arts expert. The movie was called On Deadly Ground (1994) and the title was to prove apt. Although Steven and the rest of the team were great to work with, I had broken one of the cardinal rules of bad movies: if you\'re going to do a bad movie, at least do it in a great location. Here I was, doing a movie where the work was freezing my brain and the weather was freezing my arse.      [on Bullet to Beijing (1995)] It was my worst professional experience ever. The filming itself was a joke. The final blow came when we were shooting in the Lenfilm studio itself. I wanted to go to the toilet and they directed me to it. I could smell it 50 yards away and it was the filthiest lavatory I have ever seen. I went outside and relieved myself against the sound stage, which I noticed several other men had done before. So this is where my career has ended, I thought to myself: in the toilet. I\'m done.      I think life has got to develop as you get older and I don\'t want to be wandering along doing the same old thing. I want more out of life.      I\'m always supremely confident as a movie actor and my own view of myself is that I\'m a highly skilled movie actor.      I love comedy. I love to make people laugh. If I hadn\'t been an actor, or an architect, which I really wanted to be, I\'d have been a stand-up comic.      [When I was evacuated during the war, I spent a brief period with a family who exercised] a mild form of child abuse [by locking me in a cupboard. My mother found out after a fortnight and took me away,] but it was long enough to leave a mark, which formed part of my psyche for the rest of my life. I have never trusted an adult until a great deal of investigation has gone into them. I trust everyone on the surface, but directly anything starts to go deeper in the relationship, I\'m very mistrusting. Even now. Because of what happened to me as a child. Maybe that\'s why I am a controlling person. I usually control the environment I\'m in, but my control is very quiet and subtle.      [Roger Moore] does the two things I hate most. I love children but I could never do what Roger\'s doing. My idea of hell is long airplane flights. My other idea of hell is giving speeches to strangers. He does both all the time.

I\'ve always got to have one impossible dream on the back burner. The one I\'ve had for a long time is to write a screenplay from the novel I\'ve written. And direct it, and star in it. It\'s an impossible dream. But if you think of my life, there are so many impossible dreams that have come true for me that no dream is ever impossible any more as far as I\'m concerned.      People always told me ""you can\'t be an actor, you don\'t talk posh."" And I said, ""I\'ll show you how to be an actor without talking posh"". And I did it.

So my charity goes towards children. If I were ever to do another charity, I would do it for the homeless. That\'s the other thing that bugs me, the homeless. But for me, it\'s mainly the children. I care very much about them.      I do a lot of charity work, but never for adults. I don\'t like grown-ups very much.      If I made a film like The Swarm (1978), I would make three very quickly before it came out, so I always survived failure - because I had a hit. People say: \'Why did you do Jaws: The Revenge (1987)?\'. They paid me $1million for 10 days... I come from a very poor background so I wanted to do everything for everyone.

He is also the secret identity of the crime-fighting Vigilante known as the Batman.Bruce Wayne was raised in the fictional city of Gotham where has parents owned Wayne Enterprises, employing some 170,000 people. When Bruce was a young boy he witnessed the tragic murder of his parents, by the criminal Joe Chill, late one night after leaving a theater (where the movie ""Zorro"" was playing). He was put in the custody of the Wayne family butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Bruce grew up enraged and traumatized by his parents death. Years later when Wayne was in his early 20\'s, he took to crime fighting as a way to deal with his anger, as well as avenge his parents. One evening whilst brooding over his inability to intimidate criminals, a bat came flying through the window of his study at stately Wayne Manor. This event sparked the idea of donning a frightening bat-like costume. The concept of a bat-themed suit resonated with Bruce due to his childhood fear of bats and the memory of his father wearing a bat costume to a masquerade party.Bruce Wayne has appeared as Batman in comic books, graphic novels, novels. cartoon series, television series, animated films, and feature films since his creation in 1939 by cartoonists Bob Kane and Bill Finger.""']","[u'The Joker', u'""Appearing to be the most evil, deranged, and flat out psychotic killer of all comic book villains, The Joker is the primary antagonist of Batman. He is the complete opposite of Batman, in everything from appearance (Batman tends to be a rather large and muscular man, while The Joker is typically a man of average height or even taller possessing a skinny frame), to ideals. The Joker views murder as sport, and will not hesitate to toy with his food before he eats it, even if said food are the men he has hired to work for him. As intimidating as he is psychotic, he still manages to recruit hordes of henchmen despite his maniacal insanity.The Joker\'s physical appearance is a polar opposite of that of Batman. Batman uses dark colors such as gray and black to intimidate criminals, while The Joker relies on bright colors, such as purple, green, and sometimes orange to do his bidding. The Joker also has a melted cliche clown face, the origins of which differ depending on the continuity he is used in. Some incarnations of The Joker see him wearing actual make up (such as in the film ""The Dark Knight""), while others show his skin actually having been bleached (as in the 1989 ""Batman""). He also traditionally has green hair and red lips, to complete the look of the psycho clown.His methods are unpredictable and incalculable. He does things according to his own twisted sense of logic, and does not desire money. If there was one thing that he did desire, it would be the power to instill anarchy into Gotham by any means necessary, proving that organization is meaningless and futile. He is an exceptionally intelligent man, and this tends to be his greatest weapon against Batman, the police, and the District Attorney\'s office. He is often confronted by the authorities, but easily evades capture due to sick and twisted mind games he plays on them, all full of mystery. While Batman prefers to stay in the shadows, The Joker basks in the spotlight, often broadcasting himself to the public and media outlets.Though he may be Batman\'s undisputed arch-nemesis, The Joker has always held some kind of respect for Batman, saying in ""The Dark Knight"", ""Why would I kill you? What would I do without you?"". He also acknowledges that Batman will never kill him, as that is Batman\'s only rule, and since The Joker will not kill Batman, they are truly destined to fight forever. As The Joker says, ""This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.""Throughout the course of The Joker\'s involvement in Batman\'s film and television appearances, he has had many different and diverse interpretations. In the 1960\'s, Cesar Romero portrayed the character as a campy, funny, strangely psychotic, yet harmless killer. In 1989, Jack Nicholson played The Joker in a somewhat human way and fashionable to the comics, however upped the ""killer"" aspect of the character, as well as the quick temper. He also possessed bleached skin in the film, and received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. In the early to mid 1990\'s, Mark Hamill voiced the character as icy cold and cruel, vastly different from Nicholson\'s character interpretation.In 2008, however, The Joker was taken in a direction he had never been taken before. In ""The Dark Knight"", the late Heath Ledger portrayed The Joker as a completely psychotic and demonic killer, a sort of Nietzschean superman, with no moral attachment towards anybody but sees Batman as true value to himself. Any humor that the character shows is sardonic and cruel. Ledger\'s Joker was a personification of disregard and chaos. His primary goal seems to be to prove that people, in dire situations, are just as sick and horrible as he is. This Joker\'s most frightening and dangerous asset is his intelligence. Ledger was honored with a posthumous an Academy Award, a BAFTA and a Golden Globe Award for his performance.In all his shapes and forms, The Joker remains as one of the scariest and most ingenious of all comic book villain history.One of his proudest achievements was turning the well-respected psychiatrist Dr. Harleen Quinzel into his criminal sidekick and \'girlfriend\' Harley Quinn. She is madly in love with him; whether or not he returns her feelings is a constant discussion of debate among fans.In 2016, the Clown of Prince of Crime returns, albeit in a small role in the 2016 film, Suicide Squad played by Jared Leto.""']","[u'Two-Face', u'""Once a high-profile District Attorney for Gotham City, Harvey Dent was horribly disfigured by an attack made during the indictment hearing of crime boss Salvatore ""The Boss"" Maroni. After confronting Maroni with evidencelinking him to the murder of a small-time bookie -- most notably Maroni\'s lucky double-headed coin, which hehad accidentally left behind at the scene of the crime -- an enraged Maroni threw a vial of sulphuric acid into his face, burning the left side while leaving the right half of his face untouched.Miraculously, Dent survived this attack but still bore the acid scars on the left side of his face. Driven insaneby his traumatic experience, Dent developed a seperate, more violent personality known as Two-Face, which drove him to embark on a life of crime.Two-Face is obsessed with duality, and almost all of his crimes are based around the number two. A notablequirk of his is his dependance on the use of Maroni\'s double-headed coin, one side of which he has marred with a knife to reflect his own conflicted personality. The result of a coin toss can be a matter of life or death to his victims, as he uses the coin to determine whether he will perform an act of good or evil in a given situation.In The Dark Knight, Harvey Dent is pitted in the role of lead District Attorney for Gotham. Labeled as Gotham\'s ""White Knight,"" Harvey has been working with Rachel Dawes as they attempt to purge Gotham\'s criminal underworld, attempting to restore order to the once proud city. Harvey also carries a double-sided coin with him as a lucky charm.During dinner one evening, Harvey is introduced to Rachel\'s friend, Bruce Wayne. As the discussion turns to the Batman, Harvey makes a passionate speech of how much he wants to help Gotham, and that the Batman most likely isn\'t going to want to keep doing the fight forever. These words impress Bruce, who agrees to throw Harvey a political fundraiser, promising that his friends will make sure that when the time comes, Harvey\'s re-election will be in the bag.Harvey Dent eventually meets with James Gordon. Though Harvey knows there are some corrupt cops in Gordon\'s special unit, he also suspects that Gordon has been working in secret with the Batman, and wants in on their plan. Gordon eventually decides to let Harvey in on their plan to seize the Mob\'s money...only to find that the Mob\'s accountant, a man named Lau, has taken the funds and secretly moved them to an undisclosed location. Harvey and Jim eventually contact Batman, who goes after Lau on Harvey\'s word that he\'ll be able to get him to \'talk.\'Once Lau has been returned to Gotham (as to how, Harvey denies any knowledge to the press), Rachel Dawes handles the questioning of the accountant. Lau works out a deal in which he won\'t surrender the mob\'s money, but will tell who his clients are. Lau is held in Gordon\'s unit to eventually testify against the mob members, who total some 500+ people. All of them are brought into the courtroom, much to the surprise of the Mayor. The Mayor chastises Dent\'s move, but Dent explains the reasoning: The higher-level mobsters will make bail, but the middle-men won\'t, and they\'ll be the ones that will help in this situation. The Mayor is still cautious, cautioning Dent that this plan will make him a target now.A few days later, Harvey attends the fundraiser Bruce promised to throw, at the millionaire\'s swanky penthouse apartment in Gotham. Dent is a bit off-kilter at the session, and Bruce makes a few jokes at the expense of Harvey\'s campaign slogan, but Harvey is a bit more reassured when Bruce explains that Harvey really is the man who says what he means.Also at the function, Harvey manages to get Rachel alone, trying to get her to give an answer, if she will consider marrying him. Rachel claims she is still unsure, but before Harvey can ask more, he is subdued by Bruce (due to the Joker and some thugs that have come for Harvey). Harvey is hidden, and released after the Joker and his men have left.However, the attempt on Harvey\'s life was one of three attempts. Two other persons in on the case have been killed: Police Commissioner Loeb (due to a poisoned drink), and Judge Surillo (killed by an explosion in her car). It appears the case may be over, as the deaths of these two high-profile figures has some running scared. Dent surprises Gordon\'s unit when instead of hiding, he storms in, demanding that Lau testify as soon as possible. However, given the situation, Lau refuses, claiming that they can\'t protect him.A few days later, a public funeral is held for Commissioner Loeb. The Joker has threatened to kill the Mayor, and extra security is called out. However, the Joker and some men disguise themselves, and almost succeed, but instead, end up hitting Jim Gordon.In the aftermath, Harvey encounters one of the shooters in an ambulance, chained to a stretcher. The man is disguised as a Gotham officer, but it is the name tag on the uniform that catches Dent\'s eye: Rachel Dawes. When Dent gets no additional information from the shooter, he hijacks the ambulance with the man inside, and drives to a hidden location.Once there, Harvey calls Rachel, explaining that she isn\'t safe. Rachel then tells Harvey she\'ll go to Bruce Wayne\'s penthouse to stay safe. Harvey then attends to the shooter, having tied him to a chair. Harvey uses a loaded gun, and his lucky coin, attempting to frighten the man to telling what he knows about the Joker. Harvey is suddenly stopped by Batman. Batman then explains that in order to stop the bloodshed, Harvey will hold a news conference the next day, and he (Batman) will turn himself in. This decree upsets Harvey, who yells, ""You can\'t give in!"" as Batman walks away.The next day, Harvey holds a press conference. He attempts to reassure the public, but the people in the room appear to be in favor of Batman turning himself in. In a rather shocking turn of events, Harvey claims that he is the Batman, and is taken into custody.Harvey is taken to Gordon\'s special unit, where he is prepared to be taken to the County Jail. Rachel eventually meets Harvey, who explains that he is acting as bait to lure the Joker out of hiding, and that when he strikes, Batman will take him down. Rachel pleads with Harvey to reconsider, but Harvey kisses her, and gives her his lucky coin.As expected, Harvey\'s transport is interrupted by the Joker, an also as expected, Batman appears to apprehend the Joker. However, their wild card comes into play when Jim Gordon assists in apprehending the Joker...having faked his death to protect his family.In the aftermath, Harvey is taken away, but does not make it home. Instead, Harvey awakes, tied up in a room filled with oil barrels, and a wired phone. Harvey can hear Rachel on the other end, and is informed that there wouldn\'t be enough time to save them both, and that \'their friends\' would decide who lives. Harvey attempts to free himself, but in the process, ends up spilling an oil drum, and falls to the floor, the left side of his face and body being covered in the substance. As he struggles to right himself, Batman bursts through the door. Thinking that Batman chose him over Rachel(The Joker gave Batman the locations, but mixed up who was where), Dent is shocked, and calls out Rachel\'s name as he is dragged from the building. Batman is able to drag Dent outside before the building explodes. However, fire from the explosion ignites the chemicals on the left side of Dent\'s body.Dent is taken to the hospital, where he eventually wakes up, to find his lucky coin on a beside table. Seeing one side clean, he assumes that Rachel survived. Upon turning the coin over, and seeing the other side scarred, Harvey cries out, and rips off the medical coverings on the left side of his face.Harvey refuses any further medical treatments, choosing to remain in intense pain. Jim Gordon goes to talk to Harvey, to find out more information about who took Harvey and Rachel. However, Harvey deep down harbors a grudge against Gordon, thinking that because Gordon refused to take care of corrupt officers in his unit, this is the reason for Rachel\'s death. Gordon claims he\'s sorry, but Harvey simply responds, ""No. No you\'re not...not yet.""Some time afterward, Harvey awakes to find the Joker at his bedside. Harvey attempts to attack the clown, but is restrained to his bed. Harvey blames the Joker for what happened to him and Rachel, but the Joker claims that he\'s innocent: he was locked up in Gordon\'s police unit, so he couldn\'t have rigged the explosives. The Joker then attempts to play a mind game on Harvey, claiming that chaos is a fair and just way to expound justice. The Joker then tells Harvey this, by placing a gun in his hand, and allowing him to kill him. Harvey, however, relies on his coin to decide. The coin comes up clean, and the Joker\'s life is spared. Harvey is then let free, and heads off to seek retribution for his pain.Harvey first tracks down Detective Wuertz. Wuertz claims he doesn\'t know who picked up Rachel, but assumes it must have been one of Salvatore Maroni\'s henchmen. Harvey passes judgement on Wuertz with his coin, and when the coin lands on the scarred side, he kills the Detective.Harvey next sneaks into Salvatore Maroni\'s car, questioning him as well. Maroni explains to Harvey that Rachel\'s driver was Detective Anna Ramirez. Harvey then flips his coin twice. The first for Maroni: who turns up clean. The second for Maroni\'s driver: which turns up scarred. Harvey then kills the vehicle\'s driver, and the vehicle flips over (presumably killing Maroni as well).Harvey next goes to Ramirez, who tricks Gordon\'s wife into taking herself and her kids to a safe location (which happens to be the same location where Rachel was killed). Ramirez pleads that she didn\'t know what was going to happen, and due to her Mother\'s hospital bills, she went along with the scheme. However, her pleading falls on deaf ears as Harvey flips his coin. It lands clean-side up, and he spares Ramirez\'s life, but knocks her out, before heading to the location.Once there, he holds Jim Gordon\'s kids and wife at gunpoint, before calling Jim. Jim eventually arrives at the location, where Harvey explains that he is planning to punish Gordon for his failure to stand up to corruption, which presumably led to Rachel\'s death. Noting how Gordon reacts as he points the gun at the various family members, Harvey, pulls aside Gordon\'s son, intent on killing him. ""Then, you can tell me you\'re sorry,"" says Harvey.Batman shows up, hoping to reason with Harvey. Harvey reasons that this is not about what he wants, but about what is \'fair,\' claiming the world is cruel, and fate is always just a game of chance. Batman explains that it wasn\'t chance that Rachel was killed: all of them chose to go ahead with the plan (Batman, Gordon, even Dent). Batman then claims Dent should point the gun at those responsible.Dent then decides to do so, starting with Batman. his coin flips to the scarred side, and he shoots Batman, who falls to the ground. Dent then flips the coin for himself, and it comes up clean (causing him to look pained). When it comes to Gordon\'s turn, Dent is still intent on shooting Gordon\'s son. Gordon pleads again, claiming that Rachel\'s death was his fault, and to punish him instead of his son. Dent explains that his son\'s death will be punishment enough. However, before the coin flip is completed, Batman (who survived the shot), tackles Dent, knocking him over the side of the building. Batman manages to save Gordon\'s son, but Harvey appears to have died.In the aftermath, Harvey\'s plans to convict the mob will fall apart if word gets out about what he did (it is claimed that Dent killed 5 people, 2 of them cops). As Harvey could be seen as a deranged killer, the mob could use this as a way to declare him incompetent. Batman chooses to take the blame for what Harvey did, and Harvey is buried, considered a hero, as a way to give the people of Gotham hope.""']","[u'Alfred Pennyworth', u'""Alfred Pennyworth was the butler in service of the Wayne family. He had been Bruce Wayne\'s guardian and, above all, his best friend.He served in the British Special Air Service (SAS) when he was younger. In one mission, he was dispatched with a unit to negotiate with the Burmese government and bribing them with jewels, but were constantly ambushed by a bandit who kept stealing the jewels. It wasn\'t until they found a kid playing with one of the jewels stolen from them, a ruby the size of a tangerine, that they discovered that the man stole the jewels simply because he wanted to cause chaos; Alfred later reflected that some men are looking for nothing but ""to watch the world burn"". They later caught the person by burning down his forest. At some point in time, Alfred relocated to Gotham City, where he became a butler for Thomas and Martha Wayne at stately Wayne Manor.Eight years after the death of Harvey Dent, Alfred assists Bruce in finding out information about the mercenary, Bane. However, the two become distanced from one another when Alfred uses Rachel to demotivate him from becoming Batman once more. Alfred also explains that he burnt the letter Rachel addressed to Bruce that outlined she intended to marry Harvey and not Bruce. This leads to Alfred leaving Wayne Manor on Bruce\'s orders. Over Bruce\'s grave, Alfred breaks down in tears and apologizes to Bruce\'s parents having failed to protect their son. However, when Alfred returns to the Florentine restaurant, he looks across to see Bruce dining with Selina Kyle and they exchange smiles to one another and nod. At this point Alfred leaves happy and joyful that Bruce is alive and that he has finally found peace and starting a family.""']","[[<bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nWe've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the\nDark Knight.

With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman \r\nfranchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, \r\namped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more \r\ngripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times \r\nthroughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to \r\nfight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if \r\nhis crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his \r\nfractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the \r\nhelp of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael \r\nCane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But \r\nthe real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly \r\nenemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack \r\nNicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. \r\nHe is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY \r\ndisturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime \r\nand Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original \r\ncast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal \r\nand more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a \r\nmuch better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" \r\nstereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in \r\nfilms. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around \r\nmore so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly \r\nimproved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" \r\nin addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.\r\n\r\nAlso worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the \r\nfilm an added frosting to an already delicious cake.\r\n\r\nSimply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The \r\naction is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud \r\nChristopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who \r\nsadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing \r\nin Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may \r\nfeel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I \r\nwill say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor \r\nhim in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a \r\nhuman being and father to his daughter Matilda \r\nLedger.

His transformation will put\nTommy Lee Jones' portrayal look like children's breakfast cartoons.\nGyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both Bale and Eckhart, Michael\nCaine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batman's 'conscience' and of\ncourse, Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid.<br><br>There are some major differences between The Dark Knight and Begins.\nFirstly, the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the\n'majestic but unfinished' tones of Begins - but it suits the film's\ntone: Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain\n(compared with the many in Begins) - but there was also a lot more\nhenchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more\nefficient - as mentioned in the film, learning through experience.<br><br>I was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film, it just felt\nlike a loose thread and wasn't quite closed up or explained, and the\nending, while it wasn't what I expected (others have said that it was\npredictable, but for me it wasn't) was solid and suited the film well.<br><br>All in all, this is a film that is quite close, if it isn't already, a\nmasterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous\n'Superhero' adaptations (Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example),\nthere isn't campiness creeping in. In face, if Batman Begins was 10/10,\nThe Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply, the best possible sequel\nthat could've been given.<br><br>If you watch this (which I implore that you do), you certainly won't\nregret it. One of the best movies of 2008 (I'll wait till Quantum of\nSolace comes out before I pass judgement) - but certainly a film worth\ngetting excited for. If you don't like it, then that's also fine - but\nkeep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good\nmovie, so the rest of us won't take it to heart.<br><br>Stunning in every aspect, and exceeds all hype and expectation... Can't\nwait to watch it again, or for the Blu-Ray!\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nI thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together \r\nmovie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new \r\ninsight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in \r\nhis role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an \r\nhonest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting \r\nperhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.\r\n\r\nBut after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be \r\nviewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN' \r\nMASTERPIECE of a superhero film.\r\n\r\nTo say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would \r\nbe akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'.\r\n\r\nWhile watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is \r\nusually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not \r\nactually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical \r\nmusings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over \r\nin favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants \r\nto explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical \r\npace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to \r\ndo, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the \r\nviewer's interest.\r\n\r\nAnd that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of \r\nbig action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff \r\ngoing on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and \r\nthere's some great hand-to-hand stuff too.\r\n\r\nBut what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is \r\nbrilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first \r\ntwo-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down \r\nto the cast.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val \r\nKilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and \r\ncommitted as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us \r\nfeel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose \r\nit's pretty appropriate.\r\n\r\nHeath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and \r\nthought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar? \r\nIs that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get \r\none for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died? \r\nBut...well...how can I put it...? \r\n\r\nIt seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero, \r\nbut after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just \r\nlooks...well...lame.\r\n\r\nIf you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you \r\nneed to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.\r\n\r\nMaggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first \r\none (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more \r\nemotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was \r\nnecessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with \r\nBatman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such \r\ngarbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She \r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nAs does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to \r\nsay my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you \r\nget the idea.\r\n\r\nMichael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz.\r\n\r\nMorgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.\r\n\r\nGary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics. \r\nAbsolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath \r\nand Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular \r\ntalent. Go Gaz.\r\n\r\nEric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister!\r\n\r\nThe whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed \r\nentertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and \r\naction.\r\n\r\nI've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman &amp; Robin), \r\nbut this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary.\n</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nBatman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time\nI heard about him because he his human with no powers, also he is much\nmore questionable than any other superhero.

The title is good because that is what\nBatman actually is. It has been 3 years for the adventure to continue\nfrom Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is\nvery Gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. The whole movie\nis charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and\nriveting performances from a first-rate cast especially from Heath\nLedger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for best\nsupporting-actor. It is a shame that he can't see his terrific work\non-screen. The cinematography is excellent which is made so dark &amp;\nsinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Usually sequels\ndon't turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is\none of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The\nGodfather 2.

Christopher\nNolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most\nfavourite films. He hasn't made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already\non the IMDb top 250.

Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and\nthe new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight\nwants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of\ntheir corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind\nknown as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The\nJoker's plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos,\nand kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which\nmakes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous\ncriminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength\nand vigilance to defeat him.<br><br>(My Comment) This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural\nas Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred, the\ntrusted butler. Heath Ledger's performance as the sadistic Joker was\nabsolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to\nmeet the Joker in a dark alley, and whatever you do, don't ask him how\nhe got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. Ledger's\nperformance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image.\nBetween all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good\nsinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells\nthe story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with\nbeing the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the\ndifference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the\ncode or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The\nmovie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain, as well as\nOrder verses Anarchy, and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one\nyou must have the other, and because of that, they will always be\nconnected. The movie is long, but it went by so fast. You will love the\nlast 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new\nsonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions, body count, and the\ndark mood of the movie, I don't think parents should take young\nchildren. (Warner Bros.

The Dark Knight\nlives up to it's hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that\ngoes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real\nsold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are,\nhow all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman's skin,\nhow you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth.\nHeath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson's performance in the\n1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark\nKnight, I was like ""What are they, kidding?"", once you see The Dark\nKnight... Heath was incredible! I'm not going to compare Jack and\nHeath's performance, because they were two different versions of the\nJoker, but Heath's Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of\nthe two nominations. You didn't know what he was going to do next, he\nwas so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could\nrelate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he's\ncrazy, he's driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little\npuppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it\nso well with a smile on his face. <br><br>This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a\ncomic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action,\nromance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a\ndetective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan,\nwho's previous film, Batman Begins, didn't really thrill me, but his\nincredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots\nthat he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel\npart of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I\nabsolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic\nbook movie, you know it's not real, people don't dress up in costumes,\nand save the day, villains don't name themselves crazy names and dress\nin make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it\nseem incredibly real, like it could happen.<br><br>Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman\nand himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey\nDent, he's inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are\ntrying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are\nmuch worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he's going to bring\nHell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham's mind and trying\nto get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a\npsychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the ""Classy\nVillain that Gotham needs"", he also has brought a new thought into\nBatman's head of them actually being more alike than different, that\nBatman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But\nBatman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham's ""White Knight"" trying\nto put all of Gotham's scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman\nand Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very\nhorrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or\nlive long enough to become a villain.<br><br>All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone's going\ncrazy over Heath Ledger's performance, but one performance I would also\nlove to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his\nperformance was just as great as Heath's and made Two Face a human\nvillain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened\nto him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this\nbut I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen\nin a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but\nI think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don't\nwanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater\nexpecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though\nthis is not a great movie, I can't come up with a word describe how\nincredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10\nrating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting\nfor. I've seen it twice in one weekend, I'm going to see it three times\nthis upcoming week, I don't mind one bit. I can't wait for the sequel\nand I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his\nbreath taking performance as The Joker.<br><br>10/10\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nI think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares\nabout is this: Is Christopher Nolan's follow up to the critically\nacclaimed 2005 film ""Batman Begins,"" The Dark Knight, as good as\neveryone is saying? Quite simply, yes, yes it is. There is no doubt\nabout it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly\ndeserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary\nsuperhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as\naction orientated as you might expect.<br><br>I will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However,\na basic one sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most\ncunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The Joker.\nNow that that is out of the way, I will start off with the actors (and\nboy, is there a lot to talk about). Christian Bale has done a\ntremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing\neveryone else out of water with ""Batman Begins."" Bruce Wayne has a\nflawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and\ncriminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal\nshift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a\ngadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in\nGotham City and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own\nmedicine. Because of this, and Bale's tremendous acting, Bruce Wayne is\njustified, and we emphasise with Bale's flawed hero more than any of\nthe other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman, this is it.\nThe theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.<br><br>Of course, I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good.\nAnd I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledger's Joker is not\nonly the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His\nperformance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of\nthe previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker\ntruly is Batman's worst villain; cunning and psychotic, nothing quite\nmatches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for\nBest Actor, I honestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to\nsee such a talented actor fall at such a young age...<br><br>All the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has\ndefinitely proved himself previously (""Thankyou for Smoking"") as\nsomeone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he\nis very powerful. All he wants is justice; to bring down every single\ncriminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as\nWayne and Dent's love interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie\nHolmes. Gyllenhaal's performance has substance, I really cared for her\nand her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can\ndo no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and\nemotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited\nrole, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the\nstory. Finally, Gary Oldman's Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least\nneeds a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another\ncrime-fighting hero who faces some challenging situations.<br><br>Wally Pfister's cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never\nlooked so good, so big and deep. His wide shots purvey a dirty aura and\ncontribute to the feel of the film. Without it, it may not have been\nthe same. Another Oscar worthy portion, THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND\nJames Newton Howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? The score sets\nthe mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the\naction sequences it really ups the adrenaline. And on the topic of\naction, The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and\ncar chases in a comic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or over-use\nof CGI, the explosions and accidents are the real deal. Thrilling, edge\nof your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff.<br><br>Nevertheless, none of this would be possible without Christopher Nolan,\nthe man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer (and brother)\nJonathon Nolan, the darkest Batman movie yet is the best, and the best\nso far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film, the\ndialogue and situations feel so realistic. And, it IS the script that\ndrives this film. The dialogue is very, very well written and is the\ncentre of the conflict and the movie.<br><br>It may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all\ntime. There are others that are magnificent (""Superman"" and ""X-Men"" are\ntwo examples) but this is the most complex, the most dark and the most\nspectacular and epic of them all.

The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and\nalter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes.\nPart of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen\ntime, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath\nLedger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that\nenvelopes Gotham as well as us.

In\nfact, it's quite far from such a distinction. It falls short of\nunquestionable excellence because of a ridiculously high number of plot\nholes, most of which regard The Joker and his criminal exploits.<br><br>It is a given that Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker leaves us with\na character who is thoughtful, unpredictable, ruthless, unrelenting,\nand arguably insane. That is to say, some inconsistencies in the\nvillain should be accepted, if not embraced. But others, to be frank,\nare unacceptable because of their stupidity. For example: In the film's\nopening sequence, a clever bank heist spearheaded by The Joker, the\ncrazed clown kills off his partners as the caper progresses. At the\ntime, it made sense. Pretty simple, the more colleagues he kills off,\nthe more money that leaves for him. But later on in the film, The Joker\nburns his half of the criminal underworld's combined fortune. He makes\nit overtly clear that he is not motivated by money. Not in the least\nbit.<br><br>So why was the money a factor in the opening scene? It shouldn't have\nbeen. Uneven scripting there.<br><br>But that's nitpicking in comparison to the film's greater faults. The\nultimate reason why ""The Dark Knight"" falls short of the masterpiece\nlabel is because there is absolutely no way, under any circumstances,\nat any time, on any planet or in any solar system, that The Joker could\nexecute so many complex plans in such a short period of time.<br><br>OK, here is where people start saying: ""But it's a movie! It doesn't\nhave to be possible."" I know, thanks. I agree, it doesn't have to be\npossible. But, and this is a huge BUT, a film as ambitious and lengthy\nas ""The Dark Knight"" wants to be taken seriously. Not only does it want\nto be taken seriously, I think director Christopher Nolan wants Oscar\nconsideration for the work he has put in here, and cast members have\nbeen saying regularly that they don't want this to be considered as a\nmere ""superhero movie,"" or ""action movie."" Well if you want to elevate\nto the level of serious drama, then you have to explain a few things to\nme.<br><br>(1) How does The Joker continue to find willing participants in his\nescapades when all of his previous crew members end up dead or in jail?\nThe guys he's finding to work for him have to be true idiots. Totally\nbrainless. And that doesn't work because The Joker's plans are\nmeticulous and require precise timing and execution. If these goons are\ndumb enough to work for him, they aren't smart enough to be effective\nas help. It's a perpetual contradiction throughout the film,\nparticularly the second act.<br><br>(2) Sure The Joker is swift and tricky, but c'mon, he doesn't exactly\nlook like a normal citizen. If city-wide security has been heightened\nto a level never before seen, how the hell is this maniac with a\npainted face and wacky hair not being spotted? Does he have an\ninvisible transportation machine or something? He doesn't have\nsupernatural powers, so he shouldn't have a supernatural aura.<br><br>(3) When did he have the time to wire the hospital with bombs? Even if\none of his goons did it, how did no one in the hospital notice\nsuspicious activity? What about the assassination attempt on the Mayor?\nThe other cops on the firing line didn't notice the most infamous\nvillain in the city standing right next to them? Why? Because he\ncrouched over a little and tried not to make eye contact with them?\nPlease. I could go on for days, too many plot liberties were taken.<br><br>I'd actually like to discuss the performances a bit. I think the\nseparation between the strongest part and the rest of the cast is the\nlargest ever with an ensemble of this size and magnitude. Meaning,\nHeath Ledger's performance was far and away the best in this film,\nbetter to the point where it bothered me that no one else was in his\nrealm. The scenes where Ledger was off screen lacked the magnetism and\nintrigue of the ones in which he appeared. Although appeared is\nprobably not the best word, more like dominated. <br><br>Christian Bale was OK as Batman, but he's almost too stoic for a\ncharacter with such strong morals and opinions. He's also a little bit\nstiff when he's in playboy mode as Bruce Wayne. I think his performance\nin ""The Prestige"" was more emotional, effective, and polished.<br><br>Aaron Eckhart was all right as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, but the problem\nwas that the vast majority of the time I was seeing Eckhart on screen,\nnot Dent. The same Eckhart we saw in ""Thank You For Smoking."" Also, a\nman with a finely tuned social philosophy, like Dent, would not totally\nflip his ideology after the loss of a close loved one. Hopefully the\nangle is that the toxin causing the disfigurement messed more with his\nbrain than we were led on to believe.<br><br>Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were believable as always, but of\ncourse they are underused as Alfred and Lucius Fox. Gary Oldman\nprobably contributed the second strongest performance in the film as\nCommissioner Gordon, and Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Rachel Dawes) was a step\nup from Katie Holmes as far as execution and timing -- but that's not\nsaying much. <br><br>I really could go on for days about the unacceptable plot liberties,\nbut I'll spare you. All in all, I liked the film because it had some\nthought-provoking sequences involving moral dilemmas and intriguing\nsocietal questions, and in having such ""The Dark Knight"" succeeded in\nescaping the ""superhero movie"" label. But it's not a masterpiece.<br><br>Plain and simply, it has too many holes.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nIm just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my\nfavorites of all time.

Until then, this stands as\nthe best movie I've ever seen\n</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nI saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th\ngrade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera\nwork, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this\nday one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie\ncan impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a\nmovie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time\nand effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money\nputting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our\ntime, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am\nanxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes\naction movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time\nwrite bad reviews about this film.\n</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nThis was the most hyped movie of the year and probably one of the most\nhyped movies ever. Even with the overhype I had to see Heath Ledger\nplay the joker because the trailers looked awesome. So I finally paid\nmy ticket and watched the movie.<br><br>The movie starts off really strong, the opening scene was an absolute\nblast (literally). From that point on though I didn't feel the same\naction. The rest of the movie just seemed, drawn out and completely\nover the top. Honestly where did the joker find a rocket launcher in\nGotham City? This movie was just too long and much of the dialogue was\nsomething that a kid writes in senior creative writing and thinks it's\nbrilliant. Also the director did an excellent job of warping the joker\nfrom one place to the next, the joker must have had a helicopter or a\nreally loyal taxi driver. One second he's here and the next he's on top\nof that building. Probably the last straw was when Morgan Freeman\nshowed up. He turns around and the camera is at a low angle as if to\nshow the arrival of Morgan Freeman the ultimate modern narrator who is\nnow in every movie, an older version of Samuel L Jackson who is soft\nspoken. They kind of made up for it when Debo from Friday showed up as\nthe scary convict on the boat.<br><br>After sitting in my seat for two and half hours as characters appeared\nand disappeared the movie finally ended, and it ended in a very clich\xe9\nway. Way to say the title of the movie as the last word in the film,\nthats never been done ever?<br><br>and The Dark Knight had to include the bain of every modern movie,\nbeing able to track people's cell phone calls. This little gimmick is\nin way too many movie these days.<br><br>so ya I sat there for two and a half house and my butt really hurt, I\nwasted ten dollars on a cool movie, but one that wasn't as good as\npeople claimed. Maybe next time Christian Bale will take some cough\ndrops before showing up on set.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nThe Dark Knight maintained the intensity and overall gunmetal grayish\nfeel that sets this Batman apart. The film takes us to a Gotham City\nthat has grown accustomed to the big bat's crime-fighting crusades, and\nthe last remaining big time criminals have actually grown fearful of\nhis wrath. They form an alliance to attempt to keep their illicit\nbusiness activities alive but are feeling even more pressure from yet a\ndifferent angle: the passionate and fearless new district attorney,\nHarvey Dent. Recognizing the crime group's looming extinction, a\nstranger enters their circle and offers what he thinks is the only\nsolution: kill Batman.<br><br>The bad guys don't know if they can trust this seemingly demented\nmadman, and they later learn the hard way that they don't really have a\nchoice, for the most disturbing part of the Joker's personality is his\nmotive. He doesn't care about money or power. He just enjoys causing\ntrouble and watching, with pleasure, from the sidelines, as the\nterrorized city scrambles in mayhem...which leads me to the real star\nof this film, Heath Ledger.<br><br>Ledger's performance as the Joker is astounding and consuming. We come\nface-to-face with a villain bearing the coldness of a psychopath and a\npersonality that remains as mysterious and inexplicable as the real\nreason for the scars on his face. He develops the air of the lone\noffender quite early on as he nonchalantly kills those who help him\ncommit his crimes. Yet, he has no problem building an army of\nfollowers, and the viewers easily find that believable. As insane as he\nis, he's focused and quite determined. Ledger also brings the Joker's\nhumor to the role, but he does it in a way that is unique to this\ninterpretation...with subtlety and honesty. The very words and\nmannerisms that made me laugh also evoked feelings of sadness in its\nclarity. The evil is incredibly convincing.<br><br>Although Batman is a character that is often marketed towards kids,\nthis film is definitely not appropriate for young children. In addition\nto the dark images, the violence, both seen and implied, is sometimes\nunsettling, and Ledger's Joker is chilling even for adult viewers.\nHaving said that, this is, by far, one of the best films I've ever\nseen, and it will easily find a place in my personal top ten. I am only\ndisappointed that this Joker, the best villain in a film since Hannibal\nLecter, will never be revealed to us again.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nObviously Christopher Nolan was trying to touch on one of the prominent\nissues of recent times. That of the environment. He did this by\nrecycling tired old jokes and set pieces from many action films before,\nand the rest of the plot was salvaged from toilets and rubbish bins. He\nalso comes up with the perfect formula to make a profound sentence, by\ntaking two words that mean complete opposites and shoving them\ntogether.<br><br>Joking aside, after almost nodding off for the first hour and a half\nthe second half of the movie actually was pretty good, albeit drawn out\nuntil the ending which was very frustrating. They literally left the\njoker hanging while dealing with the completely pointless and\nirrational side-story of two-face. I'd have thought that a man of\ndent's resolve would have been made stronger by the events that took\nplace, to get back at the joker and stop such events from happening to\nother people, instead of deteriorating into the monster of similar\ncalibre to the joker.<br><br>I really don't think the film got the best out of the actors involved,\nprobably due to the script. Christian Bale is a fantastic actor, but he\nis completely wasted as batman where he spends most of his time jumping\nabout in a bat-suit using a silly voice, instead of displaying his\nincredible character acting skills in movies such as American Psycho\nand the Machinist. Heath Ledger's performance was the only real solid\none in the entire cast, however at plenty of times he guilty of\ncompletely over-acting. His introduction to the members of the mob was\nfarcical and the laughter in the cinemas was due to the awkwardness and\nstupidity of the situation.<br><br>The main reason I think the film totally fails is Christopher Nolans\napproach of trying to make the film really realistic with an\nexplanation for everything. A man running around in a bat costume and a\nman dressed up in clown make-up is just to surreal to try and be\naddressed in this manner. This is why I think the original Batman is a\nlot better because it didn't try to be ultra-realistic and took the\ncomics and had a fairly serious tone with a very comedic undercurrent.\nChristopher Nolan undoubtedly has talent as a director, memento, the\nprestige and even insomnia are all great films but I feel his attempts\nat the batman franchise are far outshone by Tim Burton.<br><br>Obviously the film is already a hit and there is nothing anyone can\nwrite to stop it from being so, however I must implore you to actually\nwatch the film critically and realise its shortcomings, than get swept\naway in the hype.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nI settled on a 5/10 for The Dark Knight. I appreciated the story\nstructure and all the notes they hit... I just don't think they played\nthem loudly. I don't like re-casting, and the replacement of Katie\nHolmes/Rachel and the original Barbara Gordon actress (yes, her too,\ndidya notice?) is awkward and distracting. The lack of ANY blood in the\nfilm to complement the multitude of beatings and killings (to sustain a\nPG-13 rating) nullifies the tension that should be present in some\nbrilliantly conceived scenarios. I didn't believe for a second that the\nvictims of several hostage situations (mass or otherwise) would\nactually lose their lives, because it's blisteringly apparent from the\nonset that this film is a PG-13, and would never disturb its audience\nbeyond the minimum necessary plot points. <br><br>The Joker is actually underwritten. Ledger was game and his performance\nsolid, but honestly: Throw the makeup and stringy hair on 75% of\ncapable actors out there, and you have the same product.

The defense and the prosecution have rested and the jury is filing into the jury room to decide if a young man is guilty or innocent of murdering his father. What begins as an open-and-shut case of murder soon becomes a detective story that presents a succession of clues creating doubt, and a mini-drama of each of the jurors' prejudices and preconceptions about the trial, the accused, and each other.

He was the first-born child. His father was a Russian Jewish immigrant, and his mother was born in New York, to Russian Jewish parents. Martin caught the acting bug in high school where he participated in the drama club. After high school, he continued his interest in acting by attending Manhattan\'s progressive New School. When World War II broke out, Martin was called to service in his early twenties. After the war, he was lucky to secure a position as an usher at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. By 1947, he was honing his craft at the Actors Studio, run at that time by Elia Kazan and Lee Strasberg. His time at the Actors Studio in New York City allowed him training in the famous Stanislavsky method. Despite his excellent training, he had to prove himself, just like any up and coming young actor. He began on Broadway in the late 1940s. But, it was not until 1951 that he experienced real success. That play was Tennessee Williams\' ""The Rose Tattoo"". After his Broadway success, he had a few minor television roles before his big break arrived when he joined the cast of On the Waterfront (1954). In the 1950s, Martin had many television roles. He had recurring roles on some of the most popular television series of that time, including The United States Steel Hour (1953), The Philco Television Playhouse (1948), Goodyear Television Playhouse (1951) and Studio One (1948). In 1957, he was able to prove himself on the big-screen once again, with a prominent role in 12 Angry Men (1957), directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Henry Fonda. All of Martin\'s television work in the 1950s did not go to waste. While starring on an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955), Hitchcock was so impressed by his work, that he offered him a key supporting role of Detective Milton Arbogast in Psycho (1960). His work with Hitchcock opened him up to a world of other acting opportunities. Many strong movie roles came his way in the 1960s, including parts in Breakfast at Tiffany\'s (1961), Cape Fear (1962) and The Carpetbaggers (1964). One of the proudest moments in his life was when he received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for A Thousand Clowns (1965). It was soon after that he began accepting roles in European movies. He soon developed a love for Italy, and lived there most of his remaining years. He acted in over a dozen Italian movies and spent his later life traveling between Hollywood and Europe for his many roles. After a career that spanned more than fifty years, Martin Balsam died of natural causes in his beloved Italy at age 76. He passed away of a heart attack at a hotel in Rome called Residenza di Repetta. He was survived by his third wife Irene Miller and three children, Adam, Zoe and Talia.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Irishlass240 (smmorr240@aol.com)          Spouse (3)               Irene Miller          (1963            - 13 February\xa01996)\xa0(his death)\xa0(2 children)           Joyce Van Patten (18 August\xa01957            - 14 August\xa01962)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)           Pearl Somner (1952            - 1954)\xa0(divorced)          Trivia (24)      Father of actress Talia Balsam, from his marriage to Joyce Van Patten.

Many know the bald-pated Fiedler as therapy patient ""Mr. Peterson"" on The Bob Newhart Show (1972); others might first recognize him for the 1968 movie, The Odd Couple (1968), and spin-off TV show, The Odd Couple (1970), or perhaps even from the Broadway play that preceded them. Even kids would know that helium-high voice from animated Disney features like Robin Hood (1973), The Fox and the Hound (1981) and the ""Winnie the Pooh"" stories, in which he voiced ""Piglet"". The son of an Irish-German beer salesman, Fiedler knew he wanted to be an actor from his childhood days, when he had a full head of reddish-yellow hair. He made his first professional appearances onstage, branched out into live TV in New York and, then, during the 20 years he lived in Hollywood (1960-80), he turned up in many movies and an ever greater number of popular TV shows.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Tom Weaver <TomWeavr@aol.com>          Trade Mark (1)        High-pitched, nervous voiceTrivia (16)      Known as Johnny Fiedler during his radio days.      Portayed Homer on NBC Radio\'s ""The Aldrich Family"" (1952-1953).      According to his obituaries he was survived by his brother, James Fiedler and a sister, Mary Dean.      Has the impressive distinction of being the only actor to give voice to his character (Piglet) in all the different animated versions of Winnie the Pooh from Walt Disney, from Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968) all the way through to Pooh\'s Heffalump Movie (2005). Incredibly, his total credits for playing Piglet were in twenty-three distinct different productions, several of those having multiple episodes.      Served in the U.S. Navy during WWII.      Diagnosed with cancer, he became a patient of the Lillian Booth Actor\'s Fund Home in Englewood, New Jersey, in November of 2004 and died there the following June.      Provided the voice of ""Piglet"" for the Pooh series from 1968, with Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968), until shortly before his death. Walt Disney, himself, heard Fiedler\'s voice and hand-picked the actor. Ironically, Fiedler died one day after voice specialist, Paul Winchell, who voiced the role of ""Tigger"".      Father was a beer salesman.      Used to stage productions in his family garage with neighborhood children.      Played the same character, Mark Lindner, in the original Broadway production of Lorraine Hansberry\'s play ""A Raisin in the Sun"" in 1959, the subsequent Hollywood film (A Raisin in the Sun (1961)), and in the television production of the play, (American Playhouse: A Raisin in the Sun (1989)).      Was a keen bridge player in real life.      He did the voice of Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner for the Captain America Returns record album.      Along with Carole Shelley and Monica Evans, he is one of only 3 actors to appear in both The Odd Couple (1968) and the subsequent television adaptation The Odd Couple (1970).      Fiedler has stated that the role he is asked about the second most often is that of ""Mr. Peterson"" on The Bob Newhart Show (1972) and the one he is most asked about is that of the mild-mannered police official who is temporarily taken over by the spirit of ""Jack the Ripper"" in the Star Trek: Wolf in the Fold (1967) episode of the original Star Trek (1966) series.

Cobb, one of the premier character actors in American film for three decades in the post-World War II period, was born Leo Jacoby in New York City\'s Lower East Side on December 8, 1911. The son of a Jewish newspaper editor, young Leo was a child prodigy in music, mastering the violin and the harmonica. Any hopes of a career as a violin virtuoso were dashed when he broke his wrist, but his talent on the harmonica may have brought him his first professional success. At the age of 16 or 17 he ran away from home to Hollywood to try to break into motion pictures as an actor. He reportedly made his film debut as a member of Borrah Minevitch and His Harmonica Rascals (their first known movie appearance was in the 1929 two-reeler Boyhood Days), but that cannot be substantiated. However, it\'s known that after Leo was unable to find work he returned to New York City, where he attended City College of New York at night to study accounting while acting in radio dramas during the day.An older Cobb tried his luck in California once more, making his debut as a professional stage actor at the Pasadena Playhouse in 1931. After again returning to his native New York, he made his Broadway debut as a saloonkeeper in a dramatization of Fyodor Dostoevsky\'s Crime and Punishment, but it closed after 15 performances (later in his career, Dostoevsky would prove more of a charm, with Cobb\'s role as Father Karamazov in The Brothers Karamazov (1958) garnering him his second Oscar nomination),Cobb joined the politically progressive Group Theater in 1935 and made a name for himself in Clifford Odets\' politically liberal dramas Waiting for Lefty and Til the Day I Die, appearing in both plays that year in casts that included Elia Kazan, who later became famous as a film director. Cobb also appeared in the 1937 Group Theater production of Odets\' Golden Boy, playing the role of Mr. Carp, in a cast that also included Kazan, Julius Garfinkle (later better known under his stage name of John Garfield), and Martin Ritt, all of whom later came under the scrutiny of the House Un-American Activities Committee during the heyday of the McCarthy Red Scare hysteria more than a decade later. Cobb took over the role of Mr. Bonaparte, the protagonist\'s father, in the 1939 film version of the play, despite the fact that he was not yet 30 years old. The role of a patriarch suited him, and he\'d play many more in his film career.It was as a different kind of patriarch that he scored his greatest success. Cobb achieved immortality by giving life to the character of Willy Loman in the original 1949 Broadway production of Arthur Miller\'s Death of a Salesman. His performance was a towering achievement that ranks with such performances as Edwin Booth as Richard III and John Barrymore as Hamlet in the annals of the American theater. Cobb later won an Emmy nomination as Willy when he played the role in a made-for-TV movie of the play (Death of a Salesman (1966)). Miller said that he wrote the role with Cobb in mind.Before triumphing as Miller\'s Salesman, Cobb had appeared on Broadway only a handful of times in the 1940s, including in Ernest Hemingway\'s The Fifth Column (1940), Odets\' ""Clash by Night"" (1942) and the US Army Air Force\'s Winged Victory (1943-44). Later he reprised the role of Joe Bonaparte\'s father in the 1952 revival of Golden Boy opposite Garfield as his son, and appeared the following year in The Emperor\'s Clothes. His final Broadway appearance was as King Lear in the Repertory Theatre of Lincoln Center\'s 1968 production of Shakespeare\'s play.Aside from his possible late 1920s movie debut and his 1934 appearance in the western The Vanishing Shadow (1934), Cobb\'s film career proper began in 1937 with the westerns North of the Rio Grande (1937) (in which he was billed as Lee Colt) and Rustlers\' Valley (1937) and spanned nearly 40 years until his death. After a hiatus while serving in the Army Air Force during World War II, Cobb\'s movie career resumed in 1946. He continued to play major supporting roles in prestigious A-list pictures. His movie career reached its artistic peak in the 1950s, when he was twice nominated for Best Supporting Actor Academy Awards, for his role as Johnny Friendly in On the Waterfront (1954) and as the father in The Brothers Karamazov (1958). Other memorable supporting roles in the 1950s included the sagacious Judge Bernstein in The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (1956), as the probing psychiatrist Dr. Luther in The Three Faces of Eve (1957) and as the volatile Juror #3 in 12 Angry Men (1957).It was in the 1950s that Cobb achieved the sort of fame that most artists dreaded: he was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee on charges that he was or had been a Communist. The charges were rooted in Cobb\'s membership in the Group Theater in the 1930s. Other Group Theater members already investigated by HUAC included Clifford Odets and Elia Kazan, both of whom provided friendly testimony before the committee, and John Garfield, who did not.Cobb\'s own persecution by HUAC had already caused a nervous breakdown in his wife, and he decided to appear as a friendly witness in order to preserve her sanity and his career, by bringing the inquisition to a halt. Appearing before the committee in 1953, he named names and thus saved his career. Ironically, he would win his first Oscar nomination in On the Waterfront (1954) directed and written by fellow HUAC informers Kazan and Budd Schulberg. The film can be seen as a stalwart defense of informing, as epitomized by the character Terry Malloy\'s testimony before a Congressional committee investigating racketeering on the waterfront.Major films in which Cobb appeared after reaching his career plateau include Otto Preminger\'s adaptation of Leon Uris\' ode to the birth of Israel, Exodus (1960); the Cinerama spectacle How the West Was Won (1962); the James Coburn spy spoofs, Our Man Flint (1966) and In Like Flint (1967); Clint Eastwood\'s first detective film, Coogan\'s Bluff (1968); and legendary director William Wyler\'s last film, The Liberation of L.B. Jones (1970).In addition to his frequent supporting roles in film, Cobb often appeared on television. He played Judge Henry Garth on The Virginian (1962) from 1962-66 and also had a regular role as the attorney David Barrett on The Young Lawyers (1969) from 1970-71. Cobb also appeared in made-for-TV movies and made frequent guest appearances on other TV shows. His last major Hollywood movie role was that of police detective Lt. Kinderman in The Exorcist (1973).Lee J. Cobb died of a heart attack in Woodland Hills, California, on February 11, 1976, at the age of 64. He is buried in Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. Though he will long be remembered for many of his successful supporting performances in the movies, it is as the stage\'s first Willy Loman in which he achieved immortality as an actor. Bearing in mind that the role was written for him, it is through Willy that he will continue to have an influence on American drama far into the future, for as long as Death of a Salesman is revived.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Jon C.

He was a member of the famed Borrah Minevitch and His Harmonica Rascals, who appeared in the 1928 film, The Patriot (1928) starring Lewis Stone, and directed by Ernst Lubitsch.      Was succeeded in two of his roles by the late George C. Scott. Cobb died shortly after playing Lt. Kinderman in The Exorcist (1973). Scott took over the part in the third film. Cobb played Juror #3 in 12 Angry Men (1957) and Scott played that part in the television remake 12 Angry Men (1997). Scott also played Willy Loman in the Broadway revival of ""Death of a Salesman,"" a part Cobb originated.      Father of Julie Cobb who was married to James Cromwell.      The part of Willy Loman in the stage play ""Death of a Salesman"" was written specifically for him by Arthur Miller.Arthur Miller offered him the lead role of Eddie Carbone in his Broadway play ""A View from the Bridge."" While an outsider might think that the politically progressive Miller would be hostile to the actor due to Cobb\'s friendly testimony before the infamous House Un-American Activities Committee, during which he ""named names,"" Miller thought Cobb would be ideal for the role. Himself a target of the witch hunt for alleged Communists undertaken by the government, Miller believed that Cobb would bring real intensity to Carbone, who informs on his relatives to the immigration service, as he himself had been an informer. Cobb turned down the role, as he believed that to accept it would open him up to retaliation from the reactionary right and jeopardize his career.      Appeared with Harry Morgan, the father of his future son-in-law Christopher Morgan, in How the West Was Won (1962).      Former father-in-law of Christopher Morgan.      Grandfather of Rosemary Morgan.William Link and Richard Levinson, creators of TV\'s ""Columbo"", initially wanted Cobb to portray Lt. Columbo, but he was unavailable.      His performance of \'King Lear\' in 1968 is the longest-running production of the play in Broadway history.      In his autobiography ""Timebends,"" Arthur Miller says that Lee J. Cobb was his favorite Willy Loman. He also says that Cobb was never really a leftist as he was apolitical, but that he had been attracted to left-wing and anti-Nazi causes during the Depression as had many people who were trying to do right. Thus, Miller never held the fact that he was a friendly witness before HUAAC against him. A decade after his testimony, Cobb\'s Willy Loman was captured for posterity, with the 1966 video version. By then, Miller had even worked again with Elia Kazan, the most famous and unrepentant of the people who knuckled under and ""named names.""      Was a good friend with screenwriter Alvah Bessie, a Communist Party member who was one of the Hollywood 10, until Cobb refused to lend him $500 in the late 1940s. Bessie had been ruined financially by legal fees connected to his appeals of his contempt citation issued by the House Un-American Activities Commission (HUAC). Bessie and other members of the Hollywood 10 braved the Committee\'s inquisition into communists and fellow-travelers in the film industry by refusing to cooperate. When Cobb told him that $500 wouldn\'t solve his problems, their friendship was over. Cobb later turned out with hundreds of sympathizers of the Hollywood 10 to show their support for the members who were flying to Washington, D.C. for their trials on charges of contempt of Congress levied by HUAC. Later, Cobb would be a friendly witness before HUAC, naming names of fellow former communists and leftists from his Group Theater days in New York in the 1930s.      Featured in ""Bad Boys: The Actors of Film Noir"" by Karen Burroughs Hannsberry (McFarland, 2003).      Was the original choice to play Mickey in ""Rocky"" but refused the role because he would have to audition.      Suffered a near-fatal heart attack in August 1955 while filming The Houston Story (1956).      Was just 4 years older than Frank Sinatra, who played his son on Come Blow Your Horn (1963).Personal Quotes (7)      We all want to play romantic figures.

[interview with Victor Navasky for the book ""Naming Names"", about the McCarthy ""Red Scare"" witch-hunts of the 1950s] When the facilities of the government of the United States are drawn on an individual it can be terrifying. The blacklist is just the opening gambit - being deprived of work. Your passport is confiscated. That\'s minor. But not being able to move without being tailed is something else. After a certain point it grows to implied as well as articulated threats, and people succumb. My wife did, and she was institutionalized. In 1953 the HUCA did a deal with me. I was pretty much worn down. I had no money. I couldn\'t borrow. I had the expenses of taking care of the children. Why am I subjecting my loved ones to this? If it\'s worth dying for, and I am just as idealistic as the next fellow. But I decided it wasn\'t worth dying for, and if this gesture was the way of getting out of the penitentiary I\'d do it. I had to be employable again.      [testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee, June 23, 1953] I would like to thank you for the privilege of setting the record straight, not only for whatever subjective relief it affords me, but if belatedly this information can be of any value in the further strengthening of our Government and its efforts at home as well as abroad, it will serve in some way to mitigate whatever feeling of guilt I might have for having waited this long.      The theater is the actor\'s medium. Movies are the director\'s medium. Television is nobody\'s medium.      If you must compare, Loman is a half-beaker as against Lear\'s full, overflowing beaker of poetry and emotion. The great difference is that in a production of Lear there is challenge to continual growth. There is no such thing as perfection.      Willy Loman is nobody\'s hero, but we are all his bereaved.      There was no living until I played Willy Loman. Willy Loman is part of my existence.

Instead of following the\ntrial itself, the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind\nthe closed doors of a jury room. The film begins with the end of the trial.\nThe jurors retire to deliberate the case. A preliminary vote is taken and\nthe result is 11:1 in favour of the guilty verdict. Eleven jurors have\nraised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father. Only Juror\n#8 has doubts. At first even he does not truly believe the young man to be\ninnocent but notes (rightfully) that the case for the defence might have\nbeen presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given\nthe benefit of a doubt. Since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his\nlife is now in the hands of the jury and juror #8 reasons that the least\nthey could do is talk about the case a bit. As time goes on some of the\njurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable\ndoubt not to convict the young man after all. But not everyone is easy to\nconvince.<br><br>Although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see\nwhat\nlittle things can influence which way a verdict goes, where this film\nreally\nsucceeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors. The character of\neach of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting,\nexcellent dialogue and near-flawless acting.<br><br>Juror #1 - a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity\nof the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let\nanyone else find this out. He appears at ease only once during the film -\nwhen he talks about football. He has the misfortune to be selected foreman\nof the jury - a task he clearly does not relish.<br><br>Juror #2 - a small, quite man, clearly unaccustomed to giving his own\nopinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance.\nApparently\nhe finds solace in his job - he is an accountant.<br><br>Juror #3 - probably the most complex personality in the film. Starts off\nlike a pleasant self-made successful businessman, he analyses the case\nimpartially, explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. As\ntime goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow\npersonally involved with the case.  He also starts to show some signs of\nslight mental instability. Wonderfully played by Lee J. Cobb - this is the\ncharacter you remember after the film is over.<br><br>Juror #4 - self assured, slightly arrogant stockbroker. Obviously considers\nhimself more intelligent than anyone else in the room, he approaches the\ncase with cool heartless logic but (as one of the jurors says - ""this is\nnot\nan exact science"") he does not take into account the feelings, the\npassions,\nthe characters of the people involved in the case. He is conspicuous by the\nfact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off (it is a\nvery hot day).<br><br>Juror #5 - here is a man under great emotional stress. He comes from the\nsame social background as the accused boy - with who he almost unwillingly\nseems to identify with. Paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons\nfor him voting guilty - he does not want compassion to influence him - so\nironically it does.<br><br>Juror #6 - a simple man, quite readily admitting that everyone in the room\nis better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations.\nBut\nhe really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a\nmistake.<br><br>Juror #7 - the only one that really has no opinion on this case. Literally\nthroughout the film his thoughts are never on the case - he talks of\nbaseball, of the heat, of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for\nvoting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of\nthe jury room as soon as possible. Not an evil man he just has no sense of\nmorality whatsoever - he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to\nthink it's worth the bother.<br><br>Juror #8- a caring man, has put more thought into the case than any of the\nother jurors. He tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly\nimpossible odds.<br><br>Juror #9 - a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique\nway of looking at the case.<br><br>Juror #10 - the most horrifying character in the film. Votes guilty and\ndoes\nnot even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy's\nsocial background. The tragedy comes from the fact that his own social\nposition is only a cut above the boy's - which makes him all the more eager\nto accentuate the difference.<br><br>Juror #11 - an immigrant watchmaker, careful methodical man, well mannered\nand soft spoken. respects the right of people to have different opinion to\nhis - and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. Loses his temper\nonly once - horrified by the complete indifference of juror\n#7.<br><br>Juror #12 - a young business type - perhaps he has his own opinions - but\nis\ncareful to hide them. What he has learnt out of life seems to be that\nintelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people\nthink.<br><br>The film succeeds in doing something very rare today - developing an\nintelligent plot while also developing 12 believable, memorable and\ndistinct\ncharacters.\n\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nThis film is superb, in fact as Shakespeare once said ""Its the bees' knees"".\n The film captivates the audience from the beginning.

Yet they also feel the shame\nof the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron\ntight, joining his side as members of the jury do.<br><br>On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the\nmisconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between\ndifferent characters.

Eleven of\nthe men believe the boy to be guilty; only one (Henry Fonda) has\ndoubts. Can he manage to convince the others?<br><br>The court case provides only a framework, however. The film's greatness\nlies in its bringing-together of twelve different men who have never\nmet each other before and the interaction of their characters as each\nman brings his own background and life experiences into the case. Thus,\nwe have the hesitant football coach (Martin Balsam), the shy, uncertain\nbank clerk (John Fiedler), the aggressive call company director (Lee J.\nCobb), the authoritative broker (E.G.

I made an effort to see it as it is rated as\none of the best movies ever made, however I must admit that I watched\nit with a sense of reluctance as I'm not a great one for old\n""classics"". This film blew me away however; how ignorant can I be about\nold films? How many other pre-1960s gems are there out there that I\nhaven't seen? What strikes me most about this film is how progressive\nit is for its day. Indeed the issues this film makes about American\nsociety of the 1950s, still ring true for western society today. This\nfilm concerns twelve jurors debating the sentence of an 18 year old\nPuerto Rican boy who on the face of it, has no real alibi. However one\nman, played brilliantly by Henry Fonda, is ill-at ease putting a young\nboy to death without even debating his case, much to the despair of the\nother jurors. What follows is a brilliant piece of film making, slowly\nrevealing many of the juror's complex characters to the audience as\nthey react to Fonda's concerns with their own mix of metal scars,\nprejudices and insecurities. What especially struck me about this film\nis how ordinary most of the characters are, none of the jurors are\nshown to be especially bad men, indeed most are portrayed as honest\neveryman type people. The use of ordinary characters is the films\nmaster-stroke because as one by one they begin to question their\ninitial instincts, the flaws of society that have let this Puerto Rican\nboy down are presented to the audience. Tragically it appears that many\nof the issues that were beginning to be discussed in the 1950s have\nonly got worse. For me there is one immortal comment in this film: one\nof the jurors, a man in his 50s says that the youths of today have no\nrespect and have changed so much for the worse since his day. How\nironic is it that some grumpy old men of today who may not even of have\nbeen born when this films was made, still say exactly the same thing?\nFinally a quick look at the cast shows that Fonda aside many of the\ncast were only moderately successful after this film. I think that's a\nshame as everyone of these actors is excellent and plays their part in\nmaking it one of the best films of all time. However within the cast\nthere are a couple of treats; look out for Jack Klugman (Quincy) and\nJohn Fieldler who is the voice of many of Disney's characters such as\nPiglet.

To 11 jurors it's\nan open and shut case - guilty.

But with a cast as uniformly excellent as this, why quibble?\nHenry Fonda is just the person to play the liberal everyman, an\nextension of his Tom Joad character from ""The Grapes of Wrath."" E.G.\nMarshall is excellent as Fonda's most formidable opponent; cool-headed\nand logical, he's the only holdout who bases his verdict on facts\ninstead of emotions. Lee J.

The acting was top-notch all-around, especially with\nJuror #9. The product ends up being not very preachy, which is a\nconsiderable achievement given that it's built entirely around a simple\nparable.<br><br>With the benefit of hindsight, though, one can see a few things about\nthis that I personally find really disturbing.<br><br>The question that drives the movie is whether the jurors have properly\nawarded the defendant the benefit of any reasonable doubt, and as the\nclimax approaches, the attention given to this reaches a fevered pitch.\nLeft behind in the dust, is the equally critical question of whether\nthe defendant is really guilty. There's a scene early on when Jack\nWarden, the juror who just wants to get the voting over with so he can\nwatch a ball game, meets Henry Fonda in the washroom. The last two\nlines in that scene discuss the possibility that the boy may be\nacquitted, even though he is guilty. Fonda says something to the effect\nof ""that very well may be"" or some such, and to my recollection this is\nthe last time this possibility is even considered.<br><br>The jury may have released a murderer onto the streets. You can make\nthe argument that with the presence of reasonable doubt, this was their\njob. I agree. But as Henry Fonda walks down the courthouse steps to\nresume his everyday life as an architect, would it really then be\nfitting to have the happy ""a wrong has been righted"" swelling-orchestra\nmusic, as our hero walks proudly among his fellow citizens with his\nhead held high? Doubt or no, conviction or no, this kind of\npeace-of-mind is not lying in wait for you after your last day on a\nreal jury. There are jurors who want it anyway, and because of that,\nwill not convict anyone. They have seen this movie, and want to be\nHenry Fonda. I've served with them. It's a pretty serious problem.<br><br>There is a short speech given by Fonda shortly after he is revealed to\nbe the one juror who wants to acquit. Several times in the speech he\nmakes the point that the defendant is poor, has had a rough background,\nand has been beaten up a lot. It is not entirely clear where he is\ngoing with this, since the movie is supposed to be about what is\nreasonable doubt, and how the doubt applies regardless of economic\nclass. There is at least one other juror who wants to convict because\nthe defendant is poor; does Fonda mean to say with a defendant who was\nwealthier, he himself would have voted to convict? That doesn't seem\nlikely at all. But then why bring it up? It means something to other\njurors, but it isn't supposed to mean anything to Fonda. The only way\nit could support any of Fonda's arguments, is if he was making\ndecisions based on the way those decisions made him feel about himself,\nrather than based on the evidence. This is something jurors aren't\nsupposed to do.<br><br>Four years after this movie was made, the Supreme Court defined the\nExclusionary Rule in Mapp v. Ohio. So by this time, you weren't\nsupposed to convict anyone unless you knew they were guilty beyond any\nreasonable doubt, and in addition to that, if you knew too much, then\nyou still couldn't convict. During the sixties, conviction became such\nan unlikely goal even when the evidence seemed compelling, that a lot\nof District Attorneys refused to make arrests even though they knew a\nsuspect posed a significant danger to society.<br><br>By the seventies, Americans were so fed-up with the ""justice system\nfailing us"" that they began turning politicians out of office in bulk,\nhoping against hope they could fix what was broken before their own\nchildren were murdered or their wives were raped. Between Vietnam and\nWatergate, this was a third salvo against our fragile faith in\ngovernment, and it was an erosion of our trust that we don't talk about\ntoo much today.<br><br>What really concerns me is that a little while after this film was\nmade, with the poorest Americans being forced to live among violent\npeople and thus becoming increasingly interested in vigilantism,\nsuddenly we had a huge surge in movies about ""Taking the law into your\nown hands."" Dirty Harry, Death Wish, and countless made-for-TV\nprojects. In summary, the pendulum swung in one direction, then a few\nyears later, the other. Hollywood got to make money both times.<br><br>I have trouble getting completely behind this film because it's a\nconcentrated effort, ultimately a successful one, to get that pendulum\nswinging wildly. If we spent that relatively short amount of time, just\nfifteen years or so, leaving ""revolution"" out of it and reforming our\njustice system in baby steps, the mistakes of the past could have been\navoided. I do not know if it was possible to fix what was broken back\nthen, by doing this -- convictions weren't always carefully considered\nback in the 1950's &amp; earlier. But a lot of innocent people would be\nalive today if all those violent felons, in subsequent years, were\narrested like they should have been.<br><br>I would say, if you're going to serve on a jury, by all means rent this\nbecause it's a very meticulous and passionate reminder of your civil\nduty, it makes some great points, and everything in this movie is\nhighest-quality. But also on your required-viewing list would be Primal\nFear, the Richard Gere movie. Better yet, watch that one last, so the\nfinal scene really sticks in your mind.<br><br>Nobody should be serving on a jury, if they can't seriously consider\nthe consequences of releasing people who are really guilty of violent\ncrimes.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nIt's tough sometimes to translate a stage production- which 12 Angry\nMen essentially is- into a feature film, with in this case one cramped\nroom and a dozen characters with totally varied ideals.

In the process the jurors\nwill get to understand the meaning of justice.<br><br>This drama owes Henry Fonda a debt of gratitude. We can't think of any\nother actor playing this juror. Mr. Fonda exudes kindness and he is the\nonly person in the room that is not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt\nthe boy has killed his own father. Not only did he make a contribution\nas an actor, but also helped produced the movie.<br><br>Lee J. Cobb, one of the great American actors of the last century, is\nseen as a juror that sees in the accused young man his own estranged\nson, who he hasn't seen in a couple of years, having left home because\nof the conflict with the old man. Mr. Cobb is just the opposite of Mr.\nFonda, and he gives an intense performance to show us this man in\nturmoil. The rest of the cast is wonderful. Each one has his own moment\nto shine.<br><br>There is not a single moment that rings false in the movie. In reading\na couple of comments about ""12 Angry Men"", some people marvel there\nwere no women in the jury, or that the accused man's case hasn't been\npresented by the defense attorney in a more effective way. We have to\nremember first of all, the times in which the action takes place, and\nthe fact that being a poor man, the accused man has been given an\nattorney who was obviously not interested in his defense. The young man\nbeing from a minority migrant group didn't elicit sympathy from these\njurors, at all, which might have been the prosecution's goal in going\nalong with the selection.<br><br>This is a movie that should be seen by anyone serving in a jury in a\ncourt of justice. Mr. Lumet and Mr. Rose have created a timeless film\nthat will be the standard in which everything else is judged.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><a href=""reviews-enter"">Add another review</a></p>>]]"

                    In German-occupied Poland during World War II, Oskar Schindler gradually becomes concerned for his Jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the Nazi Germans.
            ","

Oskar Schindler is a vainglorious and greedy German businessman who becomes an unlikely humanitarian amid the barbaric German Nazi reign when he feels compelled to turn his factory into a refuge for Jews. Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler who managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp, it is a testament to the good in all of us.

Liam worked as a forklift operator for Guinness, truck driver, assistant architect and an amateur boxer. He had originally sought a career as a teacher by attending St. Mary\'s Teaching College, Newcastle. However, in 1976, Neeson joined the Belfast Lyric Players\' Theater and made his professional acting debut in the play ""The Risen People"". After two years, Neeson moved to Dublin\'s Abbey Theater where he performed the classics. It was here that he was spotted by director John Boorman and was cast in the film Excalibur (1981) as Sir Gawain, his first high-profile film role.Through the 1980s Neeson appeared in a handful of films and British TV series - including The Bounty (1984), A Woman of Substance (1984), The Mission (1986), and Duet for One (1986) - but it was not until he moved to Hollywood to pursue larger roles that he began to get noticed. His turn as a mute homeless man in Suspect (1987) garnered good reviews, as did supporting roles in The Good Mother (1988) and High Spirits (1988) - though he also starred in the best-to-be-forgotten Satisfaction (1988), which also featured a then-unknown Julia Roberts - but leading man status eluded him until the cult favorite Darkman (1990), directed by Sam Raimi. From there, Neeson starred in Under Suspicion (1991) and Ethan Frome (1993), was hailed for his performance in Woody Allen\'s Husbands and Wives (1992), and ultimately was picked by Steven Spielberg to play Oskar Schindler in Schindler\'s List (1993). The starring role in the Oscar-winning Holocaust film brought Neeson Academy Award, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor.Also in 1993, he made his Broadway debut with a Tony-nominated performance in ""Anna Christie"", in which he co-starred with his future wife Natasha Richardson. The next year, the two also starred opposite Jodie Foster in the movie Nell (1994), and were married in July of that year. Leading roles as the 18th century Scottish Highlander Rob Roy (1995) and the Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins (1996) followed, and soon Neeson was solidified as one of Hollywood\'s top leading men. He starred in the highly-anticipated Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) as Qui-Gon Jinn, received a Golden Globe nomination for Kinsey (2004), played the mysterious Ducard in Christopher Nolan\'s Batman Begins (2005), and provided the voice for Aslan in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005).Neeson found a second surprise career as an action leading man with the release of Taken (2008) in early 2009, an unexpected box office hit about a retired CIA agent attempting to rescue his daughter from being sold into prostitution. However, less than two months after the release of the film, tragedy struck when his wife Natasha Richardson suffered a fatal head injury while skiing and passed away days afterward. Neeson returned to high-profile roles in 2010 with two back-to-back big-budget films, Clash of the Titans (2010) and The A-Team (2010), and returned to the action genre with Unknown (2011), The Grey (2011), Battleship (2012) and Taken 2 (2012), as well as the sequel Wrath of the Titans (2012).Neeson was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1999 Queen\'s New Year\'s Honours List for his services to drama. He has two sons from his marriage to Richardson: Micheal Richard Antonio Neeson (born June 22, 1995) and Daniel Jack Neeson (born August 27, 1996).- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Tony Fontana <tony.fontana@spacebbs.com>          Spouse (1) Natasha Richardson (3 July\xa01994            - 18 March\xa02009)\xa0(her death)\xa0(2 children)          Trade Mark (6)        In his career\'s recent years, Neeson has very often taken roles in which he is a mentor/trainer/father figure to a younger man, as in, for example: Batman Begins (2005), Kingdom of Heaven (2005), Gangs of New York (2002) and Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999). His character often must die early in the movie and/or the student\'s life so that the young man can apply the Neeson character\'s lessons to his own ongoing struggle.

Was a boxer as a teenager in Northern Ireland, which resulted in getting his nose broken at age 15. Nevertheless, he went on to win the Irish Youth Championship. However, a brief blackout after one of his fights caused him to give up the ring for good.      Won a libel case against newspapers that claimed that his marriage was in trouble. [October 1998]      Ranked #69 in Empire (UK) magazine\'s ""The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time"" list. [October 1997]      First worked with his future wife, actress Natasha Richardson, on the miniseries Ellis Island (1984).      Son-in-law of actress Vanessa Redgrave and Tony Richardson.      Was considered for the role of James Bond in GoldenEye (1995), which went to Pierce Brosnan.      Attended Queen\'s University of Belfast for a short while to study physics and computer science, but flunked out.      Brother-in-law of Joely Richardson.      Was connected to David Lean\'s production of ""Nostromo,"" but withdrew before preproduction began and Lean\'s subsequent death.      He was considered for the role of Van Helsing in Dracula (1992) (and reportedly very much wanted the role). However, he was turned down after Anthony Hopkins showed an interest in the role and ultimately got the role.      Has worked repeatedly with Laura Linney, including in Kinsey (2004), Love Actually (2003), and in a Broadway revival of ""The Crucible"", playing husband and wife in Kinsey (2004) and ""The Crucible"". The two have joked about feeling like ""an old married couple"".      Wanted to be in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) so badly, he did not even bother reading the script.      Attended and graduated from the Gaiety School of Drama in Dublin, Ireland.      Is a member of the Dublin Shakespeare Theatre Festival, where his past credits include ""Hamlet"", ""King Richard II"" and ""All\'s Well That Ends Well"".      He recalled his most embarrassing moment in acting as when, relatively early in his career, he auditioned for the role of Fezzik, the giant in The Princess Bride (1987). Director Rob Reiner had a look of disgust on his face when he realized that Neeson was ""only"" six-feet-four. Andr\xe9 the Giant ended up getting the role.      Was chosen for the role of Gawain in Excalibur (1981) primarily because director John Boorman wanted a large man in the role for the duel between Gawain and Lancelot (Nicholas Clay). It was on this film where he met Helen Mirren, who was playing Morgana.      Auditioned for, and was accepted by, the Bristol Old Vic Drama School in England, but decided to attend the Gaiety School of acting instead so he could stay active with the Dublin Shakespeare Festival while in school.      Was an honorary board member of the CDS (Conference of Drama Schools) in England, which also included Sir Anthony Hopkins, Brian Cox, Richard Harris, Peter O\'Toole and Jeremy Irons, to name a few. The board oversaw all drama schools in England.      During the 1990s, he was very active with the Royal National Theatre in London, where he performed a wide range of Shakespeare\'s works.      Was twice nominated for Broadway\'s Tony Award as Best Actor (Play): in 1993 for a revival of Eugene O\'Neill\'s ""Anna Christie"", and in 2002 for a revival of Arthur Miller\'s ""The Crucible"".      It was his role in Shining Through (1992) as a high Nazi party official that got him noticed by Steven Spielberg, and that eventually led to him being cast as Oskar Schindler in Schindler\'s List (1993).Schindler\'s List (1993) is ranked #3 on the American Film Institute\'s 100 Most Inspiring Movies of All Time.      Was Oliver Stone\'s first choice for the role of King Philip of Macedonia in Alexander (2004), which went to Val Kilmer.      Was considered for the role of Count Dracula in the cult classic The Monster Squad (1987), which went to Duncan Regehr.      In an interview with the BBC, he said that Northern Irish Protestant minister Ian Paisley influenced his decision to become an actor. Neeson used to sneak into the church in his hometown, Ballymena, and watch Paisley preach. ""He had a magnificent presence and it was incredible to watch this six-foot-plus man just Bible-thumping away. It was acting but it was also great acting and stirring too"".      On March 16, 2009, his wife Natasha Richardson suffered a brain injury in a skiing accident. On March 18, 2009, she died in a hospital. Liam interrupted filming of his movie Chloe (2009) to be by her side.      Received an honorary doctorate from his alma mater, Queen\'s University of Belfast, at the British consulate on May 6, 2009, in New York.      Friends with Ralph Fiennes, Henry Herman and Ciar\xe1n Hinds.      Appeared with Daniel Day-Lewis in The Bounty (1984) and Gangs of New York (2002). Neeson later appeared on stage as John Proctor in a 2002 production of ""The Crucible,"" a role played by Day-Lewis in the 1996 film version of the play. After dropping out of Steven Spielberg\'s biography of Abraham Lincoln, Neeson was replaced by Day-Lewis.      Regarding some rumors saying that he ""felt like a puppet while working on Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999),"" Neeson said, ""That\'s simply not true,"" and that he had ""absolutely no misgivings"" about being in ""Star Wars,"" adding that Lucas was ""very good"" to work with. ""He was clear about what he wanted,"" said Neeson.      Suffers from acrophobia (""I get dizzy on a thick carpet,"" he once quipped to Jay Leno).      Neeson is a National Goodwill Ambassador to Ireland.      Is a huge fan of boxing and said that Muhammad Ali was the most famous boxer he ever met. Was an amateur boxer, a sport he started participating in at the age of 9. He had his last fight at age 17.      Originally planned to become a teacher before discovering acting.      Started acting in his early twenties, upon joining the Belfast Lyric Players\' theater.      Admitted in 2014 that he had to quit alcohol, after having began to quietly drink heavily following Natasha Richardson\'s death in 2009, and eventually drinking up to two to three bottles of wine per night.      As of 2015, he has appeared in three films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: The Mission (1986), Schindler\'s List (1993) and Gangs of New York (2002). Of those, Schindler\'s List (1993) is the only one to have won the award.      For a couple of years, he was the original choice to play the lead role in Lincoln (2012), which would reunite his partnership with Steven Spielberg after their massive success with Schindler\'s List (1993). However, due to the many delays with the filming, Neeson felt he was too old for the role and he turned down, which went to Daniel Day-Lewis, who won his third Oscar for the role.      He has two roles in common with his The Bounty (1984) co-star Laurence Olivier: (1) Olivier played Zeus in Clash of the Titans (1981) while Neeson played him in the remake Clash of the Titans (2010) and its sequel Wrath of the Titans (2012) and (2) Olivier played General Douglas MacArthur in Inchon (1981) while Neeson played him in In-cheon sang-ryuk jak-jeon (2016).      His character, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, was trained by Count Dooku, who was played by Christopher Lee. Lee ended up passing away on Neeson\'s birthday, June 7.      Was scheduled to produce a television mini series based on the early years of the IRA based on the Leon Uris book Trinity.Personal Quotes (27)      I never did think of myself as handsome--terribly attractive, yes, but not handsome.      I think I realized there were two communities in Northern Ireland when I was about nine or 10, not because there was any trouble but because in certain years my parents would keep us indoors on the 12th of July. I couldn\'t figure that out, because all my mates were out dancing in the streets and I wanted to go out and join them. So it was then that I sensed a ""them and us"" attitude.      No, I don\'t get obsessed with acting. Because in the past when I have got obsessed about it, it really got in the way of the creative process. I\'ve learned to hang the character on the coat-peg at the end of the day, and when I leave in the morning I pick it up again. And I had to work at that because the other way lies a strange sort of madness.      Laid-back? My wife said that? Well, I guess I am. It takes a lot to get me riled.      [on the widespread unemployment of actors and their fear of it] The truth is I love the insecurity part of it, it keeps me on my toes. I think you become bland and predictable without the stress and angst. There\'s a certain lethargy that sets in.      Before Schindler\'s List (1993), I wouldn\'t have believed movies had a lot of power for social change. But having seen what happened with ""Schindler\'s List"", and touring the world with it, it really made me realize the power of images.      Some mornings you wake up and think, ""Gee, I look handsome today."" Other days I think, ""What am I doing in the movies? I wanna go back to Ireland and drive a forklift"".      Acting is invigorating. But I don\'t analyze it too much. It\'s like a dog smelling where it\'s going to do its toilet in the morning.      In Los Angeles, it\'s like they jog for two hours a day and then they think they\'re morally right. That\'s when you want to choke people, you know?      I grew up in Northern Ireland, of course. Lived all through the Troubles; saw violence, the results of violence, at first hand. It\'s always terrified me and fascinated me. So it was a gut reaction, something about how that rage can eat you alive. I can understand that. I haven\'t known it myself, but I knew guys who did. Some of them aren\'t on this planet any more because of it.      (on the state of his family after the death of Natasha Richardson) We\'re doing good. To be honest, we\'re taking each day as it comes.      [on performing with Ralph Fiennes] On Clash of the Titans (2010) we found it hard to act with each other. So I would look at his forehead and he would look at my forehead, because sometimes, if we made eye contact, it got quite silly. We were more restrained on Wrath of the Titans (2012) because we had deeper, darker issues to act.      Even with action films, the fundamental for me is the writing. I adore writers, no matter what the genre is, and if it is a well-written piece of material then I am always very interested.      Just look at the success of Taken (2008), for example. I thought it was going to be a straight-to-video release. That is actually one of the reasons I did it, to be honest. I felt like spending three months in Paris, I\'d get to do all this physical stuff that no one would think of me for, and that the film would go straight to video. Then it became this big success. I was a tiny bit embarrassed by it, a tiny bit, but then people started sending me action scripts.Schindler\'s List (1993) is a very special movie on lots of fronts. It was a brilliant script and it was great to work with Steven Spielberg: I formed a close relationship with him.      [on Darkman (1990)] [The film] has rabid fans, especially in the black community, I\'ve found. It\'s always the black dudes who are stopping me and giving me a high five. I saw Spider-Man (2002), and a lot of it was shot-for-shot Darkman.      [on Schindler\'s List (1993)] I did a lot of research, but I found it was best not to do too much because I was playing a guy who lived in 1942, \'43. If I\'d read all the Holocaust literature, it would have played into my performance. Ignorance was bliss, certainly for Schindler.      [on Nell (1994)] I was a bit disappointed in the film. I felt it should have been rougher and cruder and darker and colder. There was too much of a glow surrounding the movie. I thought Jodie [Foster] was very good, but, I mean, that house she lived in, that was, like, something out of Swiss Family Robinson! There should have been plastic chairs and windows with bits of newspaper stuck in them to stop the draft.      [on working with Julia Roberts in Michael Collins (1996)] I was surprised at first [when she was cast]. I thought, surely there\'s an actress in Ireland who can [play the role]; Neil [Jordan] doesn\'t need this star power. I thought maybe he was going to shoot himself in the foot. But she was very committed to doing it. I thought she was terribly good and I was very proud of her.      [on Gangs of New York (2002)] Martin [Scorsese] was interested in me for the part of Monk, that Brendan Gleeson played. But when I read it, I said, ""No, I want to play this Priest Vallon character. It\'s a showier part."" It was the perfect cameo, I think. You come in, do a bit of physical stuff, and then they talk about you for the rest of the movie. Meanwhile, I\'m back home with my wife and kids, and they\'re still talking about me. It\'s great!      [on losing the role of Lincoln (2012)] I don\'t feel sad about it, and I have no regrets whatsoever. There comes a point where you think ""I\'m past my sell-by date"" and I passed that about three years ago. It\'s just like a light switch went off in my head: it just wasn\'t for me anymore. I\'d lived with it too long and there was a process happening: Steven [Steven Spielberg] would do something else or I would do something else and it was like ""Okay, let\'s cut this loose."" They got one of the best actors to do it, you know, in Daniel Day-Lewis.      [on The A-Team (2010)] I watched it about two months ago and I found it a little confusing and I was in the thing. I just couldn\'t figure out who was who and what\'s been done to him and why, a little bit. I mean, my kids totally understood it and got it. I don\'t know. It\'s a toss of the coin, sometimes, with these things. I thought it was a great ride and Joe [Joe Carnahan] had done a great job. I thought it was cast well. But there you go - you never know.      I am attracted to characters who are loners, who operate by themselves. There\'s something mysterious, manly and stoic about them.      [on director Martin Scorsese] He\'s intimidating. He requires absolute silence on the set - if he hears one tiny sound, it shatters it for him.      Action heroes used to be for much younger men, but now I get all these scripts where it\'s, \'Scratch 35, and now it\'s 60\'!\'      [2014] I\'m keeping myself to myself. And I like it that way. I\'m not hunting. I\'m the opposite of a - what would a male cougar be? Is there such a thing? Whatever it is, I\'m not that.      [on Ralph Fiennes] He\'s one of my closest friends. He\'s very into yoga and I do bits of that with him. We hike and walk and talk a lot.Salary (13)Schindler\'s List\xa0(1993)      $1,500,000       Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace\xa0(1999)      $2,500,000       K-19: The Widowmaker\xa0(2002)      $3,000,000       Gangs of New York\xa0(2002)      $2,000,000       Love Actually\xa0(2003)      $250,000       Batman Begins\xa0(2005)      $2,000,000       Taken\xa0(2008)      $5,000,000       Clash of the Titans\xa0(2010)      $5,000,000       Wrath of the Titans\xa0(2012)      $7,000,000       Battleship\xa0(2012)      $10,000,000       Taken 2\xa0(2012)      $15,000,000       Non-Stop\xa0(2014)      $20,000,000       Taken 3\xa0(2014)      $20,000,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","[u'\nBen Kingsley ', u'""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 54 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(4)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(4)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(28)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(14)  Overview (3)Date of Birth31\xa0December1943,\xa0Scarborough, Yorkshire, England, UK Birth NameKrishna BhanjiHeight5\'\xa08""\xa0(1.73\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Ben Kingsley was born Krishna Bhanji on December 31, 1943 in Scarborough, Yorkshire, England.

Of those, Gandhi (1982) and Schindler\'s List (1993) won in the category.      Kingsley joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1987.      Kingsley considers this an extraordinary coincidence that five days before Sir Richard Attenborough called him for the lead role in Gandhi (1982), he was given a library book on Gandhi.      According to Kingsley, one of his fondest movie memories is watching his father go hysterical while viewing Danny Kaye as a car salesman in Knock on Wood (1954).

Has worked with eight directors who have won a Best Director Oscar: Sir Richard Attenborough, Barry Levinson, Steven Spielberg, Roman Polanski, William Friedkin, Mike Nichols, Martin Scorsese and Robert Zemeckis.Personal Quotes (14)      In an ideal way, in an ideal world, myself and the director are one. And as you rightly say, in an ideal world, you can\'t see the horizon between sky and sea. I felt that the times with Spielberg [Steven Spielberg] on Schindler\'s List (1993), we were moving as one creature.      [on winning the Oscar for Best Actor in Gandhi (1982)] If I knew I was going to win, I would not have gone dressed as a waiter.      As an actor, there\'s no autonomy, unless you\'re prepared to risk the possibility of starving.      Hopefully, as I get older in the business, I make my choices more accurately, and I perhaps know from either the script or the first meeting that it isn\'t going to work.      All the great writers root their characters in true human behavior.      As a singer, I might have fallen among thieves. I wonder if I\'d still be alive by now.      Being a leading man on a film set under the direction of somebody like Dickie Attenborough [Sir Richard Attenborough] is very empowering, and you have to be extremely careful how you use that power.      But comedy I\'d love to do as much as humanly possible.      [on the holocaust] It\'s like a big, hulking monster squatting in the middle of our history and it won\'t go away.      [on actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan] It was a pleasure working with Aishwarya in The Last Legion (2007), and her fans are in for a big surprise. She is an excellent and outstanding actor. She is a shining example of beauty from India, and I\'m sure we will be seeing her in more Hollywood movies real soon. (August 2006)      [on his heritage] I\'m not Jewish... and though there might be some Russian-Jewish heritage way back on my mother\'s side, the thread is so fine there\'s no real evidence.      [on Hailee Steinfeld] She\'s very focused, very mature in her work, and I can see her simply going from strength to strength. She\'s very well-rooted in her craft. There\'s nothing woolly or peripheral about her.      I actually don\'t ever really socialize on the film-set. I\'m hermit-like. I go home, get room service and I work on the lines for tomorrow, because that\'s my job. I can have fun other ways, other times, but for me the joy of acting is to know what I\'m doing and why I\'m doing it.      Glue all of my films together and arrange them in a certain kind of way and you will have the history of 20th and 21st century by SBK [Sir Ben Kingsley].    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","[u'\nRalph Fiennes ', u'""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 78 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(3)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(45)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(25)  Overview (3)Date of Birth22\xa0December1962,\xa0Ipswich, Suffolk, England, UK Birth NameRalph Nathaniel Twisleton-Wykeham-FiennesHeight5\'\xa011""\xa0(1.81\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Actor Ralph Nathaniel Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes was born on December 22, 1962 in Suffolk, England, to Jennifer Anne Mary Alleyne (Lash), a novelist, and Mark Fiennes, a photographer.

For this he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. He did not win, but did win the Best Supporting Actor BAFTA Award for the role, as well as Best Supporting Actor honors from numerous critics groups, including the National Society of Film Critics, and the New York, Chicago, Boston, and London Film Critics associations. His portrayal as G\xf6th also earned him a spot on the American Film Institute\'s list of Top 50 Film Villains. To look suitable to represent Goeth, Fiennes gained weight, but he managed to shed it afterwards. In 1994, he portrayed American academic Charles Van Doren in Quiz Show (1994). In 1996, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Count Alm\xe1sy the World War II epic romance, and another Best Picture winner, Anthony Minghella\'s The English Patient (1996), in which he starred with Kristin Scott Thomas.

Gained several pounds of muscle for his role in Red Dragon (2002).      His performance as Amon Goeth from his film Schindler\'s List (1993) was ranked #15 on the American Film Institute\'s Villains list in their compilation of the 100 years of The Greatest Screen Heroes and Villains.      Is the oldest of 6 children - younger siblings; Martha Fiennes (b. 1964), Magnus Fiennes (b. 1965), Sophie Fiennes (b. 1967) and Jacob Mark Fiennes & Joseph Fiennes (b. 27 May 1970). He also has a foster brother, Michael Emery (b. 31 December 1952) who has been with the family since he was 11.      An Associate Member of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).      He and his The End of the Affair (1999) co-star Julianne Moore have acted in separate Hannibal Lecter films: he in Red Dragon (2002) and she in Hannibal (2001).      His tattoo in Red Dragon (2002) took eight hours to apply.      Has appeared in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) with Gary Oldman. Both of them have played villains in the Hannibal Lecter films: Fiennes played Francis Dolarhyde in Red Dragon (2002), and Oldman played Mason Verger in Hannibal (2001).      4th cousin of Lord Saye & Sele, owner of Broughton Castle, which appears in Shakespeare in Love (1998) as Viola\'s house.      8th cousin of Prince Charles.      Fiennes was reluctant to take the role of Lord Voldemort in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005). In a television interview on AMC\'s Sunday Morning Shootout (2003) (November 20, 2005), he claimed to have been unimpressed with the previous three Harry Potter films. Fiennes was apparently nonplussed at the idea of appearing in the fourth film of a series and stated that he had ""never bought into [the] world"" of Harry Potter. Family members urged him to take the role while other friends counseled against it. He eventually changed his mind after Goblet of Fire director Mike Newell showed Fiennes preproduction conceptions of what the character of Voldemort might look like: ""The little kid in me that likes to dress up and be bad went \'Yeah! I want to do it!\'"".      He was considered for the role of Robert Langdon in The Da Vinci Code (2006), which went to Tom Hanks.      Broke up with Francesca Annis [February 7, 2006].

When he noticed that children watching the filming were scared of him as ""Lord Voldemort"" in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005), he knew he had the character right.      His performance as ""Amon Goeth"" in Schindler\'s List (1993) is ranked #61 on Premiere Magazine\'s 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006).

He has worked with 7 directors who have won a Best Director Oscar: Steven Spielberg, Robert Redford, Kathryn Bigelow, Anthony Minghella, Sam Mendes, and Joel Coen & Ethan Coen.Personal Quotes (25)      It\'s \'Rafe\', actually.      When children were introduced to Lord Voldemort, they looked suitably terrified. Which gave me great gratification.      As an actor, a part of you expects to be looked at. A part of you wants to be looked at. But when I\'m playing a part, in my imagined world, I feel I\'m not me. I may be using bits of me, but I love the sense that I\'m being someone else.      Awards are like applause, and every actor likes to hear applause.      The process of making a film is a mad lottery. Whenever you get the feeling that you\'re making something special, you have to quickly squash it because you are so often proved wrong.      [on The Avengers (1998)] I think it\'s a badge of honor to have a real flop on your resume.      I tried not to play Voldemort over the top, and then I realized there\'s no other way.      I veer away from trying to understand why I act. I just know I need to do it.      The people I consider successful are so because of how they handle their responsibilities to other people, how they approach the future, people who have a full sense of the value of their life and what they want to do with it. I call people successful not because they have money or their business is doing well but because, as human beings, they have a fully developed sense of being alive and engaged in a lifetime task of collaboration with other human beings -- their mothers and fathers, their family, their friends, their loved ones, the friends who are dying, the friends who are being born.Success.. is all about being able to extend love to people... not in a big, capital letter sense but in the everyday. Little by little, task by task, gesture by gesture, word by word.      [on the death of Natasha Richardson] I cannot imagine a world without her wit, her love, her mischief, her great, great talent and her gift for living. I loved her very much. She was a supreme friend. I shall miss her deeply.      [on filming Coriolanus (2011) in Belgrade, Serbia] I needed an important and big capital city and I didn\'t want it to be Rome, but any contemporary city. Given this is a modern interpretation of Shakespeare, Rome just wasn\'t the suitable location because Rome of today is reminiscent of a mighty state like the USA or Russia, and I wanted it to be something different. I\'ve come to realize here in Belgrade that a lot of history is reflected through buildings. This is a capital city with a great history. I have been to Bucharest and Zagreb, but Belgrade has always been the first choice for me. Initially, I was attracted by Belgrade\'s spirit and later I realized this was an ideal filming location.      [on filming Coriolanus (2011) in Belgrade, Serbia] I am lucky to have a great crew from Serbia and the UK, and I\'ve been working on the script with John Logan for almost three and a half years.      [on filming Coriolanus (2011) in Belgrade, Serbia] You really do have fantastic actors here in Serbia as well as a long theatre tradition, which is probably why it\'s now even stronger than that of London and I\'m really flattered to be filming here.      My parents were very financially-challenged. All of us children have the memory of being told that there was no money, we have to sell this, there\'s no presents for Christmas. Of being in the front line of that constant worry; the atmosphere in the home always charged with anxiety. \'What do we do? What do we do?\'      [on directing himself in The Invisible Woman (2013)] I\'ve loved being able to be, as it were, the puppet master of my own performance. I love that. But you need people to give you good, constructive, critical feedback. It\'s crazy. It\'s very, very hard. I don\'t know how people do it consistently and do it well - like Orson Welles did, or Laurence Olivier did, Clint Eastwood does. Kevin Costner\'s done it. There\'s no question that you\'ve got two often opposing headspaces which you have to balance.      [on doing full frontal nudity in A Bigger Splash (2015)] I liked [the nudity] because it was in the service of illustrating extreme spontaneity in Harry\'s character. All my nude scenes are extremely spontaneous and appropriate for the situations in which my character is. My nudity is a function of the film\'s plot. I knew I\'d run around naked, so I had to physically prepare, to tighten the muscles.      [on A Bigger Splash (2015)] I\'d never been asked to play a guy who dances and gets naked and sings karaoke! I don\'t believe I ever played a part like Harry... It was a very special kind of film.      When you meet women, don\'t pretend to be anything that you\'re not.      I reject the notion that there\'s a moral entity out there running the universe and judging us. I think there\'s energy, which is frightening and unpredictable. We\'ll never fully understand it - we\'re at the mercy of it - and whatever that thing is, that might be God.      My mother wrote six novels and then another book about a trip to pilgrimage centres in France. She also painted. She was her own thinker; highly individual in the way she approached just who you are. For instance, I was at grammar school and there\'s a reasonable pressure to get good exam results and maybe go to university. My mother would say, ""If that\'s what you want then go for it but don\'t feel that the system in place is the one that you have to adhere to. Be true to yourself, follow your path and give yourself 100 per cent. Don\'t dabble.""      I have huge anxiety attacks. I\'ll wake up early in the morning with my brain anxious about something and I don\'t even know what it is, just a general sense of profound uncertainty. It\'s from the unconscious, I suppose, fears about existence. A weird twilight panic. We feel we can organise our lives and have an order that we can control but really we can\'t; it\'s always paper-thin and underneath there\'s this lurking chaos. You think, ""Fuck! This could come at me at any moment.""      I used to smoke socially and bum cigarettes off people at parties; the number of packets I\'ve bought in my life I could count on both hands. Have I smoked marijuana? Yes. I think most people have had a drag on a joint.      Once in a while I like to watch some silly comedy, usually on airplanes. That movie with Mark Wahlberg and the bear was just excellent. Ted! I\'d love to do something like that.      Vodka martinis are better stirred, not shaken.

His story was brought to international acclaim by the 1982 novel Schindler\'s Ark and the 1993 film, Schindler\'s List.An ethnic German, Schindler was born April 28, 1908, in Zwittau, Austria-Hungary, what is now Moravia in the Czech Republic. Schindler grew up with all the privileges money could buy. He was born Catholic, but from an early age he inhabited a world of sin. His exploits with women are the stuff of barroom legend.He married Emilie Schindler at nineteen, but was never without a mistress or two. Hard drinking and feckless, he had the soul of a gambler, winning big and losing bigger. He had presided over the demise of his family business and become a salesman when opportunity came knocking in the guise of the war.Never one to miss a chance to make money, he marched into Poland on the heels of the SS. He dived headfirst into the black-market and the underworld and soon made friends with the local Gestapo bigwigs, softening them up with women, money and illicit booze. His newfound connections helped him acquire a factory which he ran with the cheapest labor around: Jewish.Schindler (center) with German army officers.At first he seemed like every other usurping German industrialist, driven by profit and unmoved by the means of his profiteering. But somewhere along the line, something changed.In December 1939, as occupied Poland was being torn apart by the savagery of the Holocaust, Schindler took his first faltering steps from the darkness of Nazism towards the light of heroism. If you saw a dog going to be crushed under a car, he said later of his wartime actions, wouldn\'t you help him?Before the outbreak of war, Poland had been a relative haven for European Jews - Krakow\'s Jewish population numbered over 50,000. But when Germany invaded, destruction began immediately and it was merciless. Jews were herded into crowded ghettos, randomly beaten and humiliated, capriciously killed. Jewish property and businesses were summarily destroyed, or appropriated by the SS and \'sold\' to Nazi \'investors\', one of whom was the fast talking, womanizing, money hungry Schindler.Not long after acquiring his Emalia factory - which produced enamel goods and munitions to supply the German front - the removal of Jews to death camps began in earnest. Schindler\'s Jewish accountant put him in touch with the few Jews with any remaining wealth. They invested in his factory, and in return they would be able to work there and perhaps be spared. He was persuaded to hire more Jewish workers, designating their skills as essential, paying off the Nazis so they would allow them to stay in Krakow. Schindler was making money, but everyone in his factory was fed, no-one was beaten, no-one was killed. It became an oasis of humanity in a desert of moral torpor.Schindler with a group of Schindlerjuden.As the brutality of the Holocaust escalated, Schindler\'s protection of his Jewish workers became increasingly active. In the summer of 1942, he witnessed a German raid on the Jewish ghetto. Watching innocent people being packed onto trains bound for certain death, something awakened in him.Beyond this day, no thinking person could fail to see what would happen, he said later. I was now resolved to do everything in my power to defeat the system.By the autumn of 1944, Germany\'s hold on Poland had weakened. As the Russian army approached, the Nazi\'s tried desperately to complete their program of liquidation and sent all remaining Jews to die. But Schindler remained true to the Schindlerjuden, the workers he referred to as my children.After the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto and the transfer of many Jews to the Plaszow concentration camp, Schindler used his influence to set up a branch of the camp for 900 Jewish workers in his factory compound in Zablocie and made his now famous list of the workers he would need for its operation.The factory operated in its new location a year, making defective bullets for German guns. Conditions were grim, for the Schindlers as well as the workers. But Schindler saved most of these workers when he transferred his factory to Brunnlitz (Sudetenland) in October 1944.Office workers from the Emalia factory.When the war ended, Schindler fled to Argentina with his wife and a handful of his workers and bought a farm. In 1958, he abandoned his land, his wife and his mistress to return to Germany. He spent the remaining years of his life dividing his time between Germany and Israel, where he was honored and taken care of by his Schindlerjuden.He died in Hildesheim in 1974. His extraordinary story might have died with him but for their gratitude.In trying to answer the inevitable question, why did he do it, one of the survivors said: I don\'t know what his motives were... But I don\'t give a damn. What\'s important is that he saved our lives.He negotiated the salvation of his 1,300 Jews by operating right at the heart of the system using all the tools of the devil - bribery, black marketeering and lies.Perhaps the question is not why he did it, but rather how could he not. And perhaps the answer is unimportant. It is his actions that matter now, testimony that even in the worst of circumstances, the most ordinary of us can act courageously. If Oskar Schindler, flawed as he was, did it, then so might we, and that is reason enough to hope.""']","[u'Itzhak Stern', u'""""']","[u'Amon Goeth', u'""Played by Ralph Fiennes, Amon Goeth was an Austrian SS-Hauptsturmf\xfchrer (captain) and the commandant of the Krak\xf3w-Pasz\xf3w concentration camp in Pasz\xf3w in German-occupied Poland for most of the camp\'s existence during World War II.""']","[u'Emilie Schindler', u'""""']","[[<bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nI know many of you, out there will disagree with me, when I say that \r\nSchindler's List is one of the greatest film that there has ever been. \r\nIt does sound that I'm extremely overrating it, but I truly believe \r\nthat Schindler's List is up there with The Godfather and Citizen Kane I \r\nmean everything about is so good, that its close to perfection.\r\n\r\nThe acting is brilliant, every actor does an amazing job.

So in a great opening parallel\nmontage, Spielberg depicts the personal journey of one man and the\nmassive journey of one race...<br><br>As thousand of families are forced to abandon their careers, properties\nand homes to live in overcrowded ghettos, the scene switches to\nSchindler, where he pays his way to get a fine table at a fancy\nnightclub in Nazi-occupied city of Krakow, the surviving gem of\nPoland's medieval cities...<br><br>Drinking alone, he scans the strange clientele and slowly sets about\ncasting his nets on the SS German officers... He quickly plied them\nwith food, caviar and French wine... And as a magician, overcoming\nevery resistance, he transforms the separate tables of the cabaret into\none joyful drunken party of wine, women, and song for the Nazi\nofficials...<br><br>The two worlds come together when Schindler meets Itzhak Stern and\noffers him a deal... Since Jews cannot own businesses, they should work\ntogether... Stern's contacts can provide investors, and Stern's\nexpertise can run the business, and Schindler will take care of the\npresentation...<br><br>In those same scenes, Amon Goeth is introduced...<br><br>Goeth is a flabby psychopath who comes to embody the evils of Nazi\nracism... He is in charge of the camp where the workers are housed and\nmust be bribed and pampered if Schindler is to stay in business...\nGoeth's excessive cruelty is also part of the reason that Schindler is\ntransformed from an opportunistic 'victimizer' to 'humanitarian.' <br><br>Liam Neeson portrays Oskar Schindler, the businessman with irresistible\ncharm - the charm of the same magnitude that saved hundreds of innocent\npeople and brightened Schindler's reputation among critical\nhistorians... As movie gradually progresses, Schindler's perspective\nchanges much as when he himself states that ""People die - it's a fact\nof life.""<br><br>Neeson's flexibility as an actor is impressive... His performance is\nbuilt on a combination of self-confidence, indecision, and doubt... His\ncharacter is always evolving, yet always convincing... His\ntransformation from 'war profiteer' to a ""righteous"" man is adequately\nslow and well developed... As the war draws to a close, Schindler\ndecides unexpectedly to evaluate his life... He turns over his gains\ninto a noble cause - and virtually takes his workers away from being\nswallowed up by the Holocaust... In one of the film's most touching\nscenes, Schindler goes to Auschwitz and fights for the freedom of the\nwives and children of his workers...<br><br>Ben Kingsley plays the role of Itzhak Stern, the timid gifted\naccountant, and the silent partner wary of his employer and the\nenemy... Stern (spared from the horrors of the holocaust) is also\nSchindler's good angel... He occasionally reminds the audacious man\nthat he could get in a lot of trouble if his true motives are ever\ndiscovered... Kingley delivers history's judgment of Oskar Schindler in\na touching moment: 'Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.'<br><br>Ralph Fiennes brilliantly portrays Amon Goethe, the complex study of a\nsadistic true monster... He is a heartless and cruel killer, with a\ncomplicated, twisted personality... Stripped to the waist and\noverlooking the prison yard, he leaves his mistress Ingrid (Beatrice\nMacola) in bed to shoot arbitrarily, with his scope rifle, slow-moving\nJews from the veranda of his high villa...<br><br>Goeth despises Jews, yet he inexplicably falls in love with a shy\nJewish maid, Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz). Rather than allowing\nhimself to touch her, and nearly committing the capital crime of\nkissing her, he remembers that he is supposed to hate her, and beats\nher ruthlessly for seducing him...<br><br>Goeth is a man to despise... But the full scope of his atrocities are\nnot entirely shown... Spielberg shows carefully as much of the horror\nas the screen can bear...<br><br>The savage scenes are difficult to watch... Spielberg's camera pans to\nthe pillar of dark smoke rising from the chimney stack into the\nfrightening sky of Auschwitz, and to the lines of Jews unknowingly lead\ntoward the gas chambers...<br><br>Spielberg captures the terror of the Nazi reign in the terrifying\ndramatic moments when stunned women and children are mistakenly sent to\nAuschwitz... The disturbing images of arbitrary murder are harshly\nrealistic...<br><br>'Schindler's List' assaults the viewer with lasting images of Jewish\nprisoners announcing their names as they are registered, given work\nassignments, or separated into ""essential"" and ""non-essential.""<br><br>Spielberg focuses on children and uses them both as victimizers and\nvictims... In a powerful way to personalize the slaughter without a\nsingle word, Spielberg colors the coat of a little girl as she is\ninvisibly making her way, aimless and alone, through the chaotic\ndestruction of the Krakow ghetto... (It's almost the same shade as the\njacket worn by the young protagonist of Spielberg's 'Empire of the\nSun', in a similar situation when he's alone in a mob and trying to\nfind his way home).<br><br>'Schindler's List' is a tribute to those who lost their lives in the\nHolocaust, a dramatic recreation of that dark, frightening period\nduring World War II... The horror is alleviated, slightly, by Janusz\nKaminski's stunning Black and White cinematography... The lack of color\nreminds us of German Expressionist films, and allows Spielberg to be\nexplicit without becoming tastelessly graphic... John Williams' tragic\nand somber, almost unnoticed score adds to the melancholy tone...<br><br>Spielberg's great visual moments - when, in a scene, Schindler joins\nthe Nazis on the platform as they fire the cold water at the cars on\nthe desperate, suffocating people inside... <br><br>'Schindler's List' is an outstanding movie... It has an important role\nin adding credibility to the Holocaust, and in Thomas Keneally's\nfact-based novel, Spielberg finds the right balance of redemption and\nsorrow..

We see him, at the beginning, laying out\nhis arsenal of control. Clothes, money, all his weapons to control the\nNazis are to forward himself into wealth and women. He strategically\nuses the waiter and his gifts to ingratiate the Nazis for the factory\nhe plans to open. He tries the same technique on Stern and it doesn't\nwork quite so well. Oskar tries to hide from the horrors that surround\nhim. He chastises Stern for the effusive thanks the one armed worker\ngives him, before he is later shot. The film is so long, I would like\nto point out some of the most powerful images. I love the Jungian\nDuality scene, the monster who just stepped on a man and shot him in\nthe head, pauses to baby talk and play with a little Jewish boy. Here,\nin brilliant fashion, you see the two sided Janus faces of human\nnature. I love when Amon simply gets up, stretches, and begins randomly\nshooting Jews in the camp. What a brilliant depiction of how routinized\nthe barbarism was; to Amon, it was no more immoral that flushing the\ntoilet or walking about, he had killed so many.<br><br>The pettiness and envy, where the Jewish woman architect shows up his\nretarded fatheads, he needs to shoot her immediately,""Oh, an educated\nJew, like Karl Marx himself, shoot her."" I love when Oskar tries to\nsave Jews by convincing Amon that pardoning is more powerful than\nkilling."" He tries it for a bit, but the core of his cruelty is not\nracial; he just is so jealous and hateful that his predilections\novercome him."" Watch him try it out, he just cannot help himself, he\nloves killing people.

Between 1938 and 1945, the Jewish\npopulation was segregated and persecuted, culminating in the merciless\nslaughter of approximately six million Jews (this figure is quoted in\nthe film, though most historical estimates vary between five and seven\nmillion). Amidst all this butchery, one man decided to make a\ndifference, famously saving the lives of more than 1100 Jews- men,\nwomen and children who would otherwise have been killed.<br><br>Oskar Schindler (played brilliantly by Liam Neeson, ""Batman Begins"")\nwas a Sudeten German industrialist, a wealthy womanizer who wasn't\nafraid to throw his money around. Always bearing his Nazi Party badge\nproudly, Schindler would often frequent nightclubs, extravagantly\nshowering high-ranked Nazi officers and their girlfriends with\nchampagne and caviar. With impeccable connections in the black-market,\nthere was little that he couldn't get his hands on, and he was a good\nperson to know. Buying friends was something that Schindler could do\nwell, and he would often use these newfound alliances to aid his own\nbusiness ventures. When thousands of the Polish Jew population was\nrelegated to the Krak\xf3w Ghetto in 1941, Schindler saw an opportunity\nfor further success, enlisting desperate Jewish investors and employing\nJewish workers (who were substantially cheaper to employ) to open an\nenamelware factory. His connections in high places ensured lucrative\narmy contracts, and Schindler need only have watched as his personal\nfortune grew, despite doing little to run the company beyond offering\nit ""a certain panache.""<br><br>It is clear from the beginning that Oskar Schindler does not harbour\nany racial prejudices. When Schindler requests the services of Itzhak\nStern (a superb Ben Kingsley, ""Gandhi""), a clever, humanitarian Jewish\naccountant, Stern declares that, ""By law I have to tell you, sir, I'm a\nJew."" ""Well, I'm a German, so there we are,"" replies Schindler\nindifferently, before getting straight to business. It is not race that\nhe is concerned with, it is himself\x85 and, of course, his money. Stern\ndoes not enjoy running Schindler's business, and he initially acquires\nlittle satisfaction from it. When Schindler attempts to convey his\ngenuine gratitude for his profitable services with a glass of whiskey,\nStern absentmindedly refuses to drink it, and an embittered Schindler\ndrinks it himself before ordering Stern to leave.<br><br>With the arrival of Amon Goeth (played as the epitome of evil by Ralph\nFiennes, ""Red Dragon""), a Hauptsturmf\xfchrer of the SS, the hopeless\nplight of the Jews grows darker. In a harrowing extended sequence,\nlargely based on the testimonies of Holocaust survivors, the Jews are\nmercilessly ""liquidated"" from the Krakow Ghetto, many simply shot on\nthe spot. ""Today is history,"" proclaims Goeth. ""Today will be\nremembered. Years from now the young will ask with wonder about this\nday. Today is history and you are part of it\x85. For six centuries there\nhas been a Jewish Krakow. By this evening those six centuries will be a\nrumor. They never happened. Today is history.""<br><br>This sequence also marks the celebrated appearance of the little girl\nin the red coat. An ingenious plot device, the character was based upon\na real girl named Roma Ligocka who, unlike her film counterpart,\nsurvived the war, and wrote a memoir entitled ""The Girl in the Red\nCoat: A Memoir"". The embodiment of innocence, Schindler spots the small\ngirl wandering amongst the black-and-white chaos of the Krakow Ghetto,\nand we follow her as she retreats into a building and takes shelter\nunder a bed. When Schindler later notices her disheveled corpse carted\npast him to be incinerated, he is understandably horrified, unable to\nunderstand how the soldiers could possibly destroy something so\ninnocent. This event memorably signifies the turning-point of\nSchindler's attitudes towards the carnage, fuelling his desire to save\nas many Jews as possible.<br><br>Long known as a ""blockbuster"" filmmaker \x96 with such adventure classics\nas ""Jaws,"" ""E.T. The Extra Terrestrial"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""\nto his name - ""Schindler's List"" was - and remains - Steven Spielberg's\nmost mature directorial effort. Working with a screenplay that Steven\nZaillian adapted from Thomas Keneally's Booker Prize-winning\n'Schindler's Ark,' Spielberg treats the subject matter with the respect\nit deserves. Wisely choosing to depict the events as realistically as\npossible, Spielberg allows the images to speak for themselves. Flawless\nacting, stunning cinematography and a haunting John Williams score\nexcel this film above all others of the 1990s. This is the powerful\nstory of the difference that just one man can make, and it is a story\nthat deserves to be seen by all. We can only feel grateful that it was\nSteven Spielberg who chose to be at the helm.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nOne of the best movies in history, Schindler's List is a movie about\nhumanity , sympathy , what the war bring to us , how shame to kill\nsomeone because of his religion is ...<br><br>This movie is Complete! there is no wrong with it Directing was awesome\n, Cinematography &amp; Photography are perfect!<br><br>Acting was amazing , especially from Ben Kingsley which i really was\nshocked why the Academy didn't nominate him for Oscar ! <br><br>Anyway , this movie has a very very strong message ; that WHOEVER SAVES\nONE LIFE SAVES THE WORLD ENTIRE , by this legendary quote u can realize\nhow strong was this movie ..<br><br>And yes I said i'm Muslim and give it 10/10 because i think there are\nJews or others think that we R the Muslims will hate the movie before\nwe watch it !! no that's wrong! the movie is perfect , it's about\nRisking your life to save the ones around you. it's about SACRIFICE why\ndon't we love it ! plz guys kill this wrong idea in ur head !<br><br>FROM AN ANSWER FROM YAHOO I QUOTE : "" the final scene when he looks at\nthe car and says that the money spent on the car could have saved a\ndozen more and then looks at the watch and says that watch could have\nsaved one more. he starts to cry.

Spielberg made it as a personal film for\nhimself and other Jews affected by the Holocaust. There is nothing\nflashy about the film except for Neeson's bravura performance.\nSpielberg's usual style is invisible, and the cinematography and\nediting, although excellent, are not shown off to make a spectacle of\nthe film or give it an epic feel. Yet it is still a compulsive,\ninvolving, and utterly heart-wrenchingly moving filming of a part of\nhistory that should not be forgotten. The screenplay is one of the best\never written: it captures the stories of so many Holocaust survivors\nbut without distracting from the main story at hand. The black and\nwhite photography and editing is perfect, and John Williams provides a\nperfectly subtle but nice music score. The acting is simply brilliant,\nwith Liam Neeson towering as Oskar Schindler, and Ralph Fiennes\nbringing out the Nazi character Amon Goeth into full flesh. And Ben\nKingsley and Embeth Davidtz give off excellent performances too. The\nfilm also has a lot to say about absolute power corrupting and\nspiraling out of control, and such a message of the film can be applied\nto any time and crisis, not just the Holocaust. This is not just one of\nthe the ten best films ever produced, but it shall remain so for years\nto come, because its messages in terms of power and racism are\napplicable in any age.\n</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\n"" I....pardon you.""<br><br>These words spoken by Amon Goethe (Ralph Fiennes) during the film can be\naptly used to signify the themes of this film: power and\nforgiveness.<br><br>I am part of the post war generation who has been lucky enough not to\nexperience any major war.

Any other person would\nnot\nhave done it justice.<br><br>The film focuses on how a German named Oskar Schindler saved the lives of\nthousands of Jews by employing them to work in his factory during WWII.\nHowever, I feel the film's primary aim is not to show us Schindler's\nkindness but the horrors of war. There are some of the most true and\ngraphic\nscenes here ever captured on celluloid. People being shot for no particular\nreason, hiding in fear, stripped and gased, abused......so much so that\nviewers watching it for the 1st time will be deeply affected. We have never\ngot to see this ""flip side"" of the war in many Hollywood productions which\nonly focuses on action and their unrealistic ""gung-ho"" heroes.

Superior\ncinematography, lots of historical references (which, although not\nalways completely accurate, give a good sense of what the holocaust was\nlike for the Jews), brilliant actors, brilliant score, amazing\nscreenplay.<br><br>People have criticized it for being too sentimental, and I can\nunderstand their problems with that, but I can't agree with them. The\nsubject matter is still one of the darkest periods in living history.<br><br>Now we have a film like ""Der Untergang"" which shows the story from\ninside the Nazi high command at the end of the war, and that movie is\neven more haunting than this one. It doesn't focus however on the\nvictimization of the entire Jewish community, and therefore does not\nhave to deal with the emotional burdens of the people who had to live\nthrough these conditions.<br><br>Another point is that if you want to show the holocaust in a drama\nfilm, you have to think of your audience as well. Although many people\nstill know what it was like, there are also large groups of people who\nhaven't got a clue about the war. They heard the figure, 6 million Jews\nkilled in concentration camps, but know nothing about the ghettos, the\nslave labour, the slow descent from being deprived of the right to have\ncertain jobs, to being murdered just because you are a Jew.<br><br>Schindler's list makes this history accessible to the masses. Spielberg\ndoes this expertly, by balancing the sentimental with the downright\ncynical and horrific.<br><br>Where a film like Der Untergang focuses more on the human weaknesses of\nthe Nazis, this film poses the Nazis outright as the pure evil that\nJews had to deal with in the war. This is a very different approach,\nthat can be classed as a more conventional narrative. Good versus Evil.\nOskar Schindler stands alone as the ""good German"". In reality there\nwere others like him of course, but in the reality the protagonists of\nthis movie faced, those ""others"" played no part, so it is not necessary\nfor the movie to work to emphasize this.<br><br>What more can be said? Well a criticism has also been that the Jews are\nbeing portrayed as little more than meek victims, and that no heroism\nfrom them is shown. Unfortunately the war didn't offer many heroic\nopportunities for the Jewish people. There are exceptions to this rule,\nbut most of them suffered without hope, without a chance to fight back.\nYou can look for the exceptions, and criticize Spielberg for not\nshowing that side. Would that be fair on history? Maybe, but let's face\nit, the exceptions were far and few between, through no fault of the\nJews themselves, but because the Nazis had such a firm grip on the\nThird Reich that a deed of defiance by one hero, could cost the lives\nof many bystanders who had nothing to do with it. Most Jews simply had\nto bear every degrading action undertaken against them, and there was\nnothing they could do about it. <br><br>All in all you have to be quite cynical not to be impressed by this\nmovie. It is just too powerful for that. Yes, in the end much is made\nof making Schindler into a true hero, especially the scene before he\nflees, where he cries that he could have saved more. Some people hate\nthis scene, and think it schmaltzy, over-sentimental, sanctimoneous\ncrap. I think that it is a great scene, although this scene is very\nHollywood, and most probably not an accurate portrayal of the way\nSchindler fled the factory. But it ends the development of his\ncharacter, as he finally realises the mistakes he made. He therefore\ngoes from being a cynical crook at the start of the movie, to a man who\nreluctantly saved people, to a man who enjoys his role as saviour, to\nfinally coming to terms with what he did, and what more he could have\ndone, if he hadn't been busy showing off.<br><br>This movie is a true classic. If you can watch it without shedding a\ntear, please check your heart's temperature, because it probably is\nfrozen solid.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nSchindler's List \x96 CATCH IT (A+) Schindler's List is a 1993 film about\nOskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than\na thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by\nemploying them in his factories.

His mother, Ann, was a teacher and landscape painter. His father, Ernie, was a journalist who had changed the family name from ""Smith"" to ""Roth""; Ernie was born in Brooklyn, New York, to an immigrant family of Irish ancestry.Tim grew up in Dulwich, a middle-class area in the south of London. He demonstrated his talent for picking up accents at an early age when he attended school in Brixton, where he faced persecution from classmates for his comfortable background and quickly perfected a cockney accent to blend in. He attended Camberwell Art College and studied sculpture before he dropped out and pursued acting.The blonde actor\'s first big break was the British TV movie Made in Britain (1982). Roth made a huge splash in that film as a young skinhead named Trevor. He next worked with director Mike Leigh on Meantime (1984), which he has counted among his favorite projects. He debuted on the big screen when he filled in for Joe Strummer in the Stephen Frears neo-noir The Hit (1984). Roth gained more attention for his turn as Vincent Van Gogh in Vincent & Theo (1990) and his work opposite Gary Oldman in Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead (1990).He moved to Los Angeles in search of work and caught the eye of young director Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino had envisioned Roth as a possible Mr. Blonde or Mr. Pink in his heist flick Reservoir Dogs (1992), but Roth campaigned for the role of Mr. Orange instead, and ultimately won the part. It proved to be a huge breakthrough for Roth, as audiences found it difficult to forget his performance as a member of a group of jewelry store robbers who is slowly bleeding to death. Tarantino cast Roth again in the landmark film Pulp Fiction (1994). Roth and actress Amanda Plummer played a pair of robbers who hold up a restaurant. 1995 saw the third of Roth\'s collaborations with Tarantino, a surprisingly slapstick performance in the anthology film Four Rooms (1995). That same year Roth picked up an Academy Award nomination for his campy turn as a villain in the period piece Rob Roy (1995).Continuing to take on disparate roles, Roth did his own singing (with an American accent to boot) in the lightweight Woody Allen musical Everyone Says I Love You (1996). He starred opposite Tupac Shakur in Shakur\'s last film, the twisted comedy Gridlock\'d (1997). The pair received positive critical notices for their comic chemistry. Standing in contrast to the criminals and baddies that crowd his CV, Roth\'s work as the innocent, seafaring pianist in the Giuseppe Tornatore film La leggenda del pianista sull\'oceano (1998) became something of a fan favorite. Grittier fare followed when Roth made his directorial debut with The War Zone (1999), a frank, critically acclaimed drama about a family torn apart by incest. He made his next high-profile appearance as an actor as General Thade, an evil simian in the Tim Burton remake of Planet of the Apes (2001). Roth was, of course, all but unrecognizable in his primate make-up.Roth has continued to enjoy a mix of art house and mainstream work, including everything from the lead role in Francis Ford Coppola\'s esoteric Youth Without Youth (2007) to becoming ""The Abomination"" in the special effects-heavy blockbuster The Incredible Hulk (2008). Roth took his first major American television role when he signed on to the Fox-TV series Lie to Me (2009)- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Azure_Girl          Spouse (1)               Nikki Butler          (25 January\xa01993            - present)\xa0(2 children)          Trade Mark (7)        Often works with European and American auteur directors.

He bears tattoos on his right arm for significant events in his life. He has 8 such tattoos, as of 2010.      Even with his reputation as an actor firmly established, Tim Roth still tends bar from time to time.      He has a son named Jack (b. 1983), with Lori Baker.      Two sons, with Butler, Timothy (b. 1995) and Cormac (b. 1996)      One of the first actor/models to get the trendy ""thorny tribal"" tattoo around his arm.      His middle name is Simon.      His father was born in Brooklyn, New York City, to a British immigrant family of Irish ancestry. His mother was English. Tim\'s father changed the family name from the British/American sounding ""Smith"" to ""Roth"" after World War II, because he was a journalist who traveled in countries that disliked the British and Americans.      Was considered for the role of Severus Snape in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone (2001), but dropped out to star in Tim Burton\'s remake of Planet of the Apes (1968). The role was then given to Alan Rickman.      Turned down the role of Johnny Rotten in Sid and Nancy (1986), because he felt the film depicted history that was ""too recent.""      Was considered as a replacement for Anthony Hopkins, when Hopkins was reluctant to return to play Hannibal Lector in Hannibal (2001). However, in the end, Hopkins accepted the role.

Has no formal acting training.      Developed his trademark Cockney accent when in school to fit in with classmates and avoid being bullied.      Bears a strong physical resemblance to stunt actor and martial artist Ray Park.      Accepted the villain role in The Incredible Hulk (2008) to please his sons.      He was considered for Mark Wahlberg\'s role in The Yards (2000).      He apologised for United Passions (2014) and admitted that he did it for the money.      He turned down the role of Jack Scagnetti in Natural Born Killers (1994).      He turned down the roles of Seth Gecko and Pete Bottoms in From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) due to a scheduling conflict.      Roth is a survivor of child sexual abuse committed by his paternal grandfather, who he has stated sexually abused him from childhood until his early teen years. He first revealed that he was a survivor of sexual abuse during press for his directorial debut, The War Zone (1999) (which dealt with the topics of incest and sexual violence within a family), but declined to name the perpetrator at that time. In December of 2016, he gave an interview to the British newspaper The Guardian in which he revealed that his abuser was his grandfather, who had also sexually abused Roth\'s own father when he was a child.      He was considered for the role of Dr. Frederick Chilton in Red Dragon (2002).      Politically, Roth is a supporter of the Green Party of England and Wales.      He was offered the lead role in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994).      He was in the running to play the young Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999).      He was an early candidate to play Arthur Dent in a film version of ""The Hitch-Hiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy"" during the 1980s.      He was considered for the role of Amon Goeth in Schindler\'s List (1993).      He was considered for the role of Lt. Archie Hilcox in Inglourious Basterds (2009).Personal Quotes (29)      I have a bad time between jobs because I\'m always convinced I\'ll never work again. I think it may be an English thing, this fear of unemployment.      [on attending the Academy Awards ceremony] Like going to Liberace\'s house on acid.      [on Reservoir Dogs (1992)] There\'s a lot of blood in that film. I think there\'s only nine pints in a body; we had about four gallons.      [on Gridlock\'d (1997) co-star Tupac Shakur] I found him to be incredibly talented. I used to call him ""New Money"" because he had a massive Bentley and a different model sat in the car each day, and he used to call me ""Free Shit"" because I always used to get loads of free stuff from companies. It\'s a shame what happened - I think he could have gone on to be quite something as an actor.      I\'ve never really played a goody in the traditional sense. Anyway, I don\'t think that I look the part of a heroic character, especially not in Hollywood, so they never really come up. On a childish level, villains are just more fun.      I remember watching The Sex Pistols on TV when I came home from school - I think it was Johnny Rotten and Siouxsie Sioux from the Banshees - and they started swearing and the guy interviewing them got fired for provoking them. It was a wonderful time. It was like saying, \'Ugly is beautiful, everything you\'re taught us is wrong.\'      Every film you make as an actor, it\'s not yours, it\'s the director\'s.      I\'m not a method actor. I don\'t really have to go live in a hut in the tundra to play an accountant. People tell you that\'s what you should do because it\'s what De Niro does. It never worked for me. I\'ve always been able to learn what I need to learn from the script.      There\'s stuff I\'m really scared of doing that I think I *should* do. I *should* do some Shakespeare but it terrifies me. I want to... Harold Pinter adapted King Lear for me - into a film - and I want to try and make that at some point, but, you know, it\'s damned hard finding money for Shakespeare if you\'re not Kenneth Branagh, you know?      [on how his relationship with Quentin Tarantino came to be] Well, he came to me. He\'d seen Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead (1990) and Vincent & Theo (1990), which are films he really liked. My agent sent me the script, and wrote a little note saying I should look at the role of Pink or Blonde. And I read it and I said ""No, I like that guy Orange, because he\'s a liar. I\'ll be an Englishman playing an American playing a cop who\'s playing a villain."" And I liked that combination, because it seemed incredibly difficult to do. So then I met with Quentin and we got along very well, but they wanted me to read, and I wouldn\'t do it. I don\'t like auditioning in that way, because I\'m not very good at it. But we all got drunk, and eventually I did. We became very fast friends. We worked very hard and very closely together, and then he wrote Honey Bunny and Pumpkin for me and Amanda [Amanda Plummer] to do together in [Pulp Fiction (1994)]. And then Four Rooms (1995) came about because Steve Buscemi couldn\'t do it, I think. They came to me and asked, ""Would you fancy having a crack at this guy?"" And I thought, ""Yeah, I\'ll have a go, wild."" And from there we did talk for a long time about Inglourious Basterds (2009), but with the TV show, the schedule just got in the way in the end, so I couldn\'t do it. I was ready, though, to go out to Germany with him. Working with Quentin, you just hit the ground running. It\'s a hell of a ride, but it\'s always phenomenal. Really, I owe him, because I suppose he\'s the guy who got me noticed in the States, which is where I\'ve been living now for the best part of 20 years.      [on making Youth Without Youth (2007)] All in all, it was an extraordinary journey. It was 90 days, I think, pretty much in Romania. I think I had one day off. And I think I made sure I switched my phone off so no one could get to me. It was very, very difficult, but incredibly worthwhile. We made it for a very small amount of money. It was a very low-budget movie.Funny Games (2007) was one of the toughest things I\'ve ever done, on many levels. Firstly, the director [Michael Haneke], I thought was wonderful. He\'s a fantastic man. But we were remaking a film that had already been done, and he wanted to remake it shot-for-shot. There was no real room for maneuvering, and for playing with or experimenting with the character. You pretty much had to be where the other actor sat or stood and not play around with the lines at all. That was part of this weird experiment he was doing. And it was shot in sequence. So you started in the morning distressed, and you ended your day even more distressed, and then you got up in the morning and you started more distressed and you ended up even more distressed, on-and-on for five and a half weeks. It was absolutely brutal, but it was a hell of a journey.      [on what drew him to Lie to Me (2009)] It\'s like an experiment for me. I\'ve done telly before. I\'ve done films for TV, and miniseries. But I\'ve never done anything like this. When they first came to me, I thought the character was really interesting, and I thought we could go in different directions, and it wouldn\'t be just a procedural. The character I thought was potentially quite wild and fun. But I wasn\'t sure if I wanted to settle into something like this, so I walked away from it initially, until [creator] Sam Baum came back to me for another run, and I took him more seriously. My kids were all about to hit the teen age, and I\'d heard that as much as you\'re not around when you\'re doing TV, you do get to go home. You\'re there at the weekend. You get to see your guys growing up. It was a chance to be around for that last chunk of childhood. So I got into it. Then we got picked up, which was great, but I wasn\'t sure it would succeed, if it would engage an audience on the kind of scale network television requires. But it seems to be working. And I\'ve really started to enjoy it. It\'s a very interesting experience, being involved in television. American television is very, very odd. And it will go on for as long as it goes on, but from my end, it\'s been this grand and bizarre experiment. I like playing the guy, and he\'s changing all the time. And they\'re writing good character stuff now this season. So hopefully he\'ll evolve and become even more mad. I think American TV is probably some of the best TV out there at the moment. But network TV is a whole different animal. Basically, we have to turn in, every eight or nine days, a little 43-minute film with a certain amount of twists in it, and it\'s quite a beast. You are completely in the hands of your writers and the talent of the people at the top. For me, it really was this weird test to see if I could find my way through it. It\'s a very strange world, but it\'s quite nice being a part of it.      Americans have bought - lock, stock and barrel - the Jeremy Irons - Kenneth Branagh England. And it\'s fake. It\'s an absolute con. Merchant-Ivory? Bollocks!      I think every director has a different take. Some are good, some are bad. The directors you get on best with sometimes don\'t make the best films. So who\'s to say who is right?      There is less pressure on a character actor. It generally means that you will be acting for all of your life, which is my intention. It is not my intention to be a rich and famous person. That would be pretty boring.      Bring back dueling, I say. Drive-by sword fight.      I have incredible stage fright. It\'s awful. Filming holds no fear for me. It\'s just where I live.      [on the ending of Planet of the Apes (2001)] I cannot explain that ending. I have seen it twice and I don\'t understand anything.      [on Planet of the Apes (2001)] They gave me a script after I said yes. It took me about 10 seconds. I answered the phone and was like, ""Tim Burton? Yes."" Then they gave me script and I read it. I didn\'t think the character was going to have any balls in the end. So I talked to Tim and asked him, ""Can I do this kind of stuff?"" I would get the pages in the morning and just learn them then. Then I would work with Tim [on the direction].      [on working with Charlton Heston] It was very difficult for me. On one level, there\'s the man and he\'s my dad. But on the other level, the whole NRA thing is what it is now. I\'m so against it, very vocally so. But it was inappropriate for the workplace. If I\'m going to talk to him, I\'ll talk to him outside the workplace. So it was just two guys in makeup doing a scene.      [on working with Charlton Heston] I was contracted so I couldn\'t get out of it. I feel very strongly about that monster. I made my feelings clear on set but got myself in make-up and put my gear on - including rubber hands so I wouldn\'t be infected if I touched him - and went in. We did the scene and I promptly left.      People remember villians. Sometimes in an action movie or sci-fi movie, being a villain is actually kind of interesting.      [on General Thade\'s temper in Planet of the Apes (2001)] I remember that from a documentary series. When they charge you, when they fight, they go insane. And then you\'re gone. It\'s over. They are very vicious at times.      [on the Planet of the Apes (1968) films] I was too young to grasp what the series meant to a lot of people. Certainly coming to America has been extraordinary. People have been a bit leery of [the 2001 version.] People take [the 1968 version] seriously and people are very fond of it so they want to make sure that you did a good job.      [on Planet of the Apes (2001)] I kept working on being an ape all the way through. I just kept pushing it and trying to invent new movements. One of the guys who worked at the Ape School became my stunt double so we just kept working on different things and just play around.      [on acting in ape makeup in Planet of the Apes (2001)] In a sense, it does work for you. You can take on the problems of the makeup and use them to your advantage. I was always working against the costume, it was compressing me all the time, so I used it to make my movements a little more liquid. The process became depressing and exhausting. It was quite a long shoot. Although I wasn\'t on every day, it still takes it out of you. But once you\'re in the role and the cameras start rolling, it\'s fun. I forget about the makeup. The makeup and costumes actually help me.      [on Tim Burton] He creates this bizarre, twisted, odd, nuts kind of worlds and you can\'t put your finger on them. They\'re always kind of glorious and enduring as well. You just want to be a part of it.      (On turning down Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)) ""They sent me the script. I don\'t know if that was the director\'s intention, obviously not! It was not something that appealed to me. Phoebe Cates was going to do it and wanted me to do it with her. I like Phoebe.

Inner conflict - that\'s where drama is.      Producers generally don\'t like me; directors do, generally. Convincing the producers is hard. They can\'t see the commercial value behind such a face, nor would they get a commercial value, necessarily - and I don\'t mean that in a good way or a bad way.      I like taking a path into new country, and I always take the darker path. Not because it\'s dark, but because there\'s a secret there that you can share when you get out. That\'s what I liked as a kid. That\'s how I approach my work. With a face like mine, it\'s lucky I have a heart that likes that.      I don\'t find anything interesting about the choices a character faces in major films or theater projects. The characters are just cut-out dolls with the American flag sewn on them.      I don\'t play roles everybody likes. I\'d rather have a career I\'m proud of. Like everyone else, I need to eat. But I\'m a very unbusinesslike person, and I keep my price low. I\'m not a mass product. I\'m not everyone\'s cup of tea.      I prefer theater, but I love to do films, and I prefer theater primarily because I\'ve done more. I know less about movies. You can\'t lie in either medium. The wonderful thing is that the camera, just like an audience, is made out of skin - because celluloid is skin.      I had a strong propensity, which I still have, to be invisible. In grade school, I\'d try to disappear and become formless. I lived in a very imaginary world. I loved poetry and wrote my first novel when I was 9. It was about a little girl and the people she met in the woods.      Before college, I acted in my room, to classical music, because music tells stories. I\'d put on a record and proceed, silently. I\'d keep putting the needle back to a certain segment because I hadn\'t died well enough. I had to really, really feel dead. I\'d love to do a death scene.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","[u'\nLaura Lovelace ', u'""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Mini Bio (1)          Laura Lovelace is an actress and director, known for Pulp Fiction (1994), Jackie Brown (1997) and Vegetables (1989).    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","[u'\nJohn Travolta ', u'""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 152 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(1)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(4)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(103)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(22)\xa0|Salary\xa0(18)  Overview (3)Date of Birth18\xa0February1954,\xa0Englewood, New Jersey, USA Birth NameJohn Joseph TravoltaHeight6\'\xa02""\xa0(1.88\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          John Joseph Travolta was born in Englewood, New Jersey, one of six children of Helen Travolta (n\xe9e Helen Cecilia Burke) and Salvatore/Samuel J. Travolta. His father was of Italian descent and his mother was of Irish ancestry. His father owned a tire repair shop called Travolta Tires in Hillsdale, NJ. Travolta started acting appearing in a local production of ""Who\'ll Save the Plowboy?"". His mother, herself an actress and dancer, enrolled him in a drama school in New York, where he studied voice, dancing and acting. He decided to combine all three of these skills and become a musical comedy performer. At 16 he landed his first professional job in a summer stock production of the musical ""Bye Bye Birdie"". He quit school at 16 and moved to New York, and worked regularly in summer stock and on television commercials. When work became scarce in New York, he went to Hollywood and appeared in minor roles in several series. A role in the national touring company of the hit 1950s musical ""Grease"" brought him back to New York. An opening in the New York production of ""Grease"" gave him his first Broadway role at age 18. After ""Grease"", he became a member of the company of the Broadway show ""Over Here"", which starred The Andrews Sisters. After ten months in ""Over Here"", he decided to try Hollywood once again.

Hit #106 on the Billboard Singles Charts in 1977 with ""Slow Dancing (Feels So Good)"" (Midland Int. 10977).      According to the documentary We Get to Win This Time (2002), the producers of Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) considered teaming up Sylvester Stallone with John Travolta as Rambo\'s young partner in rescuing the American POWs. Sylvester Stallone nixed this idea when he decided it would be better to make the film a solo project.      Spent nine months learning how to dance to disco music while filming Saturday Night Fever (1977).      He owns (and is qualified to fly as second in command) a Boeing 707-138, appropriately registered N707JT, first built in 1964 for QANTAS of Australia. Recently he had the aircraft painted in its original QANTAS paint-job and took it on a worldwide promotional tour for QANTAS and, in return, was trained as a 747-400 first officer with Qantas.      He has also worked as a musician and released several albums. He claims that he got all his inspiration from one song only; the instrumental song ""Dreamstreet"", a song by Patrick Rondat.      While filming the movie Blow Out (1981), he suffered from insomnia, which he had since he was a child waiting up for his mother to come home from late acting jobs. He learned to play the violin to calm his nerves.      In October 2004, he starred in a series of television commercials for Sky TV (meant for Italian TV). Directed by Harald Zwart, the television commercials play as a sitcom, where John Travolta - as himself - moves in with a working-class family because they have Sky.      He was voted the 64th Greatest Movie Star of all time by Entertainment Weekly.      Ranked #3 in TV Guide\'s list of ""TV\'s 25 Greatest Teen Idols"" (January 23, 2005 issue).

His first released record came out in 1976 when he had a Top 20 hit single, ""Let Her In"". When record producers saw him in Welcome Back, Kotter (1975) singing ""Barbara Anne"", originally by The Beach Boys, they signed him.      After the ""Grease"" album was released, he came out with a deluxe 2-record set called: ""Travolta Fever"", which was released in 1978.      His favorite movie is Un homme et une femme (1966). His favorite movie as a child was Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942).      During the 1970s, he frequently watched foreign films. One of his favorites was La Strada (1954).Oprah Winfrey\'s favorite movie star.      Best friends with Kirstie Alley.      He frequently eats at Denny\'s in the middle of the night. Which is where he ate through the movie Lucky Numbers (2000).      Was friends with James Cagney, Cary Grant and Barbara Stanwyck.      His favorite actor growing up was James Cagney.

He and his wife Kelly Preston sold it to Kathy Ireland for $3 million U.S. and she plans to rent the private residence out as one of several Kathy Ireland Worldwide company vacation villas.      Turned down several offers from the producers of Chicago (2002) to play the role of Billy Flynn. Richard Gere accepted the role and won a Golden Globe for his performance.      Got the role of Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction (1994) primarily because Michael Madsen, the actor for whom the role was written, was unavailable due to a prior film commitment. Vincent was the brother of Michael Madsen\'s character Vic Vega (aka Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs (1992)) and the role jump-started his career after a long slump.      His father was of Italian descent and his mother was of Irish ancestry. John\'s father, Salvatore/Samuel J. Travolta, was born in New Jersey, the son of Salvatore/Samuel Travolta and Giuseppina/Josephine Marsala. John\'s mother was born Helen Cecilia Burke, also in New Jersey, and was the daughter of Charles Frederick Burke and Mary Ellen Murphy.      Was considered for the role of Jim Morrison in The Doors (1991). The role went to Val Kilmer instead.      His performance as Tony Manero in Saturday Night Fever (1977) is ranked #73 on Premiere magazine\'s 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006).      On the Saturday Night Live (1975) episode, Saturday Night Live: John Travolta/Seal (1994), he parodied his Welcome Back, Kotter (1975) character Vinnie Barbarino.      His characters make mention of an Al Pacino film in at least three of his films: Saturday Night Fever (1977), Get Shorty (1995) and Swordfish (2001).      Owns a home in Ocala, Florida because of his wife\'s intense love of horses.      He lost 20 pounds for his role in Saturday Night Fever (1977).      Was strongly in the running to play Larry Meadows in The Last Detail (1973), only losing the role to Randy Quaid at the last minute. This would have been his big-screen debut.      Is good friends with actor Forest Whitaker who appeared with him in Phenomenon (1996) and Battlefield Earth (2000).      Was among the guests at Tom Cruise\'s and Katie Holmes\' wedding ceremony in Italy.      (April 2, 2007) On his return flight from Germany to New York, the actor was forced to make an emergency landing in his Boeing 707 at Ireland\'s Shannon Airport. He\'d been promoting his new movie in Europe and encountered technical difficulties on his return flight. Fortunately for the actor, he was flying over Ireland at the time he first detected his private jet\'s engine problems and was safely diverted to Shannon on Ireland\'s west coast. Not allowing himself to be fazed by the whole ordeal, Travolta grounded his 34-seater and continued his flight home on a commercial airline.      Friends with actor Billy Lockwood.      In 1985, Princess Diana asked him to dance at a party at the White House.      For his acting, drew inspiration from James Cagney, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and others.      Master of Ceremony at the Centennial of Flight Celebration at Kitty Hawk in December 2003, where he presented to John Glenn aviation\'s highest award.      Has been the Ambassador for Qantas since 2001.      He also owns an Eclipse 500 twin turbofan aircraft.      Has appeared in Hairspray (2007), opposite Michelle Pfeiffer, whose debut film was Grease 2 (1982), the sequel to Grease (1978), in which Travolta appeared.      Has claimed his favorite director to work with was Sylvester Stallone, for Staying Alive (1983). He said Stallone knew how to make him look the best on screen.      Stated that one of his favorite places is Gander, Newfoundland, Canada.Jett Travolta, his 16-year-old son, died following a seizure at the family\'s Bahamas holiday retreat on January 2, 2009.      His publicist is Paul Bloch.      He was offered the role of Melvin Udall in As Good as It Gets (1997), which went to Jack Nicholson.      Close friends with Dakota Fanning and Robin Williams.      Was considered for the role of Lester Burnham in American Beauty (1999) but Kevin Spacey, who went on to win a Best Actor Oscar for his performance, was cast instead.      He was offered Richard Gere\'s role in An Officer and a Gentleman (1982), and opted to go to American Airlines\' jet pilot school, instead.      Owns a vacation home on a small island in Maine\'s Penobscot Bay. The secluded 20-room ch\xe2teau, surrounded by acres of pines, overlooks the ocean and comfortably accommodates up to 50 guests. He bought it because Christmas is his favorite holiday, and he wanted a place big enough to house his extended family.      Was married to Kelly Preston on September 5, 1991 at the Hotel de Crillon in Paris in a private ceremony. A small orchestra performed the main theme from Un homme et une femme (1966), Travolta\'s favourite French film.      He was due to have played the lead role in The Double, an adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky\'s novel about a man whose life is taken over by his doppelganger. He was being paid $17m and shooting was to have started in Paris in June 1996. Just days before principal photography was due to begin, he flew back to the United States following an argument with the film\'s director, Roman Polanski, over alleged changes to the script and the film collapsed shortly afterwards.      Lives in Los Angeles, California and Anthony, Florida.      (May 18, 2010) John and his wife, Kelly Preston, are expecting their third child.      He was inducted into the 2011 New Jersey Hall of Fame for his contributions to the Arts and Entertainment.      Third child, a son named Benjamin, was born in a Florida hospital on November 23, 2010 at 8 lbs. 3 oz.      Stepbrother-in-law of Chris Palzis.      Son-in-law of Peter Palzis.      On Inside the Actors Studio: Episode #9.13 (2003), he listed Les valseuses (1974) as his favorite movie.      John and his wife, Kelly Preston, have the distinction of having both starred in movies based on Stephen King novels, where the title of each was a girl\'s name which began with the letter ""C"". John starred in Carrie (1976) and Kelly starred in Christine (1983).      In 1986, he was slated to co-star with Whoopi Goldberg in a buddy/action-comedy called ""Public Enemies"", produced by the Cannon Group. In it, he would have played a disgruntled cop who is teamed up with a reckless young rookie, played by Goldberg, to uncover the whereabouts of a notorious mob figure. Bud Yorkin was attached to direct. Even though it was heavily publicized at the Cannes Film Festival, funding fell through and the project was scrapped.      Although he is often cast as Italian-American and is of Italian descent on his father\'s side, he has stated that his family was invested more in his mother\'s Irish ancestry, and he grew up mostly around Irish culture.      Was good friends with the late James Gandolfini. His father sold tires to James\' father.      Speaks French fluently.      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6901 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on June 5, 1985.      In honor of his 60th birthday on February 18, 2014, there was a special singalong showing of Grease (1978) at the Million Dollar Theater in Los Angeles. Before the start of the movie a video tribute from Olivia Newton-John was played followed by a thank you video from John Travolta.      Has starred in films that appear in both IMDb\'s Top 250 and IMDb\'s Bottom 100. The highest of his IMDb Top 250 film is at 5th position with Pulp Fiction (1994). The lowest of his entry in IMDb\'s Bottom 100 is on 73th (number 27 from the bottom) with Battlefield Earth (2000). [March 2014]      He auditioned to play Jesus Christ in Jesus Christ Superstar (1973), which went to Ted Neeley.      When introducing Idina Menzel at the 2014 Academy Awards, he mistakenly pronounced her name as ""Adele Dazeem"". The flub has since drawn a lot of attention and ridicule (including a Twitter account for Adele Dazeem). Travolta apologized to Menzel and sent her a bouquet of flowers.      He turned down the role played by Johnny Depp in Nick of Time (1995).      He presented the Oscar for Best Actor at the 55th Academy Awards in 1983. The winner was Ben Kingsley for Gandhi (1982).      Travolta selected Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942) as his all-time favorite film as part of an AFI poll.      Turned down the role of Dave Seville in Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007).      Was offered the role of the Green Goblin in Spider-Man (2002).Michael Jackson\'s song ""Wanna Be Startin\' Somethin\'"" (1983) was originally written for Travolta but ultimately ended up as Michael\'s own personal recording from his 1982 ""Thriller"" album. Travolta would later appear as one of several celebrity cameos in Michael Jackson: Liberian Girl (1989).      In 2014 John received the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) Award for Outstanding Achievement in International Cinema.      John stars in three of the top 150 Greatest Movies of All Time, as listed by Empire Magazine: Blow Out (#139), Carrie (#86), Pulp Fiction (#9) [August 2015].      John Travolta was recently named one of the Most Valuable Actors of All Time, with the total gross of his films coming in at $4.3 billion.      John Travolta has had 5 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart from 1976-1978: ""Grease Lightnin"" (#47), ""Whenever I\'m Away From You"" (#38), ""All Strung Out On You"" (#34), ""Let Her In"" (#10), and ""You\'re the One That I Want"", which peaked at #1 and was on the chart for 24 weeks.      10 of John\'s films have grossed over $100 million in the US: Grease, Wild Hogs, Saturday Night Fever, Look Who\'s Talking, Hairspray, Bolt, Face/Off, Pulp Fiction, Phenomenon and General\'d Daughter; 8 of these have grossed over $200 million worldwide.      After starting his career on the TV show ""Welcome Back, Kotter,"" John Travolta\'s film career took off in the late 1970\'s with starring roles in ""Saturday Night Fever"", which earned him an Oscar nomination for best actor in a leading role, and ""Grease"". Adjusted for inflation, these remain the two highest grossing films of Travolta\'s career.      John was the winner of the Juno Award for International Single of the Year for ""You\'re the One That I Want"" in 1979.      Turned down the role of Forrest Gump in Forrest Gump (1994), a decision he later admitted was a mistake.Personal Quotes (22)      [on his role in Carrie (1976)]: I wanted to work with Brian De Palma. I knew the film would be interesting and attract a lot of attention.      I have fame on the level of a Marilyn Monroe or an Elvis Presley, but part of the reason I didn\'t go the way they did was because of my beliefs. People make judgments about Scientology, but often they don\'t know what they\'re talking about.      There is nothing gay in this movie (Hairspray (2007)). I\'m not playing a gay man. Scientology is not homophobic in any way. In fact, it\'s one of the more tolerant faiths. Anyone\'s accepted.      When they asked me to be Edna Turnblad I said, ""Gee, 32 years as a leading man -- why me? What makes you think I\'d be the perfect woman?"".      As you get older, you have to force yourself to have new dreams. For instance, I\'ve been flying for 37 years but now teaching others to fly is interesting for me. Sometimes, you have to find new angles on life to keep you interested, like sharing successes and inspiring and helping others. You have to go out of your way to activate your dreams and keep them going in this third chapter of your life.      [on his role as Edna in Hairspray (2007)] It was tough dancing in high heels, but we did change the heels to more of a dance shoe - like a Capezio. You know they kept giving me these skinny high heels and it\'s like, ""Okay, I understand those. My mother wore those."" However, when I was growing up and I saw girls in the chorus, they had a thicker heel and it was a dance shoe and I kept telling them to find those shoes. I knew they existed, and finally they brought out a shoe and I said, ""That\'s the shoe! Now make it in many colors."".      [on Saturday Night Fever (1977)]: I love being regarded as a sex symbol, but I can\'t take it too seriously.      [on how the late James Gandolfini consoled him after the death of his son] James went out of his way to come to Florida and he would not leave Florida until I was okay, or he felt that I would be fine. After a week I said, \'Jim you can really, you can, you know, we\'ll be fine. I\'ve got a lot of support here.\' But the idea that in our profession someone would go out of their way and not want to leave you until he felt you were okay, that\'s the kind of soul that James Gandolfini was. My father sold tires to his father. I was his inspiration to get into the business. He would see pictures of me on the wall from movies and he decided that he wanted to be an actor. He was a people person first and then everything else. He was this beautiful man and I love him very much.      [on being cast in Pulp Fiction (1994)] There was a rumor that a young new director who had directed a film called Reservoir Dogs (1992) was quite interested in working with me. And his name was Quentin Tarantino. I said, ""Sounds good. He\'s talented. I saw the movie. I would love to meet him, too."" After six or seven hours of hanging out, he verbally presented two ideas to me. One was the vampire movie From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) and the other one was Pulp Fiction. I responded to Pulp Fiction but I didn\'t respond to From Dusk Till Dawn, and he noticed that. So at the end of the meeting he said, ""I\'m curious. You seem to like the Pulp Fiction one, but you did not respond as much to the other."" I said, ""Well, it\'s simple, Quentin. I\'m just not a vampire guy."".      To be honest, I thought ""Pulp"" would have the same fate as Reservoir Dogs (1992), meaning it would be an art house movie that would have a smaller audience. I never thought it would have a mainstream audience; I thought it was too unique of a movie to hit a commercial note. And when it did, it surprised all of us, I think, because we were going to be fine with it having the same success as Reservoir Dogs. But that it would become Forrest Gump (1994) was a whole other idea.      My best quality? The transparency in my eyes. I only have to think a thought and it\'s seen.      I don\'t think I\'m very cool as a person. I\'m just better than anyone else at acting cool.      [on dancing with Princess Diana at the White House in 1985] There really was something lovely and girlish about her and I felt that I had taken her back to her childhood when she had probably watched Grease (1978) and for that moment I was her Prince Charming.      [on his plans for after the 2014 Oscars ceremony] I don\'t drink very much, but I wait until Oscar night to have my drinks. So now I\'m ready to stay out until five in the morning. We\'re gonna do Vanity Fair, then we\'re gonna do Madonna\'s party, and we\'re gonna have fun tonight. I\'m not gonna be happy until we see the sun rise.      Every time I did an interview after Moment by Moment (1978), they went right for the negative things first. I feel that the criticism after the film became abusive. It went beyond mere criticism. You would have thought Lily (Tomlin) and I had committed murder. I thought, my God, don\'t ever do a movie people don\'t like; they\'ll murder you.      One\'s own life is not as colourful as a character that\'s created in a movie because they go through a million colours in a short period of time. In one\'s own life, it may take four years to go through those colours.      [on the death of his teenage son Jett] The worst thing that\'s ever happened in my life. The truth is, I didn\'t know if I was going to make it. Life was no longer interesting to me, so it took a lot to get me better.      [on the death of Robin Williams] I\'ve never known a sweeter, brighter, more considerate person than Robin. Robin\'s commitment as an artist to lifting our mood and making us happy is compared to none. He loved us all and we loved him back.      [2014] My films have an interesting continuous effect. Grease (1978) for some reason never went away. Do you know that to this day, every year, the Hollywood Bowl charges $275 a ticket to sit in an audience with a 36-year-old film and sing along to it? I\'ve never heard of anything like that in my life. So there is some magic to that particular film. There\'s other films like The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Gone with the Wind (1939) that don\'t end either, but this has a continuous new audience, as opposed to, ""oh, that\'s an old movie"". No one looks at Grease as an old movie. It just keeps on living. That\'s how I view it, as a gift to the public and myself as an ongoing thing.      [2014] In the old days, you didn\'t do a movie three times a year; you did a movie once every year and a half or every three years. You had a lot of time between films. I remember taking violin lessons, painting lessons, French lessons, you know, to fill my time. Otherwise you get in trouble. But the memories of all the films are wonderful.      My mother was an acting teacher. She taught more of the existentialist style, which was that acting is believing that you\'re in the moment with the other actor, and I like that. I\'m more comfortable portraying what I\'m feeling at the moment and not knowing what I\'m going to do next.      I watched this Fellini movie when I was five called La Strada (1954) and I said to my father: ""Why did Giulietta Masina die?"" and he said: ""She died of a broken heart."" ""You can die of a broken heart?"" He said: ""Yes, you can be so sad that you can die of a broken heart."" ""Without being ill?"" He said: ""Yes!"" It changed my whole life. I never wanted to break anyone\'s heart, for sure! But it made me consider that. Most kids were considering other things; I was considering Giulietta Masina in a Fellini film.Salary (18)Pulp Fiction\xa0(1994)      $150,000       White Man\'s Burden\xa0(1995)      $500,000       Get Shorty\xa0(1995)      $4,250,000       Broken Arrow\xa0(1996)      $8,000,000       Phenomenon\xa0(1996)      $8,000,000       Michael\xa0(1996)      $12,000,000       Face/Off\xa0(1997)      $20,000,000       Mad City\xa0(1997)      $20,000,000       Primary Colors\xa0(1998)      $17,000,000       A Civil Action\xa0(1998)      $20,000,000       The General\'s Daughter\xa0(1999)      $20,000,000       Battlefield Earth\xa0(2000)      $10,000,000 + Profit Points      Lucky Numbers\xa0(2000)      $22,000,000 plus 20% of gross      Swordfish\xa0(2001)      $20,000,000       Basic\xa0(2003)      $15,000,000       Ladder 49\xa0(2004)      $20,000,000       Be Cool\xa0(2005)      $20,000,000       Hairspray\xa0(2007)       US$14,000,000 including ca.

Their dialogue\nis witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes\nthese two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you\nmight assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to\nwork. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which\nthey use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk\nhas no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that\nmatter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp\nFiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever\nstruck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent\nbut wonderfully textured.<br><br>It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the\nsuitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably\nintended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many\nastonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first\nviewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But\nthere is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title\nindicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a\nbrilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other\nfilms, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It\nhas all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine\nwriting, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the\nmost well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what\nend? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything\nbut itself.<br><br>The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's\nessentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the\nthree main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form\nthe subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes\nwrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation\nto come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to\nabsurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to\nfocus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they\nmove the story away from conventional plot developments.<br><br>Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions.\nIndeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character\never says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could\nhave simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,""\nwhich is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill\naction flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is\nlike. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a\npotential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with\nclever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they\nare full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of\nMia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody\nspecial: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and\ncomfortably enjoy the silence.""<br><br>What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a\nlot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who\nlooms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The\nwhole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite\nsection of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men\nwithout even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in\nways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced\nwith an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme\nalso helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film,\nits liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used\nas an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point\napplies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with\nrace. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance\nover weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in\npractice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a\nlevel of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding\ncitizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a\npatter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.<br><br>There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that\nVincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty.\nLater, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're\nnever sure.

It is\nboth a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and\nunforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem\noutdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. \nMiramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before\nthis film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they\nknew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making\nbecame the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated\nBest Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and\ndirection by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. \nJohn Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. \nBruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman\n(both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make\nappearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna\nArquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin\nTarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L.\nJackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may\nhave cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved\ndeserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5.\n   \n</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nI can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish,\ncleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone\nwhen I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the\nstart is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the\ndialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all\nthe other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense\nof realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical\nabout their lines \x96 it's a mixture that immediately grabs your\nattention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of\nhamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage).\nThen there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece\nfit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of\nmusic are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the\nnarrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly\nused flashbacks, the use of ""chapters"" \x96 there is so much playful\ncreativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.<br><br>If you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about\nfilm and love for the work of other greats \x96 and inspiration from them\n- went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of\nhyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino\nof copying or even ""stealing"" from other film-makers I can only say:\nThere has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT\ninspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch\nTarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just\nwhat a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies\n- especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp\nFiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's\ngot simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson);\nit features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it\nhas arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such\na crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it\nfor the first time.

How much else is there to talk about it after all these\nyears? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action,\ngreat and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also,\nthe acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward,\nover the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The\ndirecting is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he\nmakes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never\nin a way that would be distracting.

His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and\nclaustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even\nthough Rodriguez's was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage\nto the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. However, Pulp Fiction remains my\nfavourite.<br><br>It was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe\nthat it only got one: Best original script. I'm not complaining because\nForrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but\ncome on, movies like Tarantino's or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much\nmore.<br><br>Anyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second\nchapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's\nfinest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a\ngreat job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right\nafter having read the script. I like the way his character gives a ""tough\nguy"" image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and\ntender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his\nsecond encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene\nwhere\nhe dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest\npoint.<br><br>The other star is Samuel L.

""And I will strike down upon thee\nwith great vengeance and furious anger..."" is my favourite\nquote.<br><br>Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who\nis at least aware of what a movie is.

In hindsight, however, it seems to\nme that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall\nthey weren't sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what\nwere probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I\nfeel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine\nreviews already on this database.<br><br>First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say,\nAPOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just\nas disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didn't\nthink it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of\ngraphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture\nfor everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born\nin the 1930's (even to my one fairly ""hip"" relative of the same\ngeneration who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and\nlikes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other\npotentially sensitive issues).<br><br>Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers,\nsupported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full\nof the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on\nscreen. From Travolta's pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about\nthe world to Jackson's sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating\nand Willis's deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such\nfascination lies not only in the characters' personalities as they are\nportrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the\npossibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some\nyears' experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly\ndrawn to this aspect of the film.<br><br>Thus, and in response to some other reviewers' comments, I think this\nmovie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story\npeopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as\na mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in\nthe movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and\nunpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially\nsecondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get\nyou worried about the fate of characters you can't help caring about\ndespite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for\ntheir respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when\nthe film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these\ncrazy people and their explosive lives.<br><br>Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of\nanother Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically\nassociate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in\nthat film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested,\nperhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional\nimpact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of\nseveral different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor -\nwith the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution\nin every department. And while CASABLANCA is no doubt clearly much more\nwholesome and high-minded, like the older film PULP FICTION is not\nwithout a pronounced theme of redemption, even if it is not as strongly\nfelt, considering all the later film's sleaze and violence.<br><br>In sum, when people say that this is probably the best film of the\n1990's, it is easy to see why. Fundamentally a truly outstanding movie,\nit is a must-see for anyone who considers themself a film buff and can\nhandle graphic subject matter.<br><br>(Incidentally, if you would like a more toned-down, much more overtly\nhumorous and less serious picture with a not-altogether dissimilar look\nand feel, don't miss another 1990's Travolta picture, GET SHORTY.)\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><a href=""reviews-enter"">Add another review</a></p>>], [<bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\n*********Spoiler Warning**********<br><br>When this movie came out a lot of people I knew were making a big deal about\nit because it was made by a guy from Knoxville who even talked about K-town\nin the movie---and guess where I lived at the time?  Most people overlooked\nthat Tarantino was only born there and lived most of his life somewhere\nelse, and both Tarantino and Knoxville are highly overrated.  Trust\nme.<br><br>I can't see why this movie is regarded as highly as it is; it seems the key\nto Tarantino's storytelling is to mix together story elements kind of like a\nblender.  So we get things like the cab driver who's a sexy latin woman\nwho'd look more at home in a luxury restaurant than a grungy cab, or the\nvery seventies looking Samuel L.

The result is the average person goes ""that's kind\nof strange,"" while the intelligentsia go ""yes, the man is a\nGENIUS!""<br><br>I put off seeing this movie for several years because of the supposed\nextreme violence and the notorious rape scene.

In the end the violence was\nmainly psychological or limited, although the guy getting shot in the car\nand bits of you-know getting everywhere was a real turn-off.<br><br>But really what did the movie in for me was the plot, or lack thereof. \nSupposedly we're getting an homage to film noir and hardboiled fiction\nnovels of the forties, done up in a modern story theme.

There are those who believe that the\ndirector who began his career as a humble video store clerk with a\nvoracious appetite for movies of every conceivable style is talented\nand worth imitating. While Tarantino has made some movies worth\ndiscussing for their positive qualities (Reservoir Dogs is, by far, his\nbest effort), this group of movies is rather small, especially\nconsidering that he has only directed five movies. There is another\nschool of thought who regards his works as inane, self-indulgent, and\nbloated. Pulp Fiction, written and directed by Tarantino, and released\nin 1994, is his most divisive movie simply by virtue of being his most\nwell-known. Upon its release, it was hailed as a warning shot to a\ncomplacent Hollywood- the maverick behind the indie hit Reservoir Dogs\napparently had something else up his sleeve.<br><br>Pulp Fiction is ostensibly a crime story featuring the interconnecting\nlives of several characters. However, upon repeat viewings, the viewer\nbegins to wonder exactly what that something is. Personally, I found\nthis movie ran too long in spots, likely because Tarantino is so\nridiculously in love with the sound of his own voice as spoken by\ndifferent actors that he is afraid to cut one speech or even a single\nline. Dialogue, though it doesn't necessarily need to serve the story\nto justify its inclusion, should not be so dense as to drive the viewer\nout of the experience. When John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, on the\nway to retrieving a briefcase for their employer, are talking about\nEuropean hamburgers and foot massages, the scene plays like a witty\nouttake- as though the actors so understood the style of the movie that\nthey were in that they felt comfortable riffing with the material. Not\nso- the rest of the movie is filled with conversations of a similar\ntype, including (but not limited to) body piercing, blueberry pancakes,\nhamburgers (again), and coffee (this one performed by Quentin Tarantino\nhimself, as though he couldn't wait to get a shot at delivering his own\nlines).<br><br>The strangest thing is, while the characters are ""in character"", as\nSamuel L. Jackson says in an opening scene, the movie is quite\nenjoyable. When the characters are placed into real confrontations, the\nmovie takes on an entirely different persona and becomes at least a\ndecent crime movie. Ultimately, however, these scenes are few and far\nbetween and, unfortunately, the movie clocks in at 154 minutes. There's\nreally only a decent short film in all of this.<br><br>The movie also lacks what I would call a plot. The movie is described\nas three stories about one story, though that one story (ending,\nchronologically, with Bruce Willis and his irritating Euro girlfriend\nriding off into the sunset) doesn't connect the characters enough to be\ntruly about one thing.<br><br>Ultimately the movie is a prime example of what happens when a VCR and\na wide selection of movies replace film school. The movie lacks a\ncoherent center and seems more like something that was made for the\nsake of just committing something to film and resurrecting the flagging\ncareer of John Travolta. The movie is too large in scope to sustain\nitself, and, in the end, implodes because there is really no conviction\nbehind the presentation- too concerned with being a hipster-cool riff\non a crime story, rife with pop in-jokes and 70's music (perhaps the\nbest part of the movie is the soundtrack), somebody must have neglected\nto mention that the movie went nowhere and lacked the momentum to even\nget there.<br><br>While all of these qualities combine to form a truly deplorable viewing\nexperience, I do have to mention Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson as\ntwo performers in this movie who, I felt, got away clean. Bruce Willis\nprobably gets away with it because he's alone for the majority of his\nsegment and, therefore, doesn't have anybody with whom to trade\ndespicably derisible dialogue. Samuel L. Jackson gets a mention because\nof the scene at the very end of the movie in which he confronts Tim\nRoth's character and makes him realize that there are far more fearsome\npowers at work in the world than robbing a diner. In fact, the scenes\ncoming directly at the beginning and the end of the movie are the two\nbest, and everything else is filler.<br><br>As you no doubt have guessed, I fall squarely in the latter of the two\ngroups I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Pulp Fiction is\ninane, self-indulgent, and bloated.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nSorry for the image, but if you take a bowl of crap, rearrange it, put\nsome sugar and a little cherry on top, what to you get? ... a bowl of\ncrap.<br><br>This is the most overrated film of all time.

It has no story, no feelings, no plot, no music -\njust 4 different scenes of disgusting, violent, abusive, offending and\nracist content put together in a mixed sequence.<br><br>How this crap scores a 9 on IMDb is beyond me. Sometimes when people\nsee a 9 they automatically deceive themselves into believing this is a\nmasterpiece and that maybe if they didn't like it, something is wrong\nwith their opinion or taste. Nothing's wrong. It's a bad movie from\nbeginning to end.

However,\ndespite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance\nput forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an\nOscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner\nthat year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the\nmost commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting,\ngodfearing hitman. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still\nsends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it.

It won Original\nScreenplay. It was nominated for six other Oscars including Best\nPicture and Best Director. I see it is given four out of four stars if\nit is on TV. It is also in IMDb's Top 250. (But) what is the big deal\nabout it? I was bored and disappointed. Pulp Fiction did not really\nmake a whole lot of sense. I can not remember if it was nominated for\nediting or not. If they wanted to be in that category or have a better\nchance at winning then obviously more editing should have happened. I\ndo not see the point of Vince and Mia's date. All if not a lot of that\nshould have been cut. Why drag on Bruce Willis being on the run from\nthe mafia don? That took too long. Was the whole story about the watch\nnecessary? Couldn't Bruce and his woman just talk about it? Aside from\nbeing disappointing and boring Pulp Fiction was confusing. Bruce shoots\nJohn Travolta. And kills him. So how is he alive in The Bonnie\nSituation? Does Quentin Tarrantino not like editing too much? Well more\nediting could be needed a lot of times.(PF hint hint.) So yeah Pulp\nFiction was boring, disappointing, confusing, etc. It should not have\nwon Original Screenplay. It should have gone to someone else but if all\nfive nominees were bad then it should have been none of them. Too much\nhype. Too much movie. Overrated. I can not remember much of this movie\nand happily so. So what is such the big deal?\n</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><a href=""reviews-enter"">Add another review</a></p>>]]"

The recording session started late, and Sean had an earlier commitment to introduce friend Joe Pantoliano who was M.C.\'ing at a local theatre. Left the recording studio to change clothes, then returned to explain why he had to leave, give a ""shout out to Joey Pants,"" and left an action figure of Sam Gamgee to take his place.

During a break in principal photography from the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, Astin directed trilogy director Peter Jackson and fellow cast members in a five-minute short film, The Long and Short of It (2003), about camaraderie and friendship within difficult working environments, which mirrored a significant theme of the trilogy. Astin was able to borrow a cutting-edge digital camera from Lucasfilm representatives (who had been demonstrating the camera for Jackson) for a day to make the short. The film was included as a bonus on the DVD release of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002).

[May 2005]      His casting in the fifth season of 24 (2001) came about by sheer luck. One day at his chiropractor\'s, he discovered that Joel Surnow was also a patient; they had a short meeting and Surnow offered him the role of Lynn McGill.      Narrated the American version of Meerkat Manor. The British version was narrated by Bill Nighy, who also preceded him in the role of Sam Gamgee.

Auditioned for the role of Chris Chambers in Stand by Me (1986).Personal Quotes (11)      I was told I had to gain a lot of weight because Hobbits are very portly. Peter [Peter Jackson] is forever suggesting I have more food: ""A little more food for Mr. Astin.""      [refuting the remarks of cast and crew that he IS Samwise Gamgee] But I\'m not really Sam . . . nobody could be that good, that noble. He\'s just better than the rest of us. I\'m a lot more Hollywood than Sam would ever be.      I\'d never heard of the ""Lord of the Rings"", actually. So I went to the bookstore and there it was, three shelves of books about Tolkien and Middle-earth, and I was like, ""Holy cow, what else am I missing out on?""      [12/18/03, about the scene in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) in which Sam helps Frodo up Mount Doom] It was an incredible acting experience, being on the side of a volcano with that language. That language is so beautiful: ""It\'ll be springtime soon, and they\'ll be sowing barley on the fields."" When Peter [Peter Jackson] came up to tell me to lower my arm, something like that, tears were streaming down his face, and to see him that emotional just forced me into it . . . It [finally seeing the last three reels of the film] was a huge cry. It was all of the tension and stress and pressure of having a wife and children, having a career, the investment of these movies. I was sobbing and heaving, I could barely breathe, and the movie facilitated that. It was just a huge release.      [12/14/03, on his character Sam Gamgee] I spent the film doing lots of things, but the crying is what lived. He [Peter Jackson] tricks you into thinking you\'re going to get to do all these brave, heroic things most of the time, and you have to cry once in a while . . . and then he cuts out the heroic moments and you\'re left thinking, ""I look like a big baby"".      [2/12/04] I don\'t care if I\'m 5\'7"" and pretty heavy, weight-wise, in the film [the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy]. I still see myself as Errol Flynn. Even when I was a little boy, playing war games in the back yard, I pictured myself as the hero.      [2/12/04] I remember, before we started principal photography on The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), Peter Jackson screened Braveheart (1995) and The Thin Red Line (1998) for the cast. He said, ""This is the tone I want to strike with the Ring movies. I want to see the grime on their faces, the dirt on the ground, and I want that level of gritty emotionalism and intensity."" I think his idea was that you can enjoy the fantasy more if you really believe it.      [2/12/04, on souvenirs from Middle-earth] I got Sam\'s backpack, which began to feel like a second skin, albeit a very uncomfortable skin. I also got to keep Sam\'s sword, as well as some Hobbit feet and ears. I can take them out and make the whole family smile!      The sidekick business has been good to me.      [on Rudy (1993)] I loved this movie because it shows that if you work hard, you can achieve anything.      I have a very eclectic kind of upbringing in regards to religiosity or religion. You know, my mom was sort of a Catholic and then a lapsed Catholic and then an ex-communicated Catholic and then a brought-back-into-the-fold Catholic and then a kind of Shirley Maclaine New Age kind of something-or-other (laughter). And then my dad was very secular, raised by a school-teacher as a mom and a scientist as a father and then I was in Catholic school for three years as a kid; there was a confirmation process and I wanted to be confirmed, I had never been baptized. And so I asked if I could be baptized and he said no, not until I was 18. And then he discovered Buddhism a few years later and he wanted me to be a Buddhist, and so I kinda practiced Buddhism for a little while, and my older brother was sort of a swinging singles guy who discovered a guy named Swami Vivekananda and like shaved his head and went to India when I was like 10 or 11. And he was someone who I always admired, so I kind of got to see that strain. My biological father is Jewish and I never really knew him until I was 25 but then I did so he\'s kind of an interesting and wonderful man who I\'ve gotten to know over the last few years, so there\'s kind of that strand.    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","[u'\nDavid Aston ', u'""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Mini Bio (1)          David Aston is an actor, known for The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), The Matrix (1999) and Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009).    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","[u'Everard Proudfoot', u'""""']","[u'Elanor Gamgee', u'""""']","[u'Samwise Gamgee', u'""Samwise Gamgee also known as Sam is a Hobbit of the Shire. He is Frodo Baggins\'s gardener and his companion on his journey to Mount Doom. When Gandalf comes to the Shire to tell Frodo the truth about the ring he inherited from his uncle Bilbo, he catches Sam eavesdropping, and orders him to go with Frodo on his journey. They are joined en route to Rivendell by Meriadoc ""Merry"" Brandybuck and Peregrin ""Pippin"" Took, two of Frodo\'s cousins, and Strider, a D\xfanedain ranger of the North. At Rivendell, Frodo volunteers to take the Ring to Mount Doom to destroy it, and Sam volunteers to go with him. They are joined by the other hobbits and Strider, now revealed as Aragorn, last heir to the throne of Gondor, along with Gandalf, Gimli the Dward, Legolas the Elf, and Boromir, a man from Gondor, elder son of the Steward, Denethor II.Frodo ultimately decides that he must leave the Fellowship behind and continue on his own, but Sam insists on going with him. They soon capture Gollum and force him to act as their guide, though Sam is always suspicious of the wretched creature. His fears are later vindicated when Gollum leads Frodo into the lair of Shelob, a giant spider, hoping that Frodo will be killed and he could then take the Ring.Sam saves Frodo from Shelob, but Frodo has been stung by Shelob, and it appears to Sam as if he is dead. Later, when Orcs approach, Sam takes the Ring, and intends to go on alone, and complete the mission given to Frodo. However, he overhears the Orcs talking and discovers that Frodo isn\'t dead, simply paralyzed by Shelob\'s poison. The Orcs take Frodo to the tower of Cirith Ungol on the western border of Mordor, Sam following all the way. Sam rescues Frodo from the Orcs and returns the Ring to him, and they travel toward Mount Doom once again.Frodo grows progressively weaker under the influence of the Ring, and Sam\'s help is essential in getting him through Mordor to Mount Doom, once physically carrying him up the mountain until attacked by Gollum. There Frodo goes on alone, as Sam fends off Gollum. After seemingly defeating Gollum, he follows Frodo, urging him to throw the Ring into the fire, a scene shockingly similar to that which had happened 3000 years before, when Elrond told Isildur to destroy the Ring. Frodo decides to keep the Ring, and as he puts it on Sam is knocked out by Gollum, who then attacks Frodo, in a desperate fight to the death over possession of the ring. Sam watches the fight between them, until Frodo and Gollum topple over the precipice. Sam rescues Frodo, but Gollum and the ring perish in the volcano.At the end, Sam returned to the Shire, and married the one that he loved, Rosie Cotton, and they had many children: Elanor (named after the flower in Lorien), Goldilocks, Frodo, Pippin, Merry, Hamfast, Rose, and others. He continued to look after Frodo, particularly on the two days of year where he always fell ill, the day on which the ring perished, and the day on which he was pierced by the Morgul blade, until Frodo left for Valinor. He always felt somewhat guilty for his fame in Hobbiton, for he, Merry, and Pippin were hailed as heroes for saving the Shire from the ""Boss"", ""Sharkey"" aka Saruman, who had taken over the Shire. He felt Frodo deserved fame much more than he, but Frodo liked the anonymity.Sam was mayor of Hobbiton for many years.

This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat\nlost\nwithin the epic battles of `Two Towers,' at that's the ring. The first\ninstallment, `The Fellowship of the Ring,' provided heaps of exposition on\nthe ring's importance and influence, and in `Return of the King,' we see\nit\npay off, big time.<br><br>After the armies of Isengard have been defeated due to an allegiance\nbetween Theoden (Bernard Hill), the king of Rohan, and the elves, the main\nthreat to middle earth is now concentrated in the kingdom of Mordor,\ncontrolled by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron has turned his eye towards the\nrealm of Gondor, the last free kingdom of men, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian\nMcKellan) must warn Denethor (John Noble), Steward of Gondor of the\nimpending attack, while Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), heir to the throne of\nGondor, and Theoden gather men to aid against the armies of Mordor. The\ndark\nlord Sauron needs only to regain the one ring of power to conquer all of\nmiddle earth, and two hobbits, Frodo (Elijah Wood) the ring-bearer and Sam\n(Sean Astin), must continue their journey, directed by Gollum, to Mount\nDoom, the only place where the ring can be destroyed. Got all that? If\nnot,\nyou need to bone up on your `Lord of the Rings' before expecting to follow\nthis film.<br><br>Since all three epics were filmed simultaneously, each individually has\nthe feel of being part of a larger picture - except for this one. `The\nReturn of the King' is just too big, the most epic of a set of epic films.\nNow that director Peter Jackson has brilliantly constructed the characters\nand plotlines throughout the first two films, he puts them to use.<br><br>All of the characters have their best moments within this film. The\npair\nof mischievous hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd),\nare no longer the tree ornaments they were from `Two Towers,' but are\nsplit-up, and take their characters in completely new directions. Aragorn,\nplayed with an unmatched sense of honor by Viggo Mortenson, is about to\nmeet\nhis destiny as the future king of all men, while Andy Serkis continues his\nexpert portrayal of Gollum (Serkis' provided not only the voice of Gollum,\nbut also assisted during production by acting out the scenes of the\ncomputer-generated character with his fellow actors).<br><br>However, the real acting triumph of the film is Elijah Wood as Frodo\nBaggins. He continues his descent into corruption with an incredible\ntalent\nthat many could not pull off. Wood's performance is so critical to the\nfilm\nbecause it determines the ring's power to corrupt, which, needless to say,\nis absolute.<br><br>The first two films established Jackson as an incredible visionary,\nshooting vast landscapes from his native New Zealand. With `Return of the\nKing,' Jackson really gets a chance to show off. With, hands down, the\nmost\nbeautiful visuals of the trilogy, Jackson makes `Return of the King' a\ngorgeous feast for the eyes, while never resorting to McG level\nover-the-topness. Jackson stays very grounded in his characters, not\nletting\nthe effects tell the story, but only assist the wonderful dialogue and\ncharacters. Think of `Return' as a mix of `Fellowship' and `Two Towers,'\nwith enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event\nof this magnitude.<br><br>The bottom line, fans of the films will not be disappointed. Hardcore\nTolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by\nJackson and the other writers, however, it is unrealistic to expect a\ncompletely true adaptation of the novels, being that film is an entirely\ndifferent medium. Despite the alterations, Jackson consistently stays true\nto the major themes and ideas from the original text, while adding some of\nthe finest filmmaking ever put to screen. `The Lord of the Rings: The\nReturn\nof the King' is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect\nfilms\never made. Not only the best of the trilogy, but a crowning achievement in\nepic filmmaking.    \n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nI am, I admit, an unlikely convert to the religion of Tolkienism. I \r\nhave never read the books, having, I thought, been put off them for \r\nlife by the sort of obsessive freaks who read them when I was at \r\nschool. (One classmate, then aged about sixteen, told me with great \r\npride that he had read the whole of 'The Lord of the Rings' at least \r\nfifty times). I also have never been a great admirer of the 'sword and \r\nsorcery' school of fantasy writing or film-making; indeed, some of this \r\ngenre (mostly those starring the current governor of California) struck \r\nme as being among the worst films ever made.\r\n\r\nI was, however, persuaded to see the first in the trilogy, 'The \r\nFellowship of the Ring', by its overwhelmingly positive reception from \r\nthe critics, and was quickly won over by the scope of Peter Jackson's \r\nvision. I had been expecting some twee tale of elves, gnomes and \r\nfairies; what I experienced was a genuine epic (in the true sense of \r\nthat overused word). Ever since December 2001, I have been waiting for \r\nparts two and three of the trilogy to be released. Neither has \r\ndisappointed me.\r\n\r\nThe story of 'The Lord of the Rings' is too complex to be told in a \r\nreview such as this. Suffice it to say that it revolves around a magic \r\nring which will give its possessor immense power. The power-hungry Dark \r\nLord Sauron (a figure who is never actually seen on screen) desires to \r\nobtain the ring in order to dominate Middle Earth. His enemies, led by \r\nthe wizard Gandalf, are seeking to destroy the ring, which can only be \r\nused for evil purposes, not for good. At the beginning of the final \r\npart of the trilogy, Sauron's forces are massing for an attack on the \r\nkingdom of Gondor.\r\n\r\nThe film relates the story of the conflict which follows, and this \r\nleads to some of the most spectacular battle sequences I have seen, \r\neven more impressive than those in 'The Two Towers'. Inevitably, the \r\nfilm makes much use of computer-generated effects, but unlike many \r\nfilms dominated by special effects, plot and character are not \r\nneglected. The acting is uniformly good, and in some cases outstanding. \r\nSpecial mentions must also go to the camera-work, which made the best \r\npossible use of the magnificent New Zealand scenery, and to Howard \r\nShore's memorable musical score.\r\n\r\nSo, looking forward to the Oscar ceremony, I have no doubt that this \r\nshould be the best film and that Peter Jackson, who has amply fulfilled \r\nthe promise shown in the excellent 'Heavenly Creatures', should be best \r\ndirector. Best Actor? I would find it difficult to decide between the \r\ncompeting claims of Sir Ian McKellen, who brings wisdom, kindliness and \r\nthe required touch of steel to his portrait of Gandalf, and of Elijah \r\nWood, who plays the brave and resourceful hobbit Frodo to whom falls \r\nthe dangerous task of ensuring the ring's destruction. Best Supporting \r\nActor? My own nomination would be for Sean Astin, as Frodo's loyal \r\ncompanion Sam, but several others might have claims, notably Viggo \r\nMortensen or Bernard Hill.\r\n\r\nIs this the best movie ever made, as some of its admirers have claimed? \r\nPossibly not- that is, after all, a very large claim to make. I have no \r\ndoubt, however, that the trilogy as a whole is the first great \r\ncinematic masterpiece of the twenty-first century. It has certainly \r\ninspired me to start reading Tolkien's original novels. 10/10.\n</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nAs a movie watcher, I tend to become bored with the constant, overdone,\noverdrawn, underplayed, overdramatized performance and production quality\nof\nmost Hollywood films.

Such immense hype and professed genius only made the failure\nall\nthe more poignant for those of us that really wanted and expected more\nfrom\nthe franchise.<br><br>That all being said, I must say that The Lord of the Rings is an\namazingly\npowerful visual experience. Not even just a visual experience. Peter\nJackson\nhas crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into THE\nquintessential epic. He supplements the brilliant storytelling of JRR\nTolkien with one of the most awe-inspiring collection of films ever\ncreated.<br><br>The 7 hours of film that leads up to the Return of the King is only\nprecursor though, when you sit and watch this film. It's just plain\nbrilliance. Everything about the film is wonderful. The manner in which\nJackson has arranged the scenes, detracting slightly from the original\nflow\nof the novel really helps to keep the suspense strong in all three story\nbranches. The Tolkien humor is intact perfectly and the gallantry and\njust\nplain coolness of these heroes is plain amazing. (Check out Legolas in\nthe\nBIG battle) It's all just too much for words.<br><br>If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that\none\ncannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time\nhere. I personally believe that this is the only way such a film could be\nmade, true to the source material and completely engrossing, but I found\nmyself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional\nfinal\nminutes after 4 hours (including ads and previews) that I had spent in a\ncramped seat. As such, this will be all the better (at least for me) when\nit's release on DVD (can't wait for the extended...get to see the\nSauroman\nscenes that they cut out).<br><br>As a film though, this is amazing.

The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and\nsince it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a\nlittle more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.<br><br>At this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters,\nand the stakes have become tremendously high.

The tension was very high in this episode and I can\nhonestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the\nedge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites\nincluding the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic\nthat it is sure to stay for decades to come.<br><br>This is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that\nseems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo\ndid what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an\nincredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the\nbattle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad\nemptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the\nextended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over.

I'm\none of them.<br><br>Sorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I\nreally admire it.

Meanwhile the rest of the Fellowship prepare for\nanother battle to hold a human city against an onslaught of\norcs.<br><br>If you check my other reviews you will note that I wasn't a massive fan\nof\nthe first two films - I loved them, but was not blind to their faults.\nHowever, let me just lay my cards out here, I was totally blown away by\nthis\nfilm.  For the vast majority (and more of that later) the narrative\nflowed\nreally well where the other two films had struggled to really keep\nconsistent.  Here the various strands work well together and, while\ncharacters have only brief times to tell stories, on the whole it manages\nit\nwell.  I got the feeling that the film really let rip - it knew this was\nthe\nending and it did feel that everything came together in a collection of\nnoise and energy which really made it feel like the final part of a\ntrilogy\nrather than just a stand alone film.<br><br>The one area where the film really stutters (and actually caused people\nto\nleave the cinema in annoying numbers) is ironically the place where\nJackson\nis true to the book, and that's the final 20 minutes.  There is a clear\nscene where the film ends, however it then runs for another 20 minutes -\nwhich is a mix of scenes that all fade out like they were the end.  To\nJoe\nPublic (ie me!) I would have been happy not to have all the loose ends\ntied\nup in the way the book does it - the film should have ended on a high\n(with\nthe King being crowned etc) but instead it seems to crawl to an end in a\nway\nthat is not in line with the momentum of the film (if not the whole\ntrilogy!)  This problem is minor on the grand scheme of things, but I\nwould\nrather have left the cinema on my high than be made to wonder `when's\nthis\nending? Is this the end now? Oh, maybe this is it now?' - but I do\nunderstand why it was done this way.<br><br>The cast, as they have been all the way, are excellent.  Wood's Frodo\nchanges well during this film while Astin is touching in his portrayal of\nunerring friendship.  Bloom and Rhys-Davis had less to do but came into\ntheir own during the battle scenes - adding both action and the odd comic\ntouch (`that still counts as one' being accepted by the audience as a\nchance\nto break the tension).  Mortensen is the title character and serves it\nwell,\nwith McKellen also continuing his strong role.  I could list through the\nwhole cast but I will stick with noting two things.  Firstly, both\nMonaghan\nand Boyd had bigger and more meaningful roles and rose to them well.\nSecondly I continue with my belief from the second film that Serkis is\nthe\nstand out actor of the trilogy.  His Gollum is so much more than an\neffect -\nhe is tragic, fearsome, hateful and funny.  Praise of course goes to the\nspecial effects for making this character tell so much with an expression\nbut to pretend that the work of the actor is secondary to the character\n(as\nopposed the look) is foolish.  He deserved one for Two Towers so I hope\nan\nOscar goes his way.  It was a shame to not have screen time for Lee but\nthe\nfilm works well without him and it was a brave move by the\neditors.<br><br>The special effects do not stand out - and that's a compliment.  Even in\nstate of the art movies of late I have been aware that I could be\nwatching a\nvideo game.  Here I only occasionally noticed that things were clear\ncomputer effects, even though the majority of the film was!  This is how\nthey SHOULD be used - not as a draw in their own right but as part of the\nfilm.  Whether it be the massive battle scenes that are spectacular or\nthe\nanimated spider or just the fact that I forget that Gollum is only an\neffect, I cannot fault it's use of effects or the sheer visual feast that\nis\nthis film.<br><br>I have tried not to gush because there will be plenty of others to do\nthat\nwithout me joining them, but it is hard to really fault this film.  It is\nthe strongest of the trilogy and brings it all together really well, it\nis\nan emotional event more than a film and, if Jackson needs 20 minutes of\nslow\nclosure to finish it to his satisfaction then I can give him that in\nreturn\nfor all the hours of wonderful cinema that he has given\nme.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nThis is the final movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and certainly\ndoesn't disappoint like some other trilogies *coughMatrixcough*.

While there's a few\nlittle\nthings (a reversed shot with smoke flowing back into chimneys and\noccasional\nlighting that's a bit off), by and large they're excellent. The most\nimpressive thing about them is the sheer scale. This isn't a small or\nsimple\nscene; it often includes thousands of digital characters combined with\nfilmed actors and action, sweeping landscapes, and dozens of things\nhappening at once. This is a good reason to see it in theatres; even on\nDVD,\nthere's little details that you can only catch when it's on a massive\nscreen.<br><br>The filming is good, although there are a few evidences of digital\nsmoothing\nand cutting that can nag at the mind and eyes of a picky movie-goer.\nThere\nare a few interesting shots, but most are fairly plain and straight on,\ngetting the point across without being dazzling. New Zealand's landscapes\nprovide a great backdrop for everything going on, and there really are\nsome\nbeautiful places, especially up in the mountains. I hear land prices are\nquite good, what with the orcs warring and everything, so you may want to\nlook into real estate purchases now.<br><br>Sound has been said to make 75% of the emotional impact of any\nproduction.\nThis is a loud 75%. All the sound effects are very well pulled off, sound\nappropriate, and are generally loud. The Nazgul screeching was bordering\non\npainful, but in a good way. Most everything has a distinct sound, and\nit's\nrare that anything feels out of place. In some of the battles, the roof\nof\nthe theatre was shaking. The soundtrack fits the movie well, and Howard\nShore has done an excellent job, as with the last two films in the\nseries.<br><br>Performances all around were good, but Sean Astin as Sam and Viggo\nMortensen\nas Aragorn really dominated the film. They performed their roles\nperfectly,\nand came away giving a good picture of the characters. Elijah Wood seemed\nto\nbe stuck with the same terrified expression on his face through most of\nthe\nmovie, almost Max Payne-style, and it grew old quickly. Ian McKellen, the\never-wise white wizard, had a fair bit of dialogue which he delivered\nwell;\nmy only complaint is he had too much in the way of wistful sayings\nleading\nto scene changes. Orlando Bloom, favorite of young teenage girls\neverywhere,\nhad a few more action sequences (which got cheers from the aforementioned\ngirls) which were quite well pulled off, but his acting wasn't much\ntested\nby this film. John Rhys-Davies continued with Gimli's joking performance;\nhe's really too amusing to take seriously, but does a good job at\nit.<br><br>For the old Tolkien fans, this movie stays quite close to the book,\nalthough\nthey did have to omit some portions, most notably the taking and retaking\nof\nthe Shire and the time spent in the Halls of Healing in Minas Tirith.\nHopefully some of this will show up in the Extended Edition on DVD.\nShelob's\nattack was left until this film, and much of the time spent in Mordor was\nshortened for the sake of pacing, and it was a good decision.<br><br>My favorite scene would have to be the battle at Minas Tirith. The\nincredible scope of the battle, with the special effects, sounds, and\nmany\nclose-ups of pieces of the action, make for an exciting scene. The visual\neffects especially are stunning; the 'oliphaunts' play a big part in the\naction, and they're entirely created by computer. There's also some wide\nshots with tens of thousands of digital characters marching on the field\nof\nbattle, and even the individual actions have the masses warring as a\nbackdrop. It's worth your movie-going dollar simply to watch this on a\nlarge\nscreen. It was also intermingled with some smaller events inside Minas\nTirith, so it's not pure battle for the whole of the scene, and it keeps\nit\nfrom being dreary or heavy-handed.<br><br>Overall, this is a movie well worth watching, and even paying to see in a\ntheatre. I'd recommend against bringing small children, as there are some\nscary images, and they'd also be a distraction during the final movie in\nwhat will probably remain the series of the decade. Not a particularly\ngreat\ndate movie, either...this is a real, bring-your-friends big movie.

During the\nholiday season of 2003/4, I watched Return of the King four times.\nWhile I embraced ROTK as the third part of a dream come true, I was not\ntotally happy, left wondering why so many things vital were missing.\nThe 4-hour extended DVD version explains a lot.<br><br>My biggest beef was on so much missing about Aragon, and I found most\nof them in the DVD. One of the vital elements in the Fellowship's\nstrategy is to draw Sauron's eye away from Frodo, and here Aragon's\nrole is crucial. The ""last debate"" in the movie is totally inadequate\nin explaining the suicidal march to the Black gate but the DVD makes it\nvery clear, with the additional scene of Aragon revealing himself to\nSauron though the Palantir. He is the bait that Sauron cannot resist.<br><br>Another important aspect is that Aragon comes into the city of Minas\nTirith first and foremost as a HEALER, not as a king. The kingship\ncomes afterwards. This is again brought out in the additional scenes in\nthe DVD, although still missing a lot of details from the book.<br><br>Still disappointing, even for the DVD, is that so little is given to\nthe story of Eowyn and Faramir. The dialogue through which they come to\naccept each other could very well be the most beautiful in the entire\nbook. The few shots in the DVD that trace the development of their\nrelationship are far from adequate, although that's a least a slight\nimprovement from the film version.<br><br>Another disappointment is Aragon's arrival at the Pelennor Fields,\nwhich is hopelessly lame compared with the original treatment in the\nbook: amidst the despair of the Rohan and Gondor soldiers in witnessing\nthe approaching black ships, Aragon's standard suddenly unfurls at the\nmain mast: ""There flowered a White Tree, and that was for Gondor; but\nseven stars were about it, and a high crown above it, the signs of\nElendil that no lord had borne for years beyond count. And the stars\nflamed in the sunlight, for they were wrought of gems by Arwen daughter\nof Elrond; and the crown was bright in the morning, for it was wrought\nof mithril gold."" <br><br>The treatment of Gandalf's confrontation of the Witch King in the DVD\ndeparts from the book, in which the two are locked in a face off, then\nRohan's horns are heard and the Witch King swings around and leaves.\nWhat in heaven's name is in Peter Jackson's mind when he had Gandalf's\nstaff broken by the Witch King. But this did explain a mystery that has\nbeen bugging me for a year \x96 why Gandalf had to snatch a spear from the\nguard when he saved Faramir from the pyre of Denethor.<br><br>Enough on the DVD.I shall be remiss if I do not pay tribute to Peter\nJackson for the wonderful film he and his dedicated crew have created.<br><br>Most inspired is the lighting of the beacons to summon help from Rohan.\nIn the book, this is observed by Pippin in the ride to Minas Tirith. To\nsatisfy Pippin's curiosity, Gandalf explains the background to him in a\nsomewhat factual manner. Jackson turns this into one of the most\nexciting moments in the film, with aesthetically superb shots of the 13\nbeacons (yes, I counted them) being lit up in succession, accompanied\nby beautifully rousing music score, culminating in Theoden's heroic\nutterance of ""Rohan will answer"". Watching this has to be among the\nmost uplifting moments one can experience in a cinema.<br><br>Most poignant is the Faramir's suicidal attempt to retake Osgilaith,\nunder the orders of an unloving father. Starting from the soldiers of\nGondor filing out of Minas Tirith in what looks almost like a funeral\nmarch to the letting loose of the swarm of arrows by the orcs in\nOsgilaith, every image of this scene is so hauntingly heartrending. It\nreminds me of John Woo's favourite scenes, although here, the music is\nPipppin's actual singing rather than adapted background music,\nrendering the tragic mood even more devastating.<br><br>Directly opposite in mood is Rohan's charge in the Battle of Pelennor\nFields. Even if this mission is, in a way, equally suicidal, the spirit\nis sky high, radiating dauntless heroism and lust for battle. This\nscene also reminds me of the legendary battle scene in Spartacus (1960)\nwhich is universally recognised as the model in depiction of battle\nstrategies. Rohan's charge in Pelennor Field, no the other hand,\nexemplifies heroism unsurpassed.<br><br>Although ROTK is first and foremost the King's story, we should not\nforget, in the overall scheme of things, the ring bearers (no typo here\nbecause Frodo did acknowledge Sam as a fellow ring bearer in the end of\nthe book). Elijah Wood and Sean Astin (particularly Astin) have played\ntheir roles to perfection. Towards the end of the quest, when Frodo's\nstrength was almost fully spent, to hear Sam say ""I cannot carry it\n(the ring) for you, Mr. Frodo, but I can carry you"" and not be moved,\none will have to be a hopelessly and irreversibly hardened cynic. The\nbackground music, incidentally, is ""Into the west"".<br><br>It is certainly a good sign that the general audience worldwide has\nreacted favourably to the long aftermath following the destruction of\nthe ring, indicated that their capacity to appreciate has not been\nimpaired by the proliferation of Hollywood style slam-bang endings.\nViggo Mortensen's line to the Hobbits ""My friends, you bow to no one""\nis delivered with sincerity and conviction. The final scene at the Grey\nHavens is graceful, touching, stylish. However, there is one shot that\nI must mention: Galadriel's final enigmatic, alluring, half-smiling\nglance at Frodo before she disappears into the ship. Cate Blanchett is\namong the most versatile actresses around today and in LOTR, she is\nGaladriel incarnate.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nJust as Peter Jackson felt that LOTR had to be made as one large,\nthree-part, cinematic piece, I decided to write my IMDb review of all\nthree movies as a single, multi-part essay. Click on my screen-name and\nhit ""Chronological"" to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two\nTowers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my\nreview, but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and\nvery consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting,\ncinematography, art, and direction simply can not be beat.<br><br>Which of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood \x96 and the\nsame holds true for Tolkien's books. When I am immersed in the story,\nROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole\nexperience, I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense,\nevocative and thoughtful, I go for the Two Towers.<br><br>Frodo, Sam and Golem are on their way to Mount Doom and their bodies,\nnerves, and relationships have borne the greatest burden on middle\nearth. The rest of the fellowship is rallying to the defense of Minas\nTirith, and preparing for even more deadly battles to come.<br><br>The heroism and romance are incredibly moving - when was the last time\nyou saw an entire audience leaving a theater after a fantasy movie\nrubbing their eyes? The sets are breathtaking - even moreso than in the\nprevious two films.<br><br>The casting and acting are superb.<br><br>The film delivers at every level and is the jewel in the trilogy's\nwell-earned crown.<br><br>Return of the King offers a resolution of all of the major story arcs\nin LOTR. As with the classic Tolkien trilogy, however, you may be able\nto predict some of what will occur, but never all of it and you'll\nnever guess how you will get there. The same fatalistic and\nparadoxically unpredictable feeling of Tolkien's grand plots is present\nthroughout ROTK especially. The major theme in ROTK, however, is the\nvaried ways and means of heroism \x96 both intentional and unintended, and\nTolkien's examination of sacrifice and heroism is as inspiring as it is\nsubtle. Amazingly, it all comes through in the films.<br><br>Even more than the previous two films, Jackson and his writers took\nliberties with the story-line. Like the others, however, this serves\nthe film better than simple adaptation from one medium to another. By\nreordering some of the chronology and adding scenes and plot devices\nwhich are consistent with Tolkien's world and characterizations, the\nfilm-makers actually do a better job of preserving the concepts and\nthemes of the story than they could have with a pure adaptation. The\nlengthy epilogue in Tolkien's book is greatly reduced, reordered, and\nsomewhat changed in order to work in the film. Some parts actually\nappear very early in ROTK. And some aspects of Tolkien's epilogue are\ndisclosed in the Two Towers, though not directly depicted. But all of\nthe really important components of the epilogue are, at least strongly\nimplied if not well illustrated in ROTK.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><a href=""reviews-enter"">Add another review</a></p>>], [<bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nThousands of comments have been made on this outstanding production and\nthere is little left to write that has not already been written or said.\nAgain, not surprisingly at last night's 'Oscars', the third film in the\ntrilogy took most of the awards.\nLike others I could give glowing comments about content, acting,\nproduction,\ndirection, visual effects etc. but will instead, convey what I consider to\nbe equally important;  that is the realistic and accurate portrayal of a\nclassic masterpiece of literature from one of the world's most imaginative\nauthors. I have tried and failed three times to completely read the book\nand\nI enjoy reading, but feel that I could now do so and have a better\nunderstanding of the story - only because I know that Peter Jackson set\nout\nto retain accuracy of the story. Sometimes our own imagination lacks the\nability to see exactly what the author intended and if a film can help\nthat,\nthen it only adds to the experience. By timely coincidence as I write this\nmy computer screen saver has put up a picture of a mountain valley in New\nZealand - it must know what is in my mind. That beautiful country was\nperhaps the ideal setting for the film with its mystical landscape\npunctuated with mountain valleys, rivers, forests and open spaces. It\ncannot\nbe far from what may have been in Tolkien's own  mind.<br><br>I would perhaps add one comment about content. Although there was much\nreliance on computer visualisation it was well-balanced by emotional\nacting\nlike the characters Gollum and Gandalf. Although Gollum was a villain, I\nactually was made to feel sorry for him at the end. Too many potentially\ngood films are spoilt by substituting acting for over indulgence in\nspecial\neffects. This is an art that the producers and directors of this film had\nexactly right.<br><br>I hope that the success of this trilogy will herald a new era in\nfilm-making\nof classical stories. Our literature has a wealth of candidates, and even\nones that have been tried could be re-visited now that such experiences as\nLord of the Rings have proved financially viable and immensely popular.<br><br>\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is, hands down, among the\nmost spectacular and magnificent films of all time.<br><br>A short run-down of the plot: After the battle of Helm's Deep and\nSaruman's imprisonment in his tower Orthanc, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli\nand Gandalf re-group with Merry and Pippin in Isengard. There they\nlearn that the army of Sauron is planning a full-scale attack on the\nlargest city of men - Minas Tirith in Gondor. Gandalf and Pippin ride\nto Minas Tirith to warn Denethor, the steward of Gondor, of the threat\nfrom Mordor. Defenses are built up as the army of Sauron marches across\nthe Pelennor Fields towards Minas Tirith. A distress call is sent to\nRohan, still recovering from Helm's Deep. Rohan manage to muster a\nlarge army, and set out for Minas Tirith, but the battle has already\nbegun. In the meantime, we continue with Sam and Frodo on their quest\nto destroy the One Ring.<br><br>A major achievement of this epic film is the character development.\nGollum becomes more cunning and sneaky than ever, and manages to turn\nFrodo against Sam, who is desperately trying his best to get his old\nFrodo back. Merry and Pippin are no longer just a source of comic\nrelief, both of them prove themselves worthy as they are split up for\nthe final battle. We learn about the true bravery and potential of\nhobbits as Merry helps cut down the Witch King. Eowyn also proves\nherself in the film, as she defies her uncle and sets out to Pelennor\nfields with the other Rohirrim, and eventually destroys the Witch King,\nand makes a very feminist remark while doing so. We learn to loathe\nDenethor because of his hatred of his last remaining son, Faramir, who\nreally hasn't done anything wrong. The peak of our hatred for Denethor\nis reached in the scene where he tells Faramir that he would have\npreferred it if he had died instead of Boromir, his brother. And then,\nright after that, Denethor sends Faramir into certain suicide, and\nFaramir immediately accepts the mission he is appointed to, in a final\nattempt to please his father. And of course, Aragorn learns to accept\nhis fate as the true king of men.<br><br>In fact, the character development is so powerful that we actually\nparticipate in the character's feelings. We FEEL Frodo's exhaustion and\nagony as he literally drags himself across Mordor. We feel Sam's pain\nas Frodo is turned against him. And, just briefly, we participate in\nGollum's triumph as he finally gets the One Ring. We are actually happy\nfor Gollum and just for a brief moment, Frodo becomes the bad guy as he\ntries to take the ring back. All in all, Return of the King contains\nthe most moving, emotional and touching scenes in the entire trilogy,\nand some of the best acting, especially from Sean Astin (Sam), Elijah\nWood (Frodo), Ian McKellen (Gandalf), John Noble (Denethor, he is very\nsuccessful in adding depth to his character), Miranda Otto (Eowyn), and\nof course, Andy Serkis (Smeagol, and top-notch at it, just like in The\nTwo Towers).<br><br>The battle of Pelennor fields may be THE most spectacular and epic\nsequence in film history. Unlike Helm's Deep, Pelennor Fields shows the\ntrue cleverness of Sauron's army. Orcs are not the only participants;\ntrolls are heavily used in the battle, as warriors and as beasts of\nburden. The nazgul are very significant in the battle, and while the\nWitch King didn't actually lead the battle as he did in the book, the\nnine ringwraiths and their fell beasts still play a key part and do\nlots of damage in the battle. We see just how powerful the nazgul\nreally are. And of course, the men from the south and their massive\noliphaunts play a significant part. While in Helm's Deep we felt\ntriumphant, in Pelennor fields we only feel the triumph briefly, as the\nRohirrim make their charge into the horde of orcs and trolls. The\ntriumph in Pelennor Fields almost immediately dissolves, as the\nRohirrim are trampled down by the oliphaunts. The battle is won, but\nwe're not happy, we're grieved for all the destruction, all the losses.\nIt's a totally different feeling than Helm's Deep, and makes this\nbattle all the more superior.<br><br>Return of the King features the most magnificent visuals in the entire\ntrilogy. Whether they are of Minas Tirith, Pelennor Fields and\nOsgiliath, Mordor and the slopes of Mt. Doom or the climb to Shelob's\ncave near Minas Morgul, Peter Jackson really shows us the true impact\nof these landscapes and images.<br><br>Many people may complain about the changes in the movie, especially the\nsignificant cut of Saruman from the end, but you must realize that if\nthey would have featured the whole part with Saruman the movie would\nhave continued another hour and a half. Don't fret; Peter Jackson said\nthe scenes will all appear in the extended version of the film. The\nending is long enough as it is, and the film continues at least another\nhalf an hour after the Ring is no more. The hobbits return to the\nshire, and Sam marries Rosie. Aragorn meets his fate and is crowned\nking, and is finally reunited with Arwen. And of course, one of the\nmost moving scenes in the movie, in which Frodo gets on the last ship\nto the Undying lands with Bilbo, Gandalf, and the last of the elves\n(Galadriel and Elrond to name a few), and must part with his three\nhobbit friends for good.<br><br>All in all, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is one the\nmost fine-tuned, cinematically perfect films ever made, it's absolutely\nflawless in every aspect. The Lord of the Rings trilogy as a whole is a\nspectacular achievement in film making history, and all three movies\nare together, without a doubt, the greatest epic ever made.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nOverall, I am disappointed, though not surprised, by the negative\ncriticism of this movie. Indeed, this criticism exceeds the offering of\nalternative viewpoints and the expression of other cinematic\npossibilities and sinks into the realm of bitter invective. So many\narmchair critics are currently competing with avid Tolkien, Jackson,\nand movie fans alike in order to espouse the ""true"" value of Peter\nJackson's landmark movie trilogy. For it is a landmark event in cinema\nhistory based on its sheer size and careful attention, praise and\nevisceration apart. The issue that greatly irritates me and pushes me\nto write is that many of the negative reviewers on this website have\nsuch limited room in their imagination that they cannot conceive of a\nworld outside their own narrow framework. I find that a most sad\nreality in light of the legacy of Tolkien, Jackson, and all good\nstory-tellers -- to create, to engender, and to nourish the growth of\nany and all imaginative ventures.<br><br>The problem with imagination is that it is an individual event, a\nunique subjective experience that a single person experiences\ncompletely alone. Those who enter into the realm of Art, Fiction,\nFantasy, and any degree of Story-telling agree (willingly or no) to\ntake that personal act of creation and primal nature and share it with\nthe community of human beings, each of whom has his or her own\nimaginative context. It is a bold act of sacrifice, self-confidence,\nand faith (spiritual, one could argue) to thrust the contents of one's\nsubjective reality into (to borrow from Douglas Adams) the Whole Sort\nof General Mish Mash. People who do so deserve respect for the mere\ncreative act, the ability to foist forward what they believe is true.\nFrom Homer to Bill O'Reilly, this concept of personal creation, what\nTolkien called Sub-Creation, is the essence of modern human existence,\nand we owe it to each other to respect the right to creation history\nhas granted us.<br><br>Therefore, in defense of both Tolkien (whom some on this website have\nmaligned) and Jackson (whom many have maligned), I forward that both\nare imaginative creators in their own right, with different and\ncompletely acceptable offerings to the world. Those who cannot tolerate\neither for ""mediocre writing"" or ""atrocious film-making"" should offer\nforth their literary or cinematic offspring instead of cunningly-worded\ndiatribes of their deep dissatisfaction with all that does not conform\nto their inner reality. Then, we few who believe in and trust the\ncreative ability of all will be able to see how those critical inner\nrealities (so authoritative in exposition) match up with the rest of\nour perceptions.<br><br>Tolkien was an enormously talented, intelligent, and imaginative man,\none whose stories, though unpolished by experience, still managed to\nattract a worldwide audience and devoted following with their luster.\nJackson's movies took the sheen and inherent value of Tolkien's stories\nand placed it in a visual medium, a place where fans of LOTR could\nwitness and love the events and people they held so dear. Of course\nTolkien's story is imperfect; of course Jackson's movies aren't as full\nas we wish them to be. Their great successes are that they still manage\nto capture our imagination, to move us, to take genuine truth and\nisolate it in a world outside our ken, a place where we see ourselves\nbetter against a foreign backdrop. Both have created and done so\nmasterfully, with the intuitive grasp that is termed ""genius."" Tolkien\nwould have had much at issue with Jackson's movies, where plot\nincongruities, lapsed character development, and visual splendor\novershadow the philological and melancholic overtones of his book.\nJackson admits he finds much at issue with Tolkien's book, including a\nlack of clear character motivation, extended and largely extraneous\ndialog, and heightened language not suited for Hollywood. But Tolkien,\ndespite his perfectionist griping and loathing for any film version of\nhis book, would respect Jackson for continuing the act of creation, for\ntaking his modern-day mythology and spreading it to as many people as\npossible. Jackson has taken the beauty, the scope, the complexity, the\nrichness, and the loss that permeate Middle-Earth and shared those\nleitmotifs with the world. Tolkien's characteristic ""niggling"" would\nhave prevented any such attempt (even Jackson's), but in the end, his\nheritage lives on in beautifully conceived and executed films.<br><br>I do not ask others to stifle their opinions of this movie or any\nother. Indeed, continue to express the direst and bleakest of your\nfrustrations with the creative power of others, as it may lead you to\nactually do some creation yourself. Remember though, that the great\nevils of history, from Satan to Hitler to Sauron, are never capable of\ncreation -- only twisting, mutilating, mocking, deforming, and\nmisapplying. Be open to the vision of others and what they have to\noffer, especially when that offering comes in the virtuosic shape of\nTolkien's writing or Jackon's movies. Look for the True in the\nSecondary and how it manifests itself everywhere once you recognize it.<br><br>This movie receives a 10 from me because it not only maintains\nincredible faithfulness to Tolkien's themes (and yes, events may\ndeviate in completely separate and dissimilar media) but it asks\nintelligent viewers to look deeper into the circumstances of its own\ncreation and beauty. From the loyalty of Sam and the weight of epic\nhistory to the sacrifice of Arwen and the never-completely-won nature\nof war, Jackson's movies capture the essence and heart of Tolkien's\ntale, with the benefit of the director's own imaginative fruit as well.\nThe world owes Mr. Jackson its gratitude, as he has created another\nworld and another reality that so many can, do, and will cherish.<br><br>One final word: There are few who would not rather be wandering in a\nfar green country rather than dwelling in their own Circles of the\nWorld.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nIt takes a miracle for me to go the cinema since smoking is banned in\ncinema\nchains but Peter Jackson is a miracle worker .

He made me\nforget all about cigarettes for three hours with THE TWO TOWERS and I knew\nthat with RETURN OF THE KING he could make me forget all about ciggies for\na\nrecord breaking three and a half hours . I booked my ticket for Rothesay\nwinter gardens cinema and sat down to be enthralled<br><br>!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!<br><br>I do conclude there are some people in the world who can`t see what the\nfuss\nis about with the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy . My parents seem slightly\npuzzled that their cynical critical son loves LOTR . It`s simply explained\n,\nthese epic movies aren`t a childish fantasy , they`re like David Lean\nfilming a Shakespeare play , but I do take onboard the criticism that the\nstory structure of the movies can be irritating . FELLOWSHIP is very\nstop-start while the action intercutting in TTT can be annoying but ROTK\nhas\nprobably the best pace and structure of the three . ROTK starts with a\nsequence showing Smeagol murdering his friend in order to get the ring .\nThis gives some needed backstory to Gollum . It also sets up its stall\nthat\nit`s not a family film never mind a "" childish fantasy "" . In fact I\npredict\nthat many of the children in Rothesay cinema will be having nightmares\ntonight due to the scenes with that horrible big spider , it made my skin\ncrawl and the woman sitting next to me was gasping out loud as it prepared\nto cocoon poor Frodo , you should have seen the Q for the toilet after\nthat\nscene which tells you how convincing the FX are in this movie , nothing\nappears CGI : Gollum isn`t computer generated he`s a living being and\nPeter\nJackson doesn`t use camera trickery for fight scenes he uses million upon\nmillions of extras . He is David Lean reincarnated . No he is David Lean\nAND\nWill Shakespeare reincarnated , look at the way the cast act their parts ,\nit`s like they`re appearing in the greatest play of the bard . Their\nperformances are superlative<br><br>There are some flaws . I did mention the script gives background to\nSmeagol\nbut the script - Like the other films in the trilogy - is somewhat uneven\n.\nJohn Noble`s character Denethor seems somewhat underwritten and I wasn`t\nsure what his motivation was . Also as everyone else has mentioned the\nfalse\nendings are very irritating . When Aragorn is crowned king and the screen\nfaded to black the audience reached for their Jackets and bags then we`re\nshown another scene lasting several minutes which faded to a blaze of\nmusic. Everyone reached for their bags and jackets , then another scene\nwhich...\nIt would have been better to have seen Aragorn crowned King and then seen\nFrodo sailing into the distance but I guess after the screenwriters have\nirritated us with the abrupt endings of the first two movies it`s somewhat\ntraditional to irritate with the end of the trilogy . These faults I can\nforgive but there is an unforgivable cop out of having an army of the\nundead\ncharging to save the race of men from the Orc army at the end . It didn`t\nruin the movie for me but it just seems so lazy and contrived which\nstopped\nme from thinking it was the best movie in the trilogy , it`s not ,\nFELLOWSHIP is . But still this is a masterpiece of cinema which like\ncigarettes left me breathless and satisfied and hopefully we`ll see it\nsweep\nthe Oscar ceremony at last<br><br>As for the Oscars themselves I`m puzzled about a couple of things . Howard\nShore`s score is beautiful and haunting but it`s far from original with\nmuch\nof the music in ROTK re-used from FELLOWSHIP ( The Gondor theme ) and TTT\n(\nThe Celtic music ) while the omissions are even more surprising . No\nnominations for any of the actors ! I know that all the great performances\nwould cancel each other out but it`s shameful Andy Serkis wasn`t nominated\nas best supporting actor . Can anyone name a more unlikable baddie than\nGollum in recent cinema ? Me neither and no nomination for cinematography\n!\nI`ve no idea how John Lesnie`s camera was able to keep up with the action\nand he deserved at least a nomination so maybe we`ll see the third\ninstalment robbed on Oscar night like FELLOWSHIP was . Even if it is that\ndoesn`t stop me and millions of other film fans from recognising the\ngenuis\nof Peter Jackson .

After proving that this trilogy\ncan carry the weight of a truly enormous body of text with The\nFellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, Jackson has shown that\nnothing is impossible anymore when being brought to film, and that\nfantasy can be surreal, but grounded to reality.<br><br>I saw this film at 8:00 PM, and missed school the following day --\nexactly similar to The Two Towers when it was released. After seeing\nThe Return of the King I was speechless. Never before had a film made\nsuch an impact on me as this conclusion did, and now with it completed,\nThe Lord of the Rings is truly the best of the best.<br><br>Jackson has treated this trilogy as one film, following to Tolkien's\nlinear time-line, and not the way the books were written, which makes\nthis a film that flows and never loses track of pacing. The dialogue is\nemotional, be it the speech between Gandalf and Pippin before the gates\nof Minas Tirith, or inspirational, such as the rousing deliveries by\nTheoden and Aragorn. The vast emotion makes this a film for the ages.\nFollowing our heroes adventure since film one, we have grown compassion\nfor each and everyone of them. Sam's devotion to Frodo is something\nthat can inspire, and the eu-catastrophe is fully used here once again,\nbecause just as it seems that all hope has been lost, it shines through\nthe void and victory is achieved. If one were to fear that the ending\nwould feel like there was no closure, then have none, because The\nReturn of the King has a 20-minute denouement that goes as far as\nfour-years into the future, and the ending on the shores of the Grey\nHavens brought me to tears.<br><br>The special effects are nothing short of amazing. The blend of\nminiatures/bigatures and CGI is believable beyond comprehension, and\nthe addition of New Zealand locales adds something beyond some peoples'\nwildest dreams. The level of detail on Minas Tirith is something no one\nhas ever seen before, the massive armies sunder speakers as war erupts,\nand we see the Mumakil and the Fell Beasts in full fruition, as hinted\nin The Two Towers. What could've seem fatal, as cinematic history has\nshown before, is the introduction of Shelob the spider. The special\neffects team has created the most memorable spider in film history. She\nterrifies and drops jaws at the realism of such a beast.<br><br>The tension for the siege on Minas Tirith is so highly anticipated,\nthat the filmmakers have completely satisfied every expectation to how\nepic it could've been. The scope is just extraordinary. The battle of\nthe Pelennor Fields is so huge in the book, yet it has been fully\nrealized in Jackson's film. The final stand at the Black Gate is so\nemotional involving, it's hard to think that any action could top what\nwas previously seen, but it is done so with vision beyond imagination.<br><br>Howard Shore's music is also some of the most impressive and beautiful\norchestration ever done for film. Besting its predecessors, The Return\nof the King's score is pure genius. From the new theme for Gondor, to\nthe moving Into the West, Shore's composition sweeps and soars. Now\nthat each of the three films' complete recordings have been released, I\nstrongly urge a fan of the music to buy them, because they really are\nthe best of the best.<br><br>The acting even surpasses the first two, having the evolution of each\ncharacter add to the dramatic effect, be it the loss of a life, or the\ntriumph over evil. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn is like a Godsend. Sean\nAstin steals nearly every scene he is in as Sam, making us hope he\nhelps Frodo get rid of the Ring of Power. Once again, Andy Serkis\nprovides a stirring and great performance as Smeagol/Gollum. The full\nweight of the Ring is realized in this film, and Elijah Wood makes us\nsee his struggle like the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers\nonly hinted upon.<br><br>Overall, The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King is remarkable.\nThe battles are amazing, never making the film drag, and always\nheightening the tension. From the acting to the sound editing, this\nfilm delivers in what it promises, and that is the supreme motion\npicture of our lifetime, and many more years to come.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nThe journey comes to an end. For me the final installment ensures that the\nLord of the Rings replaces Star Wars as my favourite fantasy movie\nfranchise. In time the film will look dated, but the story and\ncharacterisation far surpass that of Star Wars. The Empire Strikes Back is\nthe only one of the Star Wars films that is in the same league as\nLOR.<br><br>As with Two Towers, the Return of the King doesn't recap the story so far,\nso don't even think of seeing this film if you're unfamiliar with the\nstory.\nIt starts with a flashback to Smeagol and means Andy Serkis gets to appear\non the finished print. Frodo, Sam and Smeagol then continue on their\nquest,\nwhilst the remaining members of the fellowship are briefly reunited at\nIsengard before taking different paths to Minas Tirith.<br><br>The action is unrelenting and most people will not notice the running time\nis over 3 hours. As with the previous films the combination of sets,\nmodels\nand cgi brings middle earth to life.<br><br>I suspect quite a few of the performers will be in with a chance of Oscar\nrecognition. Miranda Otto is the stand out performer and is outstanding as\nEowyn and surely deserves the Best Supporting Actress honour. I'm sure\nthat\nViggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, and Orlando Bloom\nwill all have their supporters for acting honours and rightly so, as they\nall put in fine performances. I'm not sure whether Andy Serkis is\nelligable,\nbut I suspect the success of Smeagol/Gollum owes as much to him as the\nanimators. Bernhard Hill should also be in with a shout for recognition\nfor\nhis performance as King Theoden. My guess is that it'll miss out on the\nacting awards with the exception of Miranda Otto. It's absolutely certain\nto\ntake Best Director, Best Picture and a string of technical awards though.\nMy\nguess is that it will be nominated for about 12 categories and take 8\ngongs.<br><br>Return of the King isn't flawless however. Saruman was cut entirely from\nthe\ntheatrical release of the film. We therefore missed out on the final face\noff between Gandalf and Saruman at Isengard. This was certainly filmed and\nwill no doubt be on the extended edition. When the Hobbits return to the\nShire it looks remarkably like when they left. No sign that Saruman has\narrived back before them and taken over. In the book Merry, Pippin, Sam\nand\nFrodo help rally the rest of the Hobbits to retake the Shire, but at some\ncost to both the hobbits and the environment. Merry, Pippin and Sam become\nheros to the rest of the hobbits who are largely unaware of Frodo's\nadventure and exploits. I'm not sure if any of this was shot, but it would\nbe a welcome addition to the extended addition. Personally I would have\nfollowed Tolkien and got rid of 7 minutes of Arwen footage and kept\nSaruman\nin. Bearing in mind Christopher Lee's passion for the trilogy it is also\nsad\nto see him removed from the final episode. I'm quite sure Peter Jackson\nmust\nhave had a few sleepless nights over that decision.<br><br>If Saruman's exclusion was the biggest blunder of the film, Gimli's\nconsignment to comic interlude was also a bit disappointing. I'm not\nagainst\na bit of light hearted relief every so often, especially in such a long\nfilm, but it seemed that every time Gimli appeared on screen it was for\nlight entertainment. The ""That still only counts as one"" line to Legolas\nwas\nvery funny though.<br><br>Despite these gripes Peter Jackson can certainly be very proud of the Lord\nof the Rings. Very few people thought it possible to do justice to the\nbook.\nHe has crafted a film that many people will enjoy for many years.\n\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nI admit it, I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say\nReturn of the King is the best of the trilogy, some may say it is the\nworst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and\nbetter exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still\ngreat Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.<br><br>My only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and\nbloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed.\nThat said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the\nway it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.<br><br>Despite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good\nand in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade.\nPeter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is\nmassive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are\nvery well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The\ncinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and\nmake-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don't distract\ntoo much and the lighting is authentic.<br><br>The score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal,\nrousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat\ndarker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and\nthe result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and\ncomplexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength\nand loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the\nfilm is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The\ncharacters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he\nis in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he\nappears in.<br><br>The acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet\nuncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but\ndo carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean\nAstin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and\nViggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is\nperfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy\nSerkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack\nof any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final\nresult.<br><br>All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nFellowship of the Ring was far and away the best of the three Lord of the\nRings movies, and the Academy snubbed it.  The Two Towers was far less\nimpressive, but that was understandable since the book of the Two Towers is\nthe weakest of the original trilogy, and Jackson saved one of its best\nepisodes, the confrontation between the hobbits and Shelob, for the third\nfilm.  The third film rebounds, as it ought to have given that the third\nbook is the best, but it does not reach the level reached by the first\nmovie, much less by the book.  Overall, Jackson did a good job, none of the\nmovies is bad, and he deserves recognition for his work and the risks he\ntook.  It's just hard not to feel disappointed, given the huge promise of\nthe first movie, to find that the trilogy as a whole is quite good but\nnowhere near great.<br><br>Certainly Jackson achieved a very impressive feat in constructing battle\nscenes that are even more exciting and terrifying than the excellent ones in\nthe previous two movies.  The assault of Grond on the gate of Minas Tirith,\nthe wild charge of the Rohirrim, the confrontation between Eowyn and the\nLord of the Nazgul, and the desperate clash with the Oliphaunts are probably\nthe finest fantasy warfare sequences ever filmed, managing to be intimate\nand detailed while also giving a sense of the overall strategic picture of\nthe battle.  Kurosawa would have been hard put to do better.<br><br>Too, Jackson pulled a major coup by constructing a version of the climactic\nscene at Mount Doom that will surprise the readers of the original book\nwithout disappointing them \x96 and it would have been very easy to go wrong at\nthis point.  And, Jackson manages a few times to do what he did with\nastonishing regularity in The Fellowship of the Ring: spot the dramatic\nmoments and give them even more impact on film than they have on the printed\npage.  His version of the scenes in the Paths of the Dead and the lighting\nof the beacons of Gondor are masterful.<br><br>But, Jackson has lost his eye for character; indeed, he has lost it so\ndisastrously that I have to wonder whether his master portraits of Boromir\nand Gandalf in the first film were anything more than luck.  This is\nclearest in his revolting representation of Denethor.  Jackson's Denethor is\na cretin: weak, craven, stupid, self-pitying, insensitive, spiteful, utterly\ndevoid of redeeming features.  No man cut from this cloth could have lasted\na month as Steward of Gondor, much less raised two of the boldest warriors\nof Minas Tirith or pitted his will against the Dark Lord Sauron for control\nof a Palantir.  The true story of Denethor, which Jackson misunderstood\ncompletely, is not of the crumbling of a coward, but what is infinitely more\ntragic, the crumbling of a brave man.<br><br>Meanwhile, Gandalf has receded into Old Testament prophet mode, and seems to\nhave no emotions of his own whatsoever.  Granted, even in the books Gandalf\nseems more distant and unapproachable after his reappearance, but he still\nhad the old irritability and humor underneath.  Arwen, after being used so\nwell in the first movie, again becomes an annoying hindrance to the plot. \nGimli, at least, has improved somewhat since The Two Towers; he is still\nbeing used as comic relief, but the humor is now more of a deliberately\nself-deprecating kind than the humiliating pratfall jokes he had to suffer\nthrough last time.<br><br>Also, I have to complain about some of the things that Jackson left out.  I\nwill concede that he was right to omit two of my favorite parts: the meeting\nwith Ghan-buri-Ghan and the Scouring of the Shire; time was limited, and\nsomething had to be cut.  (he could have omitted the Paths of the Dead too,\nif he'd had to, although that would have been a shame considering how well\nhe did that sequence).  But the confrontation between Gandalf and the\nWitch-King of Angmar at the ruins of the Gate could have been done in thirty\nseconds, and the parley with the Mouth of Sauron would have required less\nthan one minute to deliver one of the dramatic high points of the whole\nbook.<br><br>That Minas Tirith, Mount Doom, and the Grey Havens are magnificently done\nalmost goes without saying.  Art direction has been the one consistent\nstrong point throughout this whole trilogy.<br><br>In all, The Return of the King is a good movie.  Certainly far worse ones\nhave won Oscars.  I just hope that the award doesn't lead to people\nimagining that this is the best movie of the trilogy.<br><br>Rating: *** out of ****.<br><br>Recommendation:  Go see it on a big screen.  But watch The Fellowship of the\nRing first.\n\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nAll the threads of Tolkien's magnum opus come together in the most\nelegant of fashions in the final part of Peter Jackson's adaptation.\nHumanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through\nMordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and\nthe Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all\nhis might and fury.<br><br>""Return of the King"" is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic\nepic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely\ndramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter\nJackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his\nfavorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through\nunforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a\nmarvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be\nseen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The\nquieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight\nof the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.<br><br>The cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again\nJackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly\nmatch Tlolkien's creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their\nown usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of\nall the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen\nand David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his\nbrutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them\neven further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice\nemployed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring\nundertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too\nmany, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character\nwith the appropriate screen time and respect.<br><br>Now that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as\nit should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has\ntaken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and\nhave revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for\ncinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but\nthey make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to\nTolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for.<br><br>A masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own.

His parents, Bertha (Schorr) and Abraham Wallach, owned a candy store, Bertha\'s Candy Store. He went on to graduate with a B.A. from the University of Texas in Austin, but gained his dramatic training with the Actors Studio and the Neighborhood Playhouse. He made his debut on Broadway in 1945, and won a Tony Award in 1951 for portraying Alvaro Mangiacavallo in the Tennessee Williams play ""The Rose Tattoo"".Wallach made a strong screen debut in 1956 in the film version of the Tennessee Williams play Baby Doll (1956), shined as ""Dancer"", the nattily dressed hitman, in director Don Siegel\'s film-noir classic The Lineup (1958), and co-starred in the heist film Seven Thieves (1960). Director John Sturges then cast Wallach as vicious Mexican bandit Calvera in The Magnificent Seven (1960), the western adaptation of the Akira Kurosawa epic Shichinin no samurai (1954). By all reports, Wallach could not ride a horse prior to making ""TMS"", but expert tutelage from the film\'s Mexican stunt riders made it look easy! He next appeared in the superb The Misfits (1961), in the star-spangled western opus How the West Was Won (1962), the underrated WW2 film The Victors (1963), as a kidnapper in The Moon-Spinners (1964), in the sea epic Lord Jim (1965) and in the romantic comedy How to Steal a Million (1966).Looking for a third lead actor in the final episode of the ""Dollars Trilogy"", Italian director Sergio Leone cast the versatile Wallach as the lying, two-faced, money-hungry (but somehow lovable) bandit ""Tuco"" in the spectacular Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966) (aka ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly""), arguably his most memorable performance. Wallach kept busy throughout the remainder of the \'60s and into the \'70s with good roles in Mackenna\'s Gold (1969), Cinderella Liberty (1973), Crazy Joe (1974), The Deep (1977) and as Steve McQueen\'s bail buddy in The Hunter (1980).The 1980s was an interesting period for Wallach, as he was regularly cast as an aging doctor, a Mafia figure or an over-the-hill hitman, such as in The Executioner\'s Song (1982), Our Family Honor (1985), Tough Guys (1986), Nuts (1987), The Two Jakes (1990) and as the candy-addicted ""Don Altabello"" in The Godfather: Part III (1990). At 75+ years of age, Wallach\'s quality of work was still first class and into the 1990s and beyond, he has remained in demand. He lent fine support to Vendetta: Secrets of a Mafia Bride (1990), Teamster Boss: The Jackie Presser Story (1992), Naked City: Justice with a Bullet (1998) and Keeping the Faith (2000). Most recently Wallach showed up as a fast-talking liquor store owner in Mystic River (2003) and in the comedic drama King of the Corner (2004).In early 2005, Eli Wallach released his much anticipated autobiography, ""The Good, The Bad And Me: In My Anecdotage"", an enjoyable reading from one of the screen\'s most inventive and enduring actors.Eli Wallach was very much a family man who remained married to his wife Anne Jackson for 66 years. When Wallach died at 98, in 2014, in Manhattan, NY, he was survived by his wife, three children, five grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       firehouse44@hotmail.com          Spouse (1) Anne Jackson (5 March\xa01948            - 24 June\xa02014)\xa0(his death)\xa0(3 children)          Trade Mark (1)        Raspy gravelly voiceTrivia (31)      Received his Bachelor\'s degree from the University of Texas at Austin in 1936.      Was almost killed during the train scene in Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966). He was asked by Sergio Leone to do the scene again, and he then replied: ""I\'ll never do that again!"".      Turned down the role in From Here to Eternity (1953) that won Frank Sinatra an Oscar.      Is one of three actors to play the character of Mr. Freeze on Batman (1966) (The other two were George Sanders and Otto Preminger). He once said that he has received more fan mail for that role than for any other role he has ever done.      Father, with Anne Jackson, of son Peter Wallach, and daughters Katherine Wallach and Roberta Wallach.      Was named as ""King of Brooklyn"" at the Welcome Back to Brooklyn Festival in 1998. His wife Anne Jackson was named ""Queen of Brooklyn"" at the same festival.      Had appeared with Steve McQueen in both McQueen\'s first major successful film (The Magnificent Seven (1960)) and in his last film (The Hunter (1980).      One of his best known roles was the lead bandit Calvera in The Magnificent Seven (1960). Although his character was eventually defeated in the film, Wallach outlived six of the other seven stars, as Robert Vaughn is the only one who is still alive as of 2014, in spite the fact that he was older than all of them.      He, his wife Anne Jackson and their daughter, Roberta Wallach, all made guest appearances in different episodes of Law & Order (1990).      Had appeared with Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable and Steve McQueen in their final completed films: The Misfits (1961) (for both Monroe and Gable) and The Hunter (1980) respectively.      He had a brother and two sisters, all of whom became teachers.      He served for five years in the Army\'s Medical Administrative Corps during World War II, eventually attaining the rank of captain.      He had five grandchildren.      There was no official theater department at the University of Texas when he attended, so he joined a student organization called The Curtain Club to put on plays. One of the other students involved was future Governor of Texas John Connally.      In his later years, he was blind in the left eye due to a stroke.      While attending the University of Texas, he acted in many student plays. In one, he performed with fellow students Ann Sheridan and Walter Cronkite.      He had two hip replacements and had arthritis in his back.      One of his fellow students at Parsons New School for Social Research in New York was Marlon Brando.      Turned down the lead role of Harry Berlin in Luv (1967) that was eventually played by Jack Lemmon.      In an interview on ""Fresh Air"" (at station WHYY in Philadephia, Pennsylvania, broadcast nationally on National Public Radio), he explained to Terry Gross that he learned to ride horses at the University of Texas: He took care of the polo ponies. During the filming of the The Magnificent Seven (1960), each morning he would ride a few hours with his gang.      He was friends with Walter Cronkite for over 70 years since they were both students at the University of Texas at Austin. Wallach was acknowledged at the Walter Cronkite memorial tribute at Lincoln Center and was in the audience.      Had appeared with his wife Anne Jackson in six films: The Tiger Makes Out (1967), How to Save a Marriage and Ruin Your Life (1968), Zig Zag (1970), The Angel Levine (1970), Nasty Habits (1977) and Sam\'s Son (1984).      Was the reader of the audio-book of Stephen King\'s novel ""Insomnia"".      He died from natural causes at his home in Manhattan, New York City.      He grew up in the only Jewish family in an otherwise all-Italian neighborhood, and gained fame from starring in an Italian Western. Appropriately enough, the name ""Wallach"" derives from the same Old German root word for which the Polish name for Italy, Wlochy, comes from.      After failing the New York teachers\' exam, Wallach got a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse and spent two years there before graduating in 1940. Among his classmates were Gregory Peck, Lorne Greene, and Tony Randall.      Wallach played Sakini for a year in the London cast of ""Teahouse of the August Moon."" Among the aspiring young actors from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts who worked backstage with scenery were Alan Bates, Peter O\'Toole, and Albert Finney. Wallach later succeeded David Wayne in the part in the Broadway production.      Served five years in the Army Medical Corps during World War II eventually reaching the rank of major.      Made his Broadway debut in the service-oriented drama ""Skydrift"" directed by Roy Hargrave, who had coincidently directed Anne Jackson, Wallach\'s future wife, in her Broadway debut in ""Signature"" a few months earlier.      ""Time"" magazine once referred to Eli Wallach and wife Anne Jackson as ""the proletarian Lunts."".      Although he is best known for playing Mexican characters in westerns, Wallach was actually a Polish Jew in real life and had no Hispanic ancestry.Personal Quotes (37)      The subtitle [of his memoir ""The Good, the Bad and Me""] is ""In My Anecdotage"". Bill Clinton asked me if he could use it, and I said, ""You sold two million copies of your book. How dare you try to steal my subtitle!"".      I was at the premiere of The Holiday (2006), a movie I did with Kate Winslet. Surrounded by all these beautiful young women. And after they left, [wife Anne Jackson] comes up and says to me, ""Honestly, I don\'t know what they see in you."".      Well, I go to the theater today, and its curtain - there is no curtain in this play; the lights go down and go up - and we start. And I live this character for two hours. There are only two of us in the play. And It\'s a complete experience.      I never lost my appetite for acting.      Having the critics praise you is like having the hangman say you\'ve got a pretty neck.      I\'ve learned that life is very tricky business: Each person needs to find what they want to do in life and not be dissuaded when people question them.      But Clint [Eastwood] I love, because Clint was my mentor. I knew nothing about making an Italian movie.      When you have to shoot, shoot, don\'t talk.      When I saw the movie, I said, ""I wish I had heard the music. I would have ridden the horse differently."".      I\'ve never lost my appetite for acting; it\'s innovative and challenging.      And that movie was underrated - Nuts (1987) - because it deals with a terrible subject, but It\'s very well done.      And I did Batman (1966), too. I did Mr. Freeze. I get more mail for him than anything I\'ve ever done.      Even if I don\'t want to slow down, I\'m slowing down.      But I went to the University of Texas in the 30s, and while there I learned to ride. Mostly polo ponies.      And then the first was The Misfits (1961), which I enjoyed very much, with Marilyn and Gable.      Everyone thinks acting is easy. It\'s far from easy, but it\'s the most gratifying thing I do.      I love to tell stories and this is my way of getting them down on paper.      I always end up being the evil one, and I wouldn\'t hurt a fly.      I never dreamed I would do Westerns.      I was an original member of the Actors\' Studio.      I always wanted to tell stories and act.      The big secret in acting is listening to people.      I\'ve worked with wonderful actors like Marlon Brando and Henry Fonda.      One thing changes every evening: It\'s the audience, and I\'m working my magic. I\'m always learning from it.      The trouble with that movie is that you had to see Chinatown (1974) the day before you saw The Two Jakes (1990).      What is it in my makeup that makes me grab any offer and fly around the world? Will I ever be satisfied? Can\'t I ever just rest?      I met my wife and, for the next ten years, we did no films at all. She did the first movie and then I did several after. My first movie was written by Tennessee Williams and directed by [Elia] Kazan and was called Baby Doll (1956).      This country has a complex about age. It\'s unbelievable. If you\'re over thirty, you\'ve had it in this country.      Well, I\'ve maybe gotten 200 requests for interviews about Marilyn, and I just decided I\'m gonna do my own.      Yes, I won the BAFTA. I thought the British were very intelligent.      Well, I was getting a lot of money then, and I wasn\'t getting any Hollywood films, so I just did those. I\'d always do a play in between. Whenever I ran low on funds, I\'d always rush off to do a movie somewhere.      My wife says that stage acting is like being on a tightrope with no net, and being in the movies, there is a net - because you stop and go over it again. It\'s very technical and mechanical. On stage you\'re on your own.      So I wanted to show what I did with the money. So I got red silk shirts, beautiful hats, wonderful saddles, a great horse, and two gold teeth. So that was the way I did it.      I\'d come out of the Army after five years as a medic. I was a medical administrator and we ran hospitals, and I was a Captain in the Army at the end, in 1945.      I don\'t act to live. I live to act.John Huston was a superb master. He knew how to make good films. I did three things with him. One is called Independence (1976). It plays in Philadelphia, for free. It\'s been playing there for 25 years.      [on directing in 1983] I simply don\'t have the temperament or the patience. I once tried to direct a play, and everyone emerged like me. A good director is like a nursemaid, a guide, a psychologist, a friend, one who leaves you room to stretch and grow. I don\'t have the patience for that, so I don\'t try. Dustin did it in a movie and directed a play of Murray\'s -- and did it very well.

Born May 31, 1930 in San Francisco, the elder of two children in a middle-class family, Eastwood stayed in high school until the comparatively late age of nineteen and worked menial jobs over a period of several years before enrolling at Los Angeles City College, from which he dropped out after two semesters to pursue acting. He found uncredited bit parts in such nondescript B-films as Revenge of the Creature (1955) and Tarantula (1955) during the mid-\'50s while simultaneously digging swimming pools for a living, until he got his first breakthrough in the long-running TV series Rawhide (1959) with Eric Fleming. Though only a secondary player in the early seasons, Clint made the show his own by end of its run and became a recognizable face to television viewers around the country.Eastwood found much bigger and better things in Italy with the excellent spaghetti westerns Per un pugno di dollari (1964) and Per qualche dollaro in pi\xf9 (1965). But it was the third installment in the trilogy where he found one of his signature roles: Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966). The movie was released in America in early 1968 and made Clint an international star. His first U.S.-made western, Hang \'Em High (1968), was yet again a success, and he followed it up with another starring role in Coogan\'s Bluff (1968) (the loose inspiration to the TV series McCloud (1970)) before playing second fiddle to Richard Burton in the World War II epic Where Eagles Dare (1968) and Lee Marvin in the bizarre musical Paint Your Wagon (1969). In Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970) and Kelly\'s Heroes (1970), Eastwood went in an experimental direction by combining tough-guy action with offbeat humor.1971 proved to be one of his best years in film, if not the best. He starred in The Beguiled (1971) and the classic thriller Play Misty for Me (1971), but it was his role as the hard edge police inspector in Dirty Harry (1971) that gave Eastwood one of his signature roles and invented the loose-cannon cop genre that has been imitated even to this day. Eastwood did a fairly consistent quality of work thereafter with the road movies Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974) and The Gauntlet (1977), the Dirty Harry sequels Magnum Force (1973) and The Enforcer (1976), the westerns Joe Kidd (1972), High Plains Drifter (1973) and The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) (his first of six onscreen collaborations with then live-in love Sondra Locke), and the fact-based thriller Escape from Alcatraz (1979). In 1978 he branched out into the comedy genre in Every Which Way But Loose (1978), which became the biggest hit of his career up to that time; taking inflation into account, it still is. In short, notwithstanding The Eiger Sanction (1975), the \'70s were an uninterrupted continuation of success.Eastwood kicked off the \'80s with Any Which Way You Can (1980), the blockbuster sequel to Every Which Way But Loose. The fourth Dirty Harry film, Sudden Impact (1983), was the highest-grossing film of the franchise and spawned the character\'s trademark catchphrase, ""Make my day"". Clint also starred in Bronco Billy (1980), Firefox (1982), Tightrope (1984), City Heat (1984), Pale Rider (1985) and Heartbreak Ridge (1986), all of which were solid hits, with Honkytonk Man (1982) being his only commercial failure of the period. In 1988 he did his fifth and final Dirty Harry movie, The Dead Pool (1988). Although it was a success overall, it did not have the box office punch the previous films had. About this time, with outright bombs like Pink Cadillac (1989) and The Rookie (1990), it became apparent that Eastwood\'s star was declining as it never had before. He then started taking on more personal projects, such as directing Bird (1988), a biopic of Charlie Parker, and starring in and directing White Hunter Black Heart (1990), an uneven, loose biopic of John Huston.Eastwood bounced back in a big way with his western Unforgiven (1992), which garnered the then 62-year-old his first ever Academy Award nomination (Best Actor) and win for Best Director. Following up with a quick hit, he took on the secret service in In the Line of Fire (1993), then accepted second billing to Kevin Costner in the interesting but poorly received drama A Perfect World (1993). Next up was a love story, The Bridges of Madison County (1995), where Clint surprised audiences with a sensitive performance, but it soon became apparent he was going backwards after his brief revival. Subsequent films were credible, but nothing really stuck out. Among them were the moderately well-received Absolute Power (1997) and Space Cowboys (2000) as well as the badly received True Crime (1999) and Blood Work (2002). But Eastwood surprised yet again, returning to the top of the A-list with the hugely successful boxing drama Million Dollar Baby (2004). The movie earned him an Oscar for Best Director and a Best Actor nomination for the second time. Behind the camera, he had big successes directing the multi-award-winners Mystic River (2003), Flags of Our Fathers (2006), Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) and Changeling (2008) which starred Angelina Jolie. His next starring vehicle, Gran Torino (2008), earned $30 million in its opening weekend, proving his box office appeal has not waned.Eastwood has managed to keep his extremely convoluted personal life top secret and never discusses his families with the media. He had a long time relationship with frequent co-star Locke and has at least eight children by at least six other women, although he has only been married twice. Clint Eastwood lives in Los Angeles and owns homes in Monterey, Northern California, Idaho and Hawaii.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Scott- msa0510@mail.ecu.edu          Spouse (2) Dina Eastwood (31 March\xa01996            - 22 December\xa02014)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(1 child)                         Margaret (Maggie) Neville Johnson          (19 December\xa01953            - 19 November\xa01984)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(2 children)          Trade Mark (16)        During the credits at the end of his movies, the camera will move around the location it was filmed in, after which there will be freezeframe for the rest of the credits.        Frequently uses shadow lightning in his films        Known on-set as a director for filming very few takes and having an easy shooting schedule. Tim Robbins once said that when working on Mystic River, Eastwood would usually ask for only one take, or two ""if you were lucky"", and that a day of filming would consist of starting ""no earlier than 9 a.m. and you leave, usually, after lunch.""

Owns the Mission Ranch hotel & restaurant in Carmel, Calif., the exclusive Tehama golf club in Carmel Valley, and is partial owner of the Pebble Beach Golf Country Club in nearby Monterey Peninsula.      Received an honorary Cesar award in Paris, France for his body of work. [February 1998]      Ranked #2 in Empire (UK) magazine\'s ""The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time"" list. [October 1997]      Gained popularity with his first three major films, Per un pugno di dollari (1964), Per qualche dollaro in pi\xf9 (1965) and Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966) (which weren\'t released in America until 1967/68). Soon afterwards Jolly Films (which produced Per un pugno di dollari (1964)) came out with a film called ""The Magnificent Stranger"", which was actually two episodes of Rawhide (1959) edited together. Eastwood sued and the film was withdrawn.      He wore the same sarape, without ever having washed it, in all three of his ""Man with No Name"" Westerns.      Elected mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. It has often been claimed that Eastwood ran for office as a Republican. In fact, although he was registered as a Republican in California, the position of mayor is non-partisan. [April 1986]      Was apparently such an organized director that he finished Absolute Power (1997) days ahead of schedule.      Got his role in Rawhide (1959) while visiting a friend at the CBS lot when a studio exec spotted him because he ""looked like a cowboy.""      Lifeguard and projectionist of training films for the U.S. Army from 1951-1952, stationed at Fort Ord in California. According to former high school buddy Don Loomis in ""Clint: The Life and Legend"" by Patrick McGilligan, page 49, Eastwood avoided being sent to combat in Korea by romancing one of the daughters of a Fort Ord officer, who might have been entreated to watch out for him when names came up for postings.      Has at least eight children by at least six different women: Kimber Eastwood (b. June 17, 1964) with Roxanne Tunis; Kyle Eastwood (b. May 19, 1968) and Alison Eastwood (b. May 22, 1972) with Maggie Johnson; Scott Eastwood (b. March 21, 1986) and Kathryn Eastwood (b. February 2, 1988) with Jacelyn Reeves; Francesca Eastwood (b. August 7, 1993) with Frances Fisher; Morgan Eastwood (b. December 12, 1996) with Dina Eastwood; and at least one other child with at least one other woman whose identities are not confirmed. Only Kyle, Alison, Francesca and Morgan are mentioned in Clint\'s farcical episode of Biography (1987) which aired in October 2003.      It\'s interesting, given his penchant towards violence, that his name, Clint Eastwood, is an anagram for \'old west action\'.      His name is used as the title of the hit Gorillaz song and video ""Clint Eastwood"" (2001).      Mentioned in the theme song of the 1980s TV hit The Fall Guy (1981).      Until his pride was displaced by discovery of a larger version of same tree in 2002, Eastwood used to be proud owner of tree believed to be the nation\'s largest known hardwood - a bluegum eucalyptus.      Sworn in as parks commissioner for state of California at Big Basin Redwood Park, Santa Cruz, Ca., 8 June 2002. Holding up his new commissioner\'s badge, he told the crowd, ""You\'re all under arrest"".      2000 recipient of John F. Kennedy Center Honors.      Received the Career Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. [August 2000]      Of English, Scottish, Irish, and smaller amounts of German, Dutch, and Welsh, ancestry.      His character\'s voice was provided by Enrico Maria Salerno in Per un pugno di dollari (1964), Per qualche dollaro in pi\xf9 (1965) and Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966). In 1967, Eastwood dubbed his dialogue in English for the trilogy\'s American release.      When he directs, he insists that his actors wear as little makeup as possible and he likes to print first takes. As a result, his films consistently finish on schedule and on budget.      When directing, he simply says ""okay"" instead of ""action"" and ""cut."" (source: ""Sunday Morning Shootout"").      Weighed 11 lbs 6 oz at birth.      His production company is Malpaso Productions, which he formed in 1968. The company\'s first feature release was Hang \'Em High (1968).      Mentioned on T.G. Sheppard\'s hit single ""Make My Day,"" which in the first half of 1984 reached #12 on Billboard\'s Hot Country Singles chart and also reached #62 on that magazine\'s Hot 100 singles survey.      When Don Siegel fell ill during production of Dirty Harry (1971), Eastwood stepped in as director during the attempted-suicide/jumper sequence.      Current wife Dina Ruiz (Dina Eastwood) is a former local television news anchor/reporter from Salinas, California. They met when she was assigned to interview him for KSBW-TV in April 1993. She admitted that she had seen zero of his movies.      Is 35 years older than wife Dina Eastwood. Dina\'s parents were 19 and 21 when she was born. This makes Clint 16 years older than his mother-in-law, and 14 years older than his father-in-law.      Brother-in-law of Dominic V. Ruiz and Jade Marx-Berti.      After fathering a child with Roxanne Tunis in 1964, he asked then wife Maggie Johnson for a divorce, but within a matter of weeks, Johnson became very ill with hepatitis. She and Eastwood reconciled, coming to a mutual agreement that it would be best if she turned a blind eye to the other family. In 1968, almost 15 years after they married, their first child together was born.      Eastwood\'s two children from liaisons with Jacelyn Reeves were born with their mother\'s last name and prior to 2006 were left out of virtually all publications about Eastwood. No father is listed on either of their birth certificates.      He has always disliked the reading of political and social agendas in his films, which has occurred from Dirty Harry (1971) to Million Dollar Baby (2004). He has always maintained that all of his films are apolitical and what he has in mind when making a film is whether it\'s going to be entertaining and compelling.      Has been named to Quigley Publications\' annual Top 10 Poll of Money-Making Stars 21 times, making him #2 all-time for appearances in the top 10 list. Only John Wayne, with 25 appearances in the Top 10, has more. Eastwood, who first appeared in the Top Ten at #5 in 1968, finished #2 to Wayne at the box office in 1971 after finishing #2 to Paul Newman in 1970. After his first two consecutive #1 appearances in 1972 and 1973, he dropped back to #2 in 1974, trailing Robert Redford at the box office. Clint was again #2 in 1979, 1981 and 1982 (topped by Burt Reynolds all three years), before leading the charts in 1983 and \'84. He last topped the poll in 1993.      Was named the top box-office star of 1972 and again in 1973 by the Motion Picture Herald, based on an annual poll of exhibitors as to the drawing power of movie stars at the box-office, conducted by Quigley Publications.      He was the only nominee for the Best Actor Oscar in 2004 (for Million Dollar Baby (2004)) to play a fictitious character. All four other nominees portrayed real people in their respective films.      A sample of his whistling can be heard on the track ""Big Noise"" from his son Kyle Eastwood\'s jazz CD ""Paris Blue"" (2004).      At The 45th Annual Academy Awards (1973), he presented the 1972 Best Picture Oscar to Albert S. Ruddy, the producer of The Godfather (1972). Thirty-two years later they would jointly accept the 2004 Best Picture Oscar at the The 77th Annual Academy Awards (2005), along with fellow Million Dollar Baby (2004) co-producer Tom Rosenberg.      At The 72nd Annual Academy Awards (2000) he presented the Best Picture statuette to American Beauty (1999).      Was named the #1 top money-making star at the box office in Quigley Publications\' annual poll of movie exhibitors five times between 1972 and 1993. Bing Crosby, Burt Reynolds and Tom Hanks also have been named #1 five times, while Tom Cruise holds the record for being named #1 six times.Stacy McLaughlin filed a $100,000 lawsuit against Eastwood in May 1989 for ""knowingly, intentionally and deliberately"" ramming her Nissan Maxima with his quarter-ton pickup at the Burbank Studios on Dec. 16, 1988, when she mistakenly parked in his parking space while dropping off a tape at his Malpaso Productions office. Eastwood, who contended he was only trying to park his vehicle in its rightful space, paid $960 to repair the headlights and bumper of McLaughlin\'s car. She sought the additional money as punitive damages, claiming malice on Eastwood\'s part. The case went to court in July 1991, but a judge refused to grant the damages.      At age 74, he became the oldest person to win the Best Director Oscar for Million Dollar Baby (2004).      He directed 11 different actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Gene Hackman, Meryl Streep, Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Marcia Gay Harden, Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, Angelina Jolie, Matt Damon, Bradley Cooper, and himself (in Unforgiven (1992) and Million Dollar Baby (2004)). Hackman, Penn, Robbins, Freeman and Swank won Oscars for their performances in one of Eastwood\'s movies.      For two consecutive years he directed two out of the four actors who won Oscars for their performances: Sean Penn (Best Actor) and Tim Robbins (Best Supporting Actor) in Mystic River (2003)) in 2004, and Hilary Swank (Best Actress) and Morgan Freeman (Best Supporting Actor) for Million Dollar Baby (2004)) in 2005.      Received an honorary Doctorate from Wesleyan University in Connecticut (2000). Wesleyan is also home to his personal archives.      Every year the PGA tour comes to Pebble Beach, California, to host a celebrity golf tournament where celebrities team up with the professionals. Clint participated in this every year from 1962-2002 and is the longest running participant. He now serves as Host.      In early 2005 he announced that he would supply the voice for a ""Dirty Harry"" video game.      Premiere Magazine ranked him as #43 on a list of the Greatest Movie Stars of All Time in their Stars in Our Constellation feature (2005).      Favorite actor is James Cagney.      Some of his favorite movies are The 39 Steps (1935), How Green Was My Valley (1941), Sergeant York (1941), The Ox-Bow Incident (1943) and Chariots of Fire (1981).      Some of his favorite actors are Gary Cooper, Humphrey Bogart, Robert Mitchum and James Stewart.      Became so fond of British pubs and beer during his time in London filming Where Eagles Dare (1968) that he opened the Hog\'s Breath Inn with co-founders Paul E. Lippman and Walter Becker in 1972. According to Lippman, ""I had to terminate three pretty good waitresses in the first few months of operation; not because they went to bed with Clint Eastwood, but because they either talked about it all over the premises, or came in the next day acting like they owned the place."" The restaurant closed in 1999 and then re-opened under new management.      Has his look-alike puppet in the French show Les guignols de l\'info (1988).      He stood at 6\'4"" at his peak, but due to recent back problems, he can only stretch up to 6\'2"".      He, Warren Beatty, Robert Redford, Mel Gibson, Richard Attenborough and Kevin Costner are the only directors best known as actors who have won an Academy Award as Best Director.      President of jury at the Cannes Film Festival. [1994]      Claimed that the trait he most despised in others was racism.      The boots that he wore in Unforgiven (1992) are the same ones he wore in the TV series Rawhide (1959). They are now a part of his private collection and were on loan to the 2005 Sergio Leone exhibit at the Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage in Los Angeles, California. In essence these boots have book-ended his career in the Western genre.      Made six movies with former partner Sondra Locke: The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), The Gauntlet (1977), Every Which Way But Loose (1978), Bronco Billy (1980), Any Which Way You Can (1980) and Sudden Impact (1983).      As a director, he has always refused to test screen his films before their release.      He objected to the end of Dirty Harry (1971) when Harry throws his badge away after killing the Scorpio Killer, arguing with director Don Siegel that Harry knew that being a policeman was the only work for which he was suited. Siegel eventually convinced Eastwood that Harry threw his badge away as a symbol that he had lost faith in the justice system.      He was a contract player at Universal International in the mid-1950s. He and a younger actor named Burt Reynolds were released from their contracts and left the studio on the same day. They were both fired by the same director. Eastwood was fired when the director didn\'t want to use him in a movie because of the wart above his top lip. Reynolds, who was serving as a stunt man, was fired after he shoved the director into a water tank during an argument over how to do a stunt fall.      At the 2005 National Board of Review awards dinner in New York City, Eastwood joked that he would kill filmmaker Michael Moore if Moore ever showed up at his home with a camera (an evident reference to Moore\'s controversial interview Charlton Heston, for Bowling for Columbine (2002)). After the crowd laughed, Eastwood said, ""I mean it."" Moore\'s spokesman said, ""Michael laughed along with everyone else, and took Mr. Eastwood\'s comments in the lighthearted spirit in which they were given."" Publicly, Eastwood has not commented further.      Took acting class from Michael Chekhov in Hollywood.      In 1972 Eastwood attended President Richard Nixon\'s landslide victory celebration in Los Angeles, along with John Wayne, Charlton Heston and Glenn Ford.      Was appointed to serve on the National Council of the Arts by President Nixon in 1972.      Has ruled out the possibility of playing Dirty Harry again, saying he has ""outgrown him age-wise.""      His performance as ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan in Dirty Harry (1971) is ranked #92 on Premiere Magazine\'s 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006).      At a press conference for his movie Mystic River (2003), Eastwood condemned the Iraq war as a ""big mistake"" and defended Sean Penn\'s visit to Baghdad, saying he might have done the same thing but for his age.      Eastwood declined an offer from President George Bush to campaign for him in the 1992 Presidential election. He told an interviewer the next year, ""I think what the ultra-right wing conservatives did to the Republicans is really self-destructive, absolutely stupid"".      His performance as Blondie in Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966) is ranked #50 on Premiere Magazine\'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.      His performance as ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan in Dirty Harry (1971) is ranked #42 on Premiere Magazine\'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.      Ended his longstanding friendship with onetime neighbor William R. Thompkins in 1964.      He claims that he wound up getting the role in Sergio Leone\'s Per un pugno di dollari (1964) because James Coburn, to whom the role was originally offered, wanted $25,000. Eastwood accepted the role for $15,000.      Was offered Al Pacino\'s role in Any Given Sunday (1999), but turned it down because Warner Bros. wouldn\'t let him direct it also.      Is a patron of the arts, notably as an avid collector of western art.      Presented the Golden Globe Award for Best Director to Ang Lee for Brokeback Mountain (2005).      His ""Fistful"" mannerisms was imitated in Canada, by the Tim Horton\'s restaurant chain, to promote the 2005 Southwest chicken sub.      Claims to have been an early choice for the title role in Superman (1978). ""I was like, \'Superman? Nah, nah, that\'s not for me.\' Not that there\'s anything wrong with it. It\'s for somebody, but not me,"" he said.      Whenever asked if he would do a Dirty Harry 6, he often joked that he can imagine Dirty Harry now long retired, and fly-fishing with his .44 magnum.      Cited as America\'s Favorite Movie Star by the Harris Polls conducted in 1993, 1994 and 1997. Tom Hanks and Harrison Ford are the only other actors to be cited as the #1 Movie Star as many times.      He is ""Chevalier de la L\xe9gion d\'Honneur"", a high French distinction that has been conferred on him by President Jacques Chirac on February 17, 2007, as a tribute to his career as an actor and a filmmaker.      Voted for Arnold Schwarzenegger as Governor of California in 2003 and 2006.      Son of Ruth Wood.      In 1969 he attended a celebration of John Wayne\'s 40-year career at Paramount Pictures, along with Lee Marvin, Rock Hudson, Fred MacMurray, James Stewart, Ernest Borgnine, Michael Caine and Laurence Harvey.      Semi-fluent in Italian.      Had to fill in for Charlton Heston at The 44th Annual Academy Awards (1972) until Heston arrived.      Was offered Gregory Peck\'s role in Mackenna\'s Gold (1969), but turned it down to make Hang \'Em High (1968) instead.      The producers of Dirty Harry (1971) originally didn\'t want Eastwood, since they felt he was too young at 41. After older stars like John Wayne, Frank Sinatra and Robert Mitchum turned the film down, Eastwood was cast. He last played Harry Callahan aged 58 in The Dead Pool (1988), which was only a year older than the character was supposed to be in the first film according to the original screenplay.William Friedkin offered him the lead in Sorcerer (1977), but Eastwood didn\'t want to travel anywhere at that time. Jack Nicholson turned the film down for the same reason.      Used to shop at Market Basket a lot when it was still open.      Mentioned in theme song in The Adventures of George the Projectionist (2006).      Received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Southern California. [May 2007]      Learned mountain climbing for The Eiger Sanction (1975) because he felt the scenes were too dangerous for him to pay a stuntman to do for him. He was the last climber up The Totem Pole in Monument Valley, and as part of the contract, the movie crew removed the pitons left by decades of other climbers. The scene where he was hanging off the mountain by a single rope was actually Eastwood, and not a stuntman.      An accomplished jazz pianist, he performs much of the music for his movies, including the scene in the bar in In the Line of Fire (1993).      California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Eastwood into the California Hall of Fame located at The California Museum for History, Women, and the Arts. [December 2006]      Along with John Travolta and Tom Selleck, he attended the formal state dinner at the White House held by President Ronald Reagan to welcome Prince Charles and Princess Diana to the United States in 1985.      In the late 1980s he discussed remaking the classic Sam Peckinpah western Ride the High Country (1962) with Charlton Heston.      He was made a Fellow of the British Film Institute in recognition of his outstanding contribution to film culture.William Goldman said of Eastwood that he was the only person to be a star in the \'70s, \'80s and \'90s. By ""star"" Goldman means Variety\'s list of top ten actors of the decade.      Former longtime companion Sondra Locke blasted Eastwood in her autobiography ""The Good, the Bad, and the Very Ugly"" (1997), describing him as ""a monster who thought nothing of destroying anything inconvenient to him"" and even likening Clint to O.J. Simpson. Sondra reiterated earlier publicized claims that Clint had manipulated her into having two abortions and a tubal ligation in the 1970s and sabotaged her directorial career after their 1989 split, but also made new allegations that he sired two children by another woman in the last three years of the couple\'s relationship (charges mainstream media refused to even acknowledge, despite the fact that the kids\' names and exact birthdates were exposed in the book). Sondra wrote that she learned of Clint\'s ""double life"" from an investigative journalist who had phoned her during depositions in the palimony case with the shocking revelation that Eastwood had a secret family in Carmel living in a house under his business manager\'s name--a fact confirmed when she filed a motion to discover and Clint\'s will was called in for evidence, with the document showing one Jacelyn Reeves and Reeves\'s legally fatherless son and daughter listed as beneficiaries.Sondra Locke filed a $70 million palimony lawsuit against Eastwood in April 1989, two weeks after he changed the locks on their Bel-Air home and moved her possessions into storage while she was at work. Diagnosed with breast cancer in the midst of the hearings, Sondra arranged a private meeting with Clint in November 1990 and achieved an immediate settlement. She received $450,000 lump sum plus monthly support payments, title to a house in West Hollywood that Eastwood had been leasing to her lawful wedded but openly gay husband Gordon Anderson, and a $1.5 million multi-year contract with Warner Bros. to direct films. By 1994, Warner\'s hadn\'t given Locke any directorial assignments and rejected over 30 projects she submitted to the studio. Sondra became convinced the deal was a sham and that she was employed only on paper, so in June 1995 she sued Clint for fraud. Having unearthed a bookkeeping printout to corroborate this charge, Locke asserted the checks she received from Warner\'s actually came from money Eastwood had laundered out of the operating budget for Unforgiven (1992) and written off as production costs. The case went to trial in September 1996, with 10 of the 12 jurors believed to be solidly in Sondra\'s corner, with the only real issue being how much money she would get. At the eleventh hour Clint\'s lawyers convinced him to settle, and on the morning in which jurors were set to begin a second day of deliberation, Locke announced her decision to drop her suit against Eastwood in return for an unspecified monetary award. A separate $100 million lawsuit against Warner Brothers was settled out of court in May 1999, ending the decade-long legal saga.      Though he often smokes in his movies, he is a lifelong non-smoker offscreen.      Although he can handle pistols with either hand equally well, he is left-eye dominant, evident when he shoots a rifle as in Joe Kidd (1972) or Unforgiven (1992), but is right handed, as seen when he wears or handles one pistol.      He and Burt Reynolds had major influences on each other\'s careers. It was he who sent a copy of ""Sharky\'s Machine"" to Reynolds, which gave Reynolds the idea to turn the novel into a movie, Sharky\'s Machine (1981), which went on to garner excellent reviews. On the other hand, it was Reynolds who sent Clint a copy of ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", later made into a film by Eastwood (The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976)). Years later, Reynolds told him about ""this great novel"" called ""The Bridges of Madison County"", and some time later it was shot by Eastwood (The Bridges of Madison County (1995)).      Served as mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, for one term for the nominal salary of $300.      Turned down the role of Captain Willard in Apocalypse Now (1979) because he found the story ""too dark."" The role went to Martin Sheen, whose son Charlie went on to co-star with Clint in The Rookie (1990).      Was offered the role of James Bond in Live and Let Die (1973). He was flattered, but declined, saying that Bond should be played by an English actor.      Has a younger sister named Jeanne Bernhardt (b. 1934) and two nieces, Anna (b. 1958) and Celia (b. 1961).      Owns a hillside mansion in Sun Valley, Idaho and a beachfront estate in Maui.      Had affairs with actresses Inger Stevens, Jean Seberg, Jo Ann Harris, Jamie Rose, Rebecca Perle, Catherine Deneuve, Susan Saint James and Jill Banner, singer Keely Smith, competitive swimmer Anita Lhoest, restaurant critic Gael Greene, wildlife activist Jane Brolin, columnist Bridget Byrne, story analyst Megan Rose, French model Cathy Reghin and former Carmel mayor Jean Grace. Generally, however, Eastwood preferred unknown women whom he would not later accidentally meet. When he was in his early forties, he would often pick up young ladies from the Carmel tourist shops and have sex in his truck parked on Dolores Street.      Practices transcendental meditation twice a day, and said in 2013 that he has been meditating for the past 40 years.      Dislikes hunting, saying that he doesn\'t enjoy killing an animal for no reason.      Father was Clinton Eastwood Sr. (1906-1970), an executive at Georgia Pacific LLC, a pulp and paper manufacturing company. Stepfather, after his widowed mother remarried in 1972, was John Belden Wood (1913-2004), a lumber executive.      Considered for the role of Rambo in First Blood (1982) long before Sylvester Stallone was hired.      He was awarded the American National Medal of the Arts on February 25, 2010 for his services and contributions to the arts.      Contrary to rumors, he is not a vegetarian. However, he does keep to a strict lowfat diet.      Profiled in ""Directors Close Up"" by Jeremy Kagan (2005).      Declined to have a party for his 80th birthday, explaining that at his age he doesn\'t like birthday parties for himself. He said his only plans to celebrate the occasion would be to go out for a drink with his wife.      The genesis of his production company, Malpaso Productions, had a curious origin. When Italian director Sergio Leone approached Eastwood about appearing in what would become the ""Spaghetti Western"" trilogy--Per un pugno di dollari (1964), Per qualche dollaro in pi\xf9 (1965) and Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966)--Eastwood was eager to take it but was advised against it by his agent, suggesting it would be a ""bad move"" (mal paso). Against all advice, the actor went ahead and accepted the ""man with no name"" role and his decision turned out to be a ""good move"". Eastwood never forgot the irony of the situation and adopted ""Malpaso"" as his production company name.      Turned down the role of Harmonica in Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), which went to Charles Bronson.Sergio Leone asked him and his Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966) co-stars Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef to appear in Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). The idea was reportedly scrapped due to scheduling conflicts with other films, although some rumors state they declined when they heard that their characters were going to be killed off by Charles Bronson\'s character in the first five minutes. Leone filmed the scene instead with character actors Woody Strode, Jack Elam and Al Mulock.      Eastwood\'s parents settled in Piedmont, California, where he attended Piedmont Jr. High School, then Piedmont High School from January 1945 to January 1946. Later, Eastwood enrolled at Oakland Technical High School; he was held back due to poor academic scores and was scheduled to graduate in January 1949 as a midyear graduate, although it is not clear if he ever did.      Served as President of the Cannes Jury when Pulp Fiction (1994) won but the film was not his personal choice: ""On the jury here when \'Pulp Fiction\' won, somebody said, \'Oh, Clint Eastwood was on the jury, so he voted for the American film.\' But my sensibilities are European, here is where my success started. Actually, \'Zhang Yimou\'\'s Huo zhe (1994) was my favorite piece, but most of the European jurors seemed to like \'Pulp Fiction\'."".      Five of his movies were nominated for AFI\'s 100 Years...100 Movies: Dirty Harry (1971), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Unforgiven (1992), Mystic River (2003) and Million Dollar Baby (2004). ""Unforgiven"" made the list at #68, 30 places up from its original rank at #98.      Turned down the role of K in Men in Black (1997).Paul Haggis, who wrote the screenplay for Million Dollar Baby (2004), offered Eastwood the role of Hank Deerfiled in In the Valley of Elah (2007). Eastwood turned it down and recommended Tommy Lee Jones, who went on to receive a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance.      He was going to play the villain Two-Face on the Batman (1966) TV series, but the show was canceled before the episode began shooting. He later expressed interest for the same role in Batman Forever (1995).      Although he has been associated with violence throughout his career, he personally detests it and has carefully shown the horrific consequences of violence in films such as Unforgiven (1992), A Perfect World (1993), Absolute Power (1997), Mystic River (2003), Million Dollar Baby (2004) and Gran Torino (2008).      According to Robert Daley, the head of Warner Bros. when Eastwood made 15 pictures there, none of those films ever included preview screenings because Clint ""doesn\'t believe in the preview process"".      He and Warren Beatty are the only actor-directors to earn Best Actor and Best Director Oscar nominations for the same film two times.      His signature character, ""The Man With No Name"", is portrayed by Timothy Olyphant as ""The Spirit of the West"" in Rango (2011).      A former logger, steel furnace stoker and gas station attendant before becoming an actor.      Directed two films concurrently in 1973; High Plains Drifter (1973) and Breezy (1973).      Cinematographer Bruce Surtees and actor Geoffrey Lewis are regulars in Eastwood films (he\'s directed).      Father-in-law of Stacy Poitras.      In Cape Town, South Africa, filming Invictus (2009). [March 2009]      Attending Cannes premiere of latest film Changeling (2008), a period thriller set in the 1920s. [May 2008]      The character Shane Gooseman (""Goose"" for short) from the animated space opera The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers (1986) was based on him and his screen persona.      A guest speaker at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood spent much of his speech time on a largely improvised routine addressing an empty chair representing President Barack Obama. It generated many responses and a lot of discussion. Ex-girlfriend Frances Fisher wrote a condemning post on Facebook and suggested Eastwood\'s appearance was a publicity stunt to get more tickets sold for his new movie Trouble with the Curve (2012), adding ""I\'ve seen this act before. And I didn\'t buy it. Crazy like a fox. I saw the same act sitting with therapists, mediators and lawyers. [...] Even though I am certainly not a Republican, I felt bad for the people who thought this was a good idea."" Several commentators including Bill Maher sidetracked to point out the hypocrisy of Eastwood\'s mere presence at the gathering, since the star\'s inordinately adventurous love life was the antithesis of the ""family values"" advocated by Presidential nominee Mitt Romney on the same stage that evening.      Has played the same character in more than one film three times: The Man with No Name in the Leone trilogy, Philo Beddoe in the Any Which Way movies and Harry Callahan in the Dirty Harry franchise.      He appeared in and directed two Best Picture Academy Award winners: Unforgiven (1992) and Million Dollar Baby (2004). Morgan Freeman also appeared in both films.      Had planned to star in Die Hard (1988) and originally owned the rights to the novel ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" on which the film is based, but opted to make The Dead Pool (1988) instead.      Ranked #19 in Forbes magazine\'s list of the world\'s 40 best-paid entertainers, with estimated earnings of $44 million in 1995 and 1996. [September 1996]      Along with Orson Welles, Laurence Olivier, Woody Allen, Warren Beatty, Kenneth Branagh and Roberto Benigni, he is one of only seven men to receive Academy Award nominations for both Best Actor and Best Director for the same film: Welles for Citizen Kane (1941), Olivier for Hamlet (1948), Allen for Annie Hall (1977), Beatty for both Heaven Can Wait (1978) and Reds (1981), Branagh for Henry V (1989), Eastwood for Unforgiven (1992) and Benigni for La vita \xe8 bella (1997).      Ex-significant other Sondra Locke was legally married to homosexual Gordon Anderson the entire time she and Eastwood were living together, and to this day they are still married in name. While house hunting with Locke in the late seventies, Eastwood introduced himself as ""Mr. Anderson,"" even when he happened to be wearing a Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974) T-shirt. Locke recalled that the sales agents could barely keep a straight face and always looked at their feet when addressing him as such.      Biography in: John Wakeman, editor. ""World Film Directors, Volume Two, 1945- 1985"". Pages 294-302. New York: The H.W. Wilson Company, 1988.      Early in his career he appeared in a ""B"" western, Ambush at Cimarron Pass (1958), in which he was billed third and leading lady Margia Dean was billed second. Years later, after Eastwood had become a superstar actor and director, Dean ran into him at a social function and teased him, ""Just remember, I got top billing over you"".      ""Discovered"" by director Arthur Lubin during filming of Francis Joins the WACS (1954) on location in Marina, Ca.      Has a grandson born in February 1984 named Clinton Eastwood Gaddie through his illegitimate daughter Kimber Tunis (Kimber Eastwood). Clint and Roxanne Tunis are great-grandparents via Kimber\'s son.      Clint and former spouse Maggie Johnson were estranged for at least nine years and legally separated for six before she filed for divorce in May 1984 (it was finalized that November). Johnson had finally decided to make the split official so she could marry Henry Wynberg, a used car salesman slightly younger than herself. The Johnson-Wynberg union ended in 1989 after four years, and in 1992 Wynberg, then 58, married a 19-year-old Costa Rican woman.      Couples in his social circle used to include Merv Griffin & Eva Gabor, Bud Yorkin & Cynthia Sikes, Richard D. Zanuck & Lili Fini Zanuck, Arnold Schwarzenegger & Maria Shriver.      Had a falling out with longtime associate Fritz Manes during the filming of Heartbreak Ridge (1986).      At one time, was dating Barbra Streisand.      Landed his breakthrough role in Per un pugno di dollari (1964) after Charles Bronson, Rory Calhoun, James Coburn, Henry Fonda, Ty Hardin, Steve Reeves, Tony Russel and Henry Silva all turned it down.      Wanted to direct Angels & Demons (2009), but didn\'t get the chance because Ron Howard was contractually obligated to direct it because of his contract from The Da Vinci Code (2006).      Once said that his wide hips were his only physical flaw, except for the chipped tooth he eventually had fixed.      Hired a private detective in the early 1980s when his company, Malpaso Productions, began to receive a series of strange, threatening letters addressed to him mailed from various California locations by someone who seemed to have inside knowledge of his life. The trouble was, the detective had an extremely long list of possible Clint enemies and ex-girlfriends but no real clues as to who might be the culprit. After a while suspicion focused on Jane Brolin, an off-and-on paramour of Eastwood\'s then married to actor James Brolin. Eastwood scoffed at the idea it was her and thought it might be an actress friend of ex-mistress Roxanne Tunis, seeking some kind of revenge on him. One night he drove around the Hollywood Hills with Fritz Manes trying to find this woman\'s address. He tried to convince Manes that they should burgle her place, and see if the lady\'s typewriter matched up with the letters. Manes said no, and the vile letters eventually waxed and waned.      When he was 19, he gained unwanted attention from a 23-year-old schoolteacher who stalked him after a one-night stand and threatened to kill herself.      Wanted to play Charles A. Lindbergh in The Spirit of St. Louis (1957) and penned a letter to director Billy Wilder in October 1954 requesting to meet in person to discuss his potential eligibility for the role. At the time, Eastwood had just done his first screen test for Universal Pictures but had yet to make his acting debut. The role ultimately went to an established star, James Stewart.      Former agent is Leonard Hirshan.      On Christmas morning 2001, his daughter Francesca Eastwood and her mother Frances Fisher narrowly escaped a fire that engulfed their rented house in North Vancouver, Canada. Francesca leaped 15 feet from a second-story window into the arms of her mother and a neighbor, and was treated at a hospital for smoke inhalation. Frances was also treated for burns on her hands. Clint flew up to visit them in the hospital and personally thanked his daughter\'s rescuers.      One of several celebrity endorsers of David Lynch\'s Foundation for Consciousness-Based Education and World Peace.      On a return air trip from a prearranged tryst in Seattle in September 1951, a two-seated plane on which he was aboard ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific Ocean near Point Reyes. Using a life raft, Eastwood and the pilot swam two miles to shore. After-the-fact publicity erroneously infers that this occurrence was somehow war-related.      Former father-in-law of Kirk Fox and Jordan Feldstein.      Admitted to voting for Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956, Richard Nixon in 1968 and 1972, Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984, Ross Perot in 1992, and John McCain in 2008.      Had a long-held obsession with New York Times film critic Pauline Kael because she never liked his work. After her review of The Enforcer (1976), Clint asked a psychiatrist to do an analysis of Kael from her reviews of his past work, which he had memorized verbatim. It concluded that Kael was actually physically attracted to Clint and because she couldn\'t have him she hated him. Therefore, it was some sort of vengeance, according to Clint.      Was interested in the prospect of playing Hank Rearden in a cinematic adaptation of ""Atlas Shrugged"" that was in development by Albert S. Ruddy in the early \'70s.      A slow bloomer in almost every regard, Clint didn\'t leave high school until he was 19 (in an era where most students graduated at 16 or 17), got his first big film role at age 34, waited until he turned 38 to start a family (not including illegitimate unmentionables), made his directorial debut at 41, and received his first Oscar nomination when he was nearly 63.      Accounts from inside the courtroom in the fraud case brought against him by Sondra Locke noted that Eastwood spoke in a barely audible tone on the witness stand and was unable to cross-reference. In one deposition he used the phrase ""I have no records on that"" 79 times.      Developed his movie voice by listening to audio recordings of Marilyn Monroe. He said he\'d noticed Monroe\'s breathy whisper and he thought it was very sexy and since it had worked so well for her, he decided he\'d ""do"" a male version of it himself.      One of his properties, the Rising River Ranch (located in Burney, CA) was formerly owned by the late Bing Crosby.      Parodied by Bill Hader on Saturday Night Live (1975).      Used to be buddies with Robert Donner, George Fargo and Chill Wills.      Past cars have included Audi, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and GMC Yukon. As of 2017 he is still driving at 87 years old and his vehicle of choice is an unmarked Ford Crown Victoria.      According to author Patrick McGilligan, in mid-1993 Eastwood was confronted with the claims of a woman in her late thirties, originally from Washington State, who had researched her adoption and ascertained that he was her biological father. After having his lawyers and business managers check her out, the story goes, Eastwood agreed to have dinner with the woman, who was married to a rich man and was happy to guard her anonymity - she just wanted to meet him - and promised to stay in touch. (It is worth noting that although McGilligan\'s book is touted as being meticulously researched, it does contain easily provable errors concerning important people in Eastwood\'s life, e.g. ex-partner Sondra Locke\'s year of birth, son Kyle Eastwood\'s marital status at a given time and the gender of Clint\'s only grandchild of record, Graylen Eastwood.) In a 2012 documentary that aired on French television, McGilligan stated on camera: ""We don\'t know how many children Clint has had with how many women."" A now-defunct website launched in 2006 by a man claiming to be Eastwood\'s cousin said he also has a son named Lesly, born 13 February 1959 to Rosina Mary Glen. Publicly, Eastwood has not addressed any of these claims or been asked to comment on them by the media.      Avid tennis player in the past.      Turned down The Bucket List (2007).      Doesn\'t use text messaging and prefers landline when he talks on the phone.      His first onscreen kiss was with Carol Channing in The First Traveling Saleslady (1956).      In addition to his multiple houses, he has a well-appointed apartment behind his studio office in Burbank. In Carmel, he used to keep an apartment on the third floor of a building two doors down from the Hog\'s Breath Inn.      Turned down the role of Archie Gates in Three Kings (1999) which went to 31-years-younger George Clooney.      Cited under the pseudonym Mr. Smith in ""Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach"" by Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw.      A July 1968 newspaper item by Dorothy Manners gives insight to Clint\'s rapid rise to stardom: ""Clint Eastwood is on his way to earning $750,000 per picture while the proverbial man in the street is still asking, \'Who\'s Clint Eastwood?\'. He\'s the hottest property sight unseen (almost) in Hollywood today."" Clint was 38 years old.      Has always been allergic to horses, which is why, in his westerns, he is rarely seen in close-up on horseback.Ferris Webster worked exclusively as Eastwood\'s film editor for a decade, but the two had a falling out during postproduction on Firefox (1982).      The only biographical book he\'s ever authorized is ""Clint Eastwood: A Biography"" (1996) by Richard Schickel, which contains extensive plot summary for each of Eastwood\'s movies but leaves his life little documented by comparison.      Clint\'s first wife Maggie encouraged him to marry Frances Fisher, with whom she and her kids Kyle & Alison got along great. Fisher was aware of Roxanne and Kimber Tunis, but it was only after giving birth to Eastwood\'s child that she discovered - not through him - that he had yet another brood with Jacelyn Reeves. Hence it did not come as a surprise to anyone in the know when they decided not to get married and abruptly split. Frances later had a face-to-face encounter with Reeves at the funeral of one of Clint\'s golf buddies.      Has no middle name.      Without taking any acting jobs, he earned $17 million for the period of a year ending in 2010: $6 million apiece for directing Invictus (2009) and Hereafter (2010), $4 million in DVD royalties for Gran Torino (2008), plus $1 million in royalties from earlier projects.      Completely avoids soda and rarely drinks alcohol.      Personal physician Dr. Harry Demopoulos told Muscle & Fitness magazine in 1991 that Clint never eats fat, takes his antioxidants faithfully, works out like a demon and gets plenty of sleep, which is an area that is often neglected in a fitness program.      He started lifting weights at 19, when weight training and bodybuilding were relegated to back-alley sweatshops with black-iron plates.      Eastwood\'s image was untouched by personal scandal of any sort until late April 1989, when his girlfriend of 14 years, Sondra Locke, made it known to the world that she had undergone two abortions and a tubal ligation ""at his specific request,"" she claimed. (""I had done the unthinkable. I had publicly exposed him,"" she commented in retrospect.) The breakup with Locke opened the floodgates to investigative journalism about Eastwood. In July 1989, the National Enquirer reported the existence of a love child he fathered in 1964, and in February 1990, the Star tabloid became the first publication to link Eastwood\'s name with Jacelyn Reeves--who, it turns out, was the mother of two of his unmentionable offspring. Reputable news outlets wouldn\'t touch this information for years after. When Locke\'s memoirs were published in 1997, she was shut out of most venues to promote the book. ""Sadly, it was well suppressed by Clint and WB. [...] I was sad that it did not get the attention I feel it deserved,"" she said in 2013. ""Clint: The Life and Legend,"" a deeply unflattering biography by film historian Patrick McGilligan, was published in Great Britain in 1999, but did not make its way to the United States until 2002, having bounced around publishers for three years amid rumored threats from Eastwood\'s attorneys. Los Angeles Times critic Allen Barra called it ""perhaps the most thoroughly demythologizing book yet written on modern Hollywood."" On Christmas Eve 2002, Eastwood\'s lawyer Marshall Grossman filed a $10 million libel suit against McGilligan and St. Martin\'s Press in San Jose, California. Strangely enough, out of all the sordid stories in the book, the libel claim only covered three points, according to news reports: (1) That Eastwood once punched his first wife Maggie Johnson in the face; (2) That Eastwood is an atheist; (3) That Eastwood used a romantic relationship with an officer\'s daughter in order to avoid being sent overseas during the Korean War. The suit was settled in 2004 without any public disclosure; McGilligan and the publisher admitted no wrongdoing and there was no penalty. A revised and updated version of ""Clint"" was published in 2015, with most of the original content intact. The three cited passages had been excised, and a few other modifications amounting to less than two pages were made. McGilligan says many of things he reported in the first edition are now taken for granted, and one of the reasons Eastwood sued him was an obvious attempt to find out his sources.      His net worth was estimated at $375 million prior to his 2014 divorce from Dina Eastwood. No terms of financial settlement were revealed in the divorce decree, so it\'s unclear where his personal fortune currently stands.      A bachelor again at age 84, he\'s been seen in the company of photographer Erica Tomlinson-Fisher and restaurant hostess Christina Sandera in recent times, and has reportedly bought homes for both women.      Had hair transplants in the mid-1980s. When his head was wrapped in white bandages after the surgery, he said he\'d been in a bicycle accident.      Was asked for permission about his name being used for Marty (Michael J. Fox) in Back to the Future Part III (1990). He consented and was said to be tickled by the homage.      Eastwood was Ratboy (1986)\'s de facto producer and exerted complete creative control, so first-time director Sondra Locke had an obligation to show the revised screenplay to him after she did some collaborative editing with Gordon Anderson. Eastwood sat up in bed one night reading the new draft, while Locke sat next to him, watching him warily. Yet he seemed to be enjoying it, laughing as he read and scribbling in the margins. The next day, Locke arrived at Malpaso offices first and told credited producer Fritz Manes not to worry, Clint loved the changes. Eastwood came in the door about noontime because he never came in early. According to Manes, ""He was purple...I\'ve never seen him so f***ing mad. He takes this thing and he throws it so hard it almost broke the window behind me. He said, \'I\'m closing this thing down. How could you let her do this?\'. I said, \'I thought you knew.\' He said, \'Well, you don\'t have to worry about this piece of s*** anymore. I\'m going out and telling Warners to shut the production down.\'"" Clint went to the outer office and grabbed Sondra and they went off somewhere and had a huge explosion. Manes went over to the floor and picked up the script. ""It had F*** - C***SUCKER - S*** - across every page,"" said Manes. ""Every page had some awful thing on it like some lunatic had scribbled all over it!"" Production ultimately went ahead, but Locke had to abandon Anderson\'s script and all the new characters and details he had created. Sondra cites the Ratboy (1986) debacle as ""the beginning of the end"" of her relationship with Clint, and declared in hindsight that ""obviously whatever control issues he had over my directing were fueled by the hidden birth of a son."" (Although she didn\'t know it at the time, Eastwood was cheating on her and had just become the father of Scott Clinton Reeves [now calling himself Scott Eastwood], born more than 300 miles away to a stewardess in Monterey).      While promoting the reality series Mrs. Eastwood & Company (2012) on E!, Clint\'s then-wife Dina Eastwood told Chelsea Handler: ""I hope we\'re still married when this is over!"". Two weeks after the show premiered, Clint and Dina separated.      Known to be passive-aggressive in private life, communicating only by gesture, inference, and what isn\'t said or done.      Went to the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2013 and 2015.      After being contacted by Sondra Locke in 1994, feminist activist Gloria Steinem said she would orchestrate a nationwide campaign to ban Clint Eastwood films. However, there was no ban on Clint\'s movies, and no explanation of why not.      Although Clint implies that he grew up poor by frequently dropping references to the Great Depression, actually his family lived in a very wealthy part of town, had a swimming pool, belonged to the country club, and each parent drove their own car.      His mother Ruth Wood often brought her own bedsheets when she visited overnight at Clint\'s.      With the exception his cameo as Silvana Mangano\'s husband in the obscure Italian film Le streghe (1967), Space Cowboys (2000) is the only time Eastwood has played a formally married man. His characters are usually single and meet their potential love interest (if any) during the course of the movie. Other times he\'s played divorc\xe9es (Tightrope (1984), Heartbreak Ridge (1986), The Rookie (1990)), widowers (Dirty Harry (1971), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Gran Torino (2008), Trouble with the Curve (2012)) or men who are separated from their wives (True Crime (1999)) but never actually married.      Biographer Patrick McGilligan affirms that ""the people who know Clint best suspect there are other families in his closet"" in addition to his verified children, editorializing ""If Kimber Tunis was kept secret for twenty-five years, and the Washington woman for forty, might there not be others?"".      Left-handed.      To date, 24 of the 46 films Eastwood has starred in depict violence against women. He\'s made 16 films in which a female character is killed, 12 films depicting rape or attempted rape, and 11 films showing a female character battered.      According to the unpublished manuscript ""Take Ten"" by Ria Brown, Anita Lhoest at one point became pregnant with Clint\'s child, but went ahead and had an abortion.      Speaking on condition of anonymity, one of the mothers of Eastwood\'s children told biographer Patrick McGilligan: ""There is no guilt with Clint. Anything that vaguely resembles guilt is channeled into anger. His anger is always intended to prove people wrong, or prove their behavior bad. And if people are wrong or bad, there is nothing for him to feel guilty about."".      Modeled sweaters in a 1972 Playboy layout with a bottomless Susan Blakely.      In general, he wraps films early and uses the actors\' first takes. Most of his films are shot in the spring or summer and released around Christmastime.      According to Robert Daley, ""If they ever called a meeting of all the people Clint has screwed over, they\'d have to hold it in the LA Coliseum."".      Eerily, three of his leading ladies (Inger Stevens, Jean Seberg and Elizabeth Hartman) committed suicide. The former two had affairs with Eastwood.      One afternoon in the early 1970s, Eastwood and Paul E. Lippman were walking around San Francisco when a random woman on the street (who happened to be of short stature) sniffed, ""Oh, you\'re Clint Eastwood . . . I hear you\'re a bum lay!"" Clint, very stunned and at a total loss for words, stretched his neck muscles mightily, as he always did when stuck for a quick response, then finally managed, ""Well . . . uh . . . where did you hear that?"" To which she pertly answered, ""Oh, it\'s all over town."" After a few more neck stretches, Clint invited her for a drink at some club to discuss the matter, then spent the night at Sausalito\'s Alta Mira Hotel trying to prove otherwise. The next morning Lippman asked her if she still thought Clint Eastwood was \'a bum lay\', and she held out a flat hand, palm down, and wiggled it.      Was living in Tiburon, Marin County between 1975 and 1977.Personal Quotes (189)      [on Sondra Locke] She plays the victim very well. Unfortunately she had cancer and so she plays that card.      [to Eli Wallach prior to starting work on Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966)] Never trust anyone on an Italian movie. I know about these things. Stay away from special effects and explosives.      [what he says after a take, instead of ""Cut!""] That\'s enough of that shit.      I like the libertarian view, which is to leave everyone alone. Even as a kid, I was annoyed by people who wanted to tell everyone how to live.      I love every aspect of the creation of motion pictures and I guess I am committed to it for life.      Right now, the state of the movies in America, there\'s an awful lot of people hanging on wires and floating across things and comic book characters and what have you. There seems to be a lot of big business in that, a nice return on some of those.      Nowadays you\'d have many battles before you blow it up, but eventually you\'d take it down. And that\'s okay, I don\'t heavily quarrel with that, but for me personally, having made films for years and directed for 33 years, it just seems to me that I long for people who want to see a story and see character development. Maybe we\'ve dug it out and there\'s not really an audience for that, but that\'s not for me to really worry about.      And I like to direct the same way that I like to be directed.      [on directing] Most people like the magic of having it take a long time and be difficult . . . but I like to move along, I like to keep the actors feeling like they\'re going somewhere, I like the feeling of coming home after every day and feeling like you\'ve done something and you\'ve progressed somewhere. And to go in and do one shot after lunch and another one maybe at six o\'clock and then go home is not my idea of something to do.      I think kids are natural actors. You watch most kids; if they don\'t have a toy they\'ll pick up a stick and make a toy out of it. Kids will daydream all the time.      There\'s really no way to teach you how to act, but there is a way to teach you how to teach yourself to act. That\'s kind of what it is; once you learn the little tricks that work for you, pretty soon you find yourself doing that.      Again, after you\'ve gone through all the various processes and the film comes out and is very successful, you\'re almost afraid to revisit it. You want to save it for a rainy day.      ...in America, instead of making the audience come to the film, the idea seems to be for you to go to the audience. They come up with the demographics for the film and then the film is made and sold strictly to that audience. Not to say that it\'s all bad, but it leaves a lot of the rest of us out of it. To me cinema can be a much more friendly world if there\'s a lot of things to choose from.      You know when you think of a particular director, you think you would have liked to be with them on one particular film and not necessarily on some other one.      At the studios, everybody\'s into sequels or remakes or adaptations of old TV shows. I don\'t know if it\'s because of the corporate environment or they\'re just out of ideas. Pretty soon, they\'re going to be wanting to do one of Rawhide (1959).      I think I\'m on a track of doing pictures nobody wants to do, that they\'re all afraid of. I guess it\'s the era we live in, where they\'re doing remakes of The Dukes of Hazzard (1979) and other old television shows. I must say, I\'m not a negative person, but sometimes I wonder what kind of movies people are going to be making 10 years from now if they follow this trajectory. When I grew up there was such a variety of movies being made. You could go see Sergeant York (1941) or Sitting Pretty (1948) or Sullivan\'s Travels (1941), dozens of pictures, not to mention all the great B movies. Now, they\'re looking for whatever the last hit was. If it\'s The Incredibles (2004), they want \'The Double Incredibles.\' My theory is they ought to corral writers into writers\' buildings like they used to and start out with fresh material.      I liked the Million Dollar Baby (2004)\' script a lot. Warner Bros. said the project had been submitted to them and they\'d passed on it. I said, ""But I like it."" They said, ""Well, it\'s a boxing movie."" And I said, ""It\'s not a boxing movie in my opinion. It\'s a father-daughter love story, and it\'s a lot of other things besides a boxing movie."" They hemmed and hawed and finally said that if I wanted to take it, maybe they\'d pay for the domestic rights only. After that, I\'d be on my own. We took it to a couple of other studios, and they turned it down, much like Mystic River (2003) was turned down, the exact same pattern. People who kept calling and saying, ""Come on, work with us on stuff."" I\'d give it to them, and they\'d go, ""Uh, we were thinking more in terms of Dirty Harry coming out of retirement."" And who knows? Maybe when it comes out they\'ll be proven right.      Plastic surgery used to be a thing where older people would try to go into this dream world of being 28 years old again. But now, in Hollywood, even people at 28 are having work done. Society has made us believe you should look like an 18-year-old model all your life. But I figure I might as well just be what I am.      [on trying to get Million Dollar Baby (2004) made at Warner Bros.] They might have been a little more interested if I said I wanted to do ""Dirty Harry 9"" or something.      [2005 Academy Awards acceptance speech for Best Director for Million Dollar Baby (2004)] Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. I\'d like to thank my wife, who is my best pal down here. And my mother, who was here with me in 1993. She was only 84 then. But she\'s here with me again tonight. And she just -- so, at 96, I\'m thanking her for her genes.It was a wonderful adventure. It takes a -- to make a picture in 37 days, it takes a well-oiled machine. And that well-oiled machine is the crew -- the cast, of course, you\'ve met a lot of them. But there\'s still Margo and Anthony and Michael and Mike and Jay and everybody else who was so fabulous in this cast. And the crew, Campanelli. Billy Coe and, of course, Tom Stern, who is fantastic. And Henry Bumstead, the great Henry Bumstead who is the head of our crack geriatrics team. And Henry and Jack Taylor, and Dick Goddard [Richard C. Goddard], all those guys. Walt and everybody. I can\'t think of everybody right now.I\'m drawing a blank right now. But, Warren, you were right. And thank you, for your confidence earlier in the evening. I\'m just lucky to be here. Lucky to be still working. And I watched Sidney Lumet, who is 80, and I figure, ""I\'m just a kid. I\'ll just -- I\'ve got a lot of stuff to do yet."" So thank you all very much. Appreciate it.      [1985] My old drama coach used to say, ""Don\'t just do something, stand there."" Gary Cooper wasn\'t afraid to do nothing.      One of the first films I went to - I went with my dad because my mother didn\'t want to go see a war movie - was Sergeant York (1941). My dad was a big admirer of Sergeant York stories from [World War I]. It was directed by Howard Hawks. That was when I first became aware of movies, who made them, who was involved.      Most people who\'ll remember me, if at all, will remember me as an action guy, which is OK. There\'s nothing wrong with that. But there will be a certain group which will remember me for the other films, the ones where I took a few chances. At least, I like to think so.      The plan was, when I first started directing in the 1970s, to get more involved in production and directing so at some point in my life, when I decided I didn\'t want to act anymore, I didn\'t have to suit up.      I feel very close to the western. There are not too many American art forms that are original. Most are derived from European art forms. Other than the western and jazz or blues, that\'s all that\'s really original.      In The Bridges of Madison County (1995) Kincaid\'s a peculiar guy. Really, he\'s kind of a lonely individual. He\'s sort of a lost soul in mid-America. I\'ve been that guy.      I think people jumped to conclusions about Dirty Harry (1971) without giving the character much thought, trying to attach right-wing connotations to the film that were never really intended. Both the director [Don Siegel] and I thought it was a basic kind of drama - what do you do when you believe so much in law and order and coming to the rescue of people and you just have five hours to solve a case? That kind of impossible effort was fun to portray, but I think it was interpreted as a pro-police point of view, as a kind of rightist heroism, at a time in American history when police officers were looked down on as ""pigs"", as very oppressive people - I\'m sure there are some who are, and a lot who aren\'t. I\'ve met both kinds.      You have to trust your instincts. There\'s a moment when an actor has it, and he knows it. Behind the camera you can feel the moment even more clearly. And once you\'ve got it, once you feel it, you can\'t second-guess yourself. You can find a million reasons why something didn\'t work. But if it feels right, and it looks right, it works. Without sounding like a pseudointellectual dipshit, it\'s my responsibility to be true to myself. If it works for me, it\'s right.      None of the pictures I take a risk in cost a lot, so it doesn\'t take much for them to turn a profit. We don\'t deal in big budgets. We know what we want and we shoot it and we don\'t waste anything. I never understand these films that cost twenty, thirty million dollars when they could be made for half that. Maybe it\'s because no one cares. We care.      [on how he decided to do Per un pugno di dollari (1964)] I\'d done Rawhide (1959) for about five years. The agency called and asked if I was interested in doing a western in Italy and Spain. I said, ""Not particularly."" They said, ""Why don\'t you give the script a quick look?"" Well, I was kind of curious, so I read it, and I recognized it right away as Y\xf4jinb\xf4 (1961), a Kurosawa [Akira Kurosawa] film I had liked a lot. Over I went, taking the poncho with me - yeah the cape was my idea.      There\'s a rebel lying deep in my soul. Anytime anybody tells me the trend is such and such, I go the opposite direction. I hate the idea of trends. I hate imitation; I have a reverence for individuality. I got where I am by coming off the wall. I\'ve always considered myself too individualistic to be either right-wing or left-wing.      I don\'t like the wimp syndrome. No matter how ardent a feminist may be, if she is a heterosexual female, she wants the strength of a male companion as well as the sensitivity. The most gentle people in the world are macho males, people who are confident in their masculinity and have a feeling of well-being in themselves. They don\'t have to kick in doors, mistreat women, or make fun of gays.      I don\'t believe in pessimism. If something doesn\'t come up the way you want, forge ahead.      The reason I became a Republican is because [Dwight D. Eisenhower] was running. A hero from World War II, a charismatic individual, a military man, a non-attorney - even then I liked that! I was a very young person voting for the first time. A lot of people joke that a conservative is a liberal who\'s made his first $100,000 and then decides,""Wait a second, I want to save this, why are they taxing it away?"". Today the country\'s in kind of a turmoil over taxing. Being raised in the thirties, watching my parents work hard to make ends meet, with jobs scarce, and then the war years - it tends to make a person a little more fiscally conscious than if you\'ve been born into a wealthier family. You know, if you go to most people who are self-made and ask them what their political philosophy is, usually they\'re a little more conservative than people who had a better start.      This film cost $31 million. With that kind of money I could have invaded some country.      They say marriages are made in Heaven. But so is thunder and lightning.      I\'ve always supported a certain amount of gun control. I think California has always had a mandatory waiting period, so we were never concerned about it like the rest of the country. Some states didn\'t have any at all. So I\'ve always supported that. I think it\'s very important that guns don\'t get in the wrong hands, and, yes, I would support most of that. I don\'t know too much about trigger locks. I\'ve never really discussed that with anyone. But I do feel that guns - it\'s very important to keep them out of the hands of felons or anyone who might be crazy with it.      I\'ve thought about retiring for years now. When I did Play Misty for Me (1971) in 1970, I thought that if I could pull this off maybe I could step behind the camera, and it would be time to see the end of me. Every year I have threatened to do that - and here I am. So it may come sooner than you think.      [on World War II] I feel terrible for both sides in that war and in all wars. A lot of innocent people get sacrificed. It\'s not about winning or losing, but mostly about the interrupted lives of young people.      I\'ve done a lot of violent movies, especially in the early days. My recent efforts, like The Bridges of Madison County (1995), weren\'t too violent. In recent years I\'ve done less, and, yes, I am concerned about violence in film. In \'92, when I did Unforgiven (1992), which is a film that had a very anti- violence and anti-gun play - anti-romanticizing of gun play theme, I remember that Gene Hackman was concerned about it, and we both discussed the issue of too much violence in films. It\'s escalated ninety times since Dirty Harry (1971) and those films were made.      Maybe I\'m getting to the age when I\'m starting to be senile or nostalgic or both, but people are so angry now. You used to be able to disagree with people and still be friends. Now you hear these talk shows, and everyone who believes differently from you is a moron and an idiot - both on the Right and the Left.      I like to play the line and not wander too far to either side. If a guy has just had a bad day in the mines and wants to see a good shoot \'em up, that\'s great.      My involvement goes deeper than acting or directing. I love every aspect of the creation of motion pictures and I guess I\'m committed to it for life.      Whatever success I\'ve had is due to a lot of instinct and a little luck.      I\'ve always had the ability to say to the audience, watch this if you like, and if you don\'t, take a hike.      I\'ve actually had people come up to me and ask me to autograph their guns.      [on former President Ronald Reagan] Yes, I liked him very much. When he was a former president of the Screen Actors Guild, I don\'t think he had the vast support that a lot of other presidents have had. So I don\'t know why that is, it\'s just the nature of things.      [when asked if he is still registered as a Republican] Yes, I am. I started - I enrolled as a Republican in 1951 when Dwight D. Eisenhower was running. And I was in the military. I was a fan of his. And that\'s how I got started off. I was never - my parents were mixed, I think one Republican, one Democrat, so I didn\'t have any grand-pappies to influence me.      When I was doing The Bridges of Madison County (1995), I said to myself, ""This romantic stuff is really tough. I can\'t wait to get back to shooting and killing.""      [when asked if he has disappointed his conservative fans by directing Million Dollar Baby (2004)] Well, I got a big laugh out of that. These people are always bitching about ""Hollyweird"", and then they start bitching about this film. Are they all so mad because The Passion of the Christ (2004) is only up for the makeup award and a couple of other minor things? Extremism is so easy. You\'ve got your position, and that\'s it. It doesn\'t take much thought. And when you go far enough to the right you meet the same idiots coming around from the left.      [on John Huston] It\'s another aspect of the character that pleased me: he was interested in other things besides his art. He liked women, gambling, living the high life. He could have a life parallel to his work. I could identify with this type of behavior. But, because of this very fact, he became attracted more and more by other things, so that what interested him in life moved him away from his art to the point that he nearly lived a tragedy. And the tragedy brings him back to reality. If you study Huston\'s life, you realize that at the age of nineteen he thought he didn\'t have long to live because of a heart defect a doctor has notified him of as a result of a misdiagnosis. It drove him to elaborate a personal philosophy according to which he would profit from life to the maximum. He didn\'t take care of himself - he was a confirmed smoker, a heavy drinker - and yet he lived to be more than eighty. Paul Newman spoke to me about him when we were acting at the same time, each in a different movie, in Tucson, Arizona. He was starring in The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean (1972) and I was doing Joe Kidd (1972) with John Sturges. Huston drank martinis and smoked cigars all night long, slept from one o\'clock to four o\'clock in the morning because he was an insomniac, did everything he shouldn\'t do to live to be old, and yet he died at a very great age! It was the same thing with John Wayne, who was first of all the opposite of a health fanatic.      I never considered myself a cowboy, because I wasn\'t. But I guess when I got into cowboy gear I looked enough like one to convince people that I was.      If you want a guarantee, buy a toaster.      I always cry when I watch myself on screen.      Guys I thought of as heroes were like Joe Louis and, maybe during the war, there was General [George S. Patton], of course, and maybe [Dwight D. Eisenhower], who was the head of the Allied forces. And Gary Cooper. There were just a handful of men and a handful of women. Now, people become stars who are just heiresses or something.      I also wonder how I got this far in life. Growing up, I never knew what I wanted to do. I was not a terribly good student or a very vivacious, outgoing person. I was just kind of a backward kid. I grew up in various little towns and ended up in Oakland, California, going to a trade school. I didn\'t want to be an actor, because I thought an actor had to be an extrovert - somebody who loved to tell jokes and talk and be a raconteur. And I was something of an introvert. My mother used to say: ""You have a little angel on your shoulder."" I guess she was surprised I grew up at all, never mind that I got to where I am. The best I can do is quote a line from Unforgiven (1992): ""Deserve\'s got nothing to do with it.""      Every movie I make teaches me something, and that\'s why I keep making them. I\'m at that stage of life when I could probably stop and just hit golf balls. But in filming these two movies about Iwo Jima, I learnt about war and about character. I also learnt a lot about myself.      I was a teenager when the battle of Iwo Jima took place. I remember hearing about the bond drive and the need to maintain the war effort. Back then, people had just come through 10 years of a Depression, and they were used to working for everything. I still have an image of someone coming to our house when I was about six years old, offering to cut and stack the wood in our back yard if my mother would make him a sandwich.      The Americans who went to Iwo Jima knew it would be a tough fight, but they always believed they\'d win. The Japanese were told they wouldn\'t come home - they were being sent to die for the Emperor. People have made a lot out of that very different cultural approach. But as I got into the storytelling for the two movies [Flags of Our Fathers (2006) and Letters from Iwo Jima (2006)], I realised that the 19-year-olds from both sides had the same fears. They all wrote poignant letters home saying: ""I don\'t want to die."" They were all going through the same thing, despite the cultural differences.      I guess if you see both of the movies [Flags of Our Fathers (2006) and Letters from Iwo Jima (2006)] together, they sum up as an antiwar film. Whether it\'s about territory or religion, war is horrifyingly and depressingly archaic. But I didn\'t set out to make a war movie. I cared about those three fellows - Bradley, Hayes and Gagnon [John H. Bradley, Ira H. Hayes, \'Ren\xe9 A. Gagnon\'] - the headliners on that war-bond circus. The young men were taken off the front lines, wined and dined, introduced to movie stars. But it felt wrong to them.      As for me, I like being behind the camera instead of in front of it. I can wear what I want. Will I act again? I never say never. I like doing things where I can stretch and go in different directions. I\'m not looking to take it easy. Like the Marines on Iwo Jima, I understand that if you really want something, you have to be ready to fight.      Life is a constant class, and once you think you know it all, you\'re due to decay. You\'re due to slide. I have to keep challenging myself and try something I haven\'t done before. The studios aren\'t always happy with that. When I wanted to make Mystic River (2003), the studio said, ""Uh-oh, it\'s so dark."" And I said, ""Well, it\'s important. And it\'s a nice story."" Then the next movie, Million Dollar Baby (2004), they said, ""Who wants to see a picture about a girl boxing?"" And I said, ""It\'s really a father-daughter love story. Boxing just happens to be what\'s going on."" They didn\'t have much faith. So there are always obstacles and people afraid to take risks. That\'s why you end up with remakes of old TV shows as movies. But playing it safe is what\'s risky, because nothing new comes out of it.      [on the Iraq war] My druthers would have been, ""Get a more benevolent dictator and stick him in. You know, try somebody a little less mean."" You don\'t go in there and fire the army. The army\'s got to do something. When you fire \'em, you leave them all unemployed. Worst thing in the world. Just get somebody else who they respect and bring him on your side. That\'s one way of doing it.      [on President George W. Bush] You\'ve got to admire somebody who stands up for what they believe regardless of how the polls go. A lot of presidents do everything by the polls. They do a focus group then all of a sudden they say, ""OK, that\'s what I\'m going to be for because that\'s where focus group is leading me.      [on the Iraq war] I wasn\'t for going in there. Only because democracy isn\'t something that you get overnight. I don\'t think America got democracy overnight. It\'s something we had to fight for and believe in.      [on John Wayne] I gave him a piece of material that I thought had potential for us to do as a younger guy and an older guy. He wrote me back critical of it. He had seen High Plains Drifter (1973), and he didn\'t think that represented Americana like She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and other John Ford westerns. I never answered him.      [on Sergio Leone] I spun off Sergio and he spun off me. I think we worked well together. I like his compositions. He has a very good eye. I liked him, I liked his sense of humor, but I feel it was mutual. He liked dealing with the kind of character I was putting together.      ""Macho"" was a fashionable word in the 1980s. Everybody was kind of into it, what\'s macho and what isn\'t macho. I really don\'t know what macho is. I never have understood. Does it mean somebody who swaggers around exuding testosterone? And kicks the gate open and runs sprints up and down the street? Or does handsprings or whatever? Or is macho a quiet thing based on your security. I remember shaking hands with Rocky Marciano. He was gentle, he didn\'t squeeze your hand. And he had a high voice. But he could knock people around, it was a given. That\'s macho. Muhammad Ali is the same. If you talked with him in his younger years, he spoke gently. He wasn\'t kicking over chairs. I think some of the most macho people are the gentlest.      I was tired of playing the nice, clean-cut cowboy in Rawhide (1959), I wanted something earthier. Something different from the old-fashioned Western. You know: Hero rides in, very stalwart, with white hat, man\'s beating a horse, hero jumps off, punches man, schoolmarm walks down the street, sees this situation going on, slight conflict with schoolmarm, but not too much. You know schoolmarm and hero will be together in exactly 10 more reels, if you care to sit around and wait, and you know the man beast horse with eventually get comeuppance from hero this guy bushwhacks him in reel nine. But [Per un pugno di dollari (1964)] was different; it definitely had satiric overtones. The hero was an enigmatic figure, and that worked within the context of this picture. In some films, he would be ludicrous. You can\'t have a cartoon in the middle of a Renoir.      In those days, they\'d make interview tests, not acting tests. They\'d sit you in front of the camera and talk--just as we\'re talking now. I thought I was an absolute clod. It looked pretty good; it was photographed well, but I thought, ""If that\'s acting, I\'m in trouble"". But they signed me up as a contract player--which was a little lower than working in the mailroom.      I like working with actors who don\'t have anything to prove.      [on Ambush at Cimarron Pass (1958)] Probably the lousiest western ever made.      [on the retirement of friend and fellow actor Gene Hackman]: It is a sad thing. I know his agent and I saw him recently, and he said, \'Can\'t you talk Gene into coming back?\' I said, \'I\'d love to see him come back, but I think it\'s not very nice to ride him.\' He\'s too good an actor not to be performing but, by the same token, he probably thinks that\'s enough.      [on Gran Torino (2008)] That will probably do it for me as far as acting is concerned. You always want to quit while you are ahead. You don\'t want to be like a fighter who stays too long in the ring until you\'re not performing at your best.      There are certain things you have to be realistic about. Dirty Harry would not be on a police department at my age so we\'ll move on from that.      Having a good person as a foil certainly helps, because acting is an ensemble art form. Clark Gable is only as good as Claudette Colbert in It Happened One Night (1934).      [on Paint Your Wagon (1969)] It wasn\'t like Singin\' in the Rain (1952), where it had a cohesive plot line. They started out with a real dramatic story and then made it fluffy. When they changed it around, I tried to bail out. It wasn\'t my favorite. I wasn\'t particularly nervous about singing on film. My dad was a singer and we\'d have sing-arounds. But certainly [Frank Sinatra] wasn\'t worried.      With Every Which Way But Loose (1978), they gave me the script and I thought, ""This is something. This is kinda crazy. But there\'s something kind of hip about it. This guy\'s out drifting along and his best friend is an orangutan"". I mean, the scenes of talking to an orangutan about your troubles, I\'d never seen anything quite like it. He has a romance that falls through, he doesn\'t get the girl, and then he goes off with the orangutan. I thought, What could be better? I wouldn\'t put it in the time capsule of films you did that you thought were great, but everything\'s a challenge.Gene Hackman was interesting because I gave the Unforgiven (1992) script to his agent and he said no, he didn\'t want to do anything violent. But I went back to him and said, ""I know where you\'re coming from. You get to a certain age and I\'m there too, where you don\'t want to tell a lot of violent stories, but this is a chance to make a great statement"".      At this particular time in my life, I\'m not doing anything as a moneymaker. It\'s like I\'m pushing the envelope the other way to see how far we can go to be noncommercial. But I\'m definitely not going for the demographics of 13- to 15-year-olds. I didn\'t know if Mystic River (2003) would go over at all. I had a hard time getting it financed, to tell you the truth. But I just told Warners the same thing I did with Million Dollar Baby (2004): ""I don\'t know if this is going to make any money. But, I think I can make a picture that you\'d be proud to have in your library.      People have lost their sense of humor. In former times we constantly made jokes about different races. You can only tell them today with one hand over your mouth or you will be insulted as a racist. I find that ridiculous. In those earlier days every friendly clique had a \'Sam the Jew\' or \'Jose the Mexican\' - but we didn\'t think anything of it or have a racist thought. It was just normal that we made jokes based on our nationality or ethnicity. That was never a problem. I don\'t want to be politically correct. We\'re all spending too much time and energy trying to be politically correct about everything.      [on the possibility of a Dirty Harry (1971) sequel] I\'m 78 years old, and you\'re pretty well drummed out of the police force by that age. There could be a scenario. I suppose if some mythical writer came out of nowhere and it was the greatest thing on the planet, I\'d certainly have to think about it. But it\'s not like I\'ve ever courted it. I feel like that was an era of my life, and I\'ve gone on to other things. I\'m not sure about being Dirty Harry again--but who knows?      I keep finding interesting stories, or they come to me, so I\'ll keep making movies.      [on a possible return to acting after saying he was giving it up with Gran Torino (2008)] I\'m like Jaws 2 (1978): ""Just when you think it\'s safe to go back in the water...""      [on Angelina Jolie] She\'s wonderful. To me, she\'s like a throwback to the women in film of the Forties. Not to say women today aren\'t great, but back then there was more individuality. They didn\'t have the same Botox look. Angelina has that great individuality, her own look and her own style. I think she would have been just as big a name in that era, the same as Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis and Ingrid Bergman.      [on Million Dollar Baby (2004)] It\'s a tragedy that could have been written by the Greeks or Shakespeare.      I don\'t quite understand this obsession about doing remakes and making television series into feature films. I would rather see them encourage writers with new ideas in all different genres like they used to in the heyday of movies.      [in 2002, on Michael Cimino] George Lucas made Howard the Duck (1986), and the guy who made Waterworld (1995) - those films didn\'t destroy them. Critics were set up to hate Heaven\'s Gate (1980) . . . the picture didn\'t work with the public. If it had, it would have been the same as Titanic (1997). ""Titanic"" worked, so all is forgiven. Certain things may have been his fault. The accolades for The Deer Hunter (1978) probably made him think, ""I am a genius, king of the world"". But if you say you\'re king of the world then people will root for you to fall . . . I\'ve always said that if you\'re prepared to accept reviews saying you\'re brilliant, you better be prepared to accept reviews saying you\'re a burn. The guy calling you a bum may be wrong, but the guy calling you brilliant may be wrong, too. Michael needs to make an intimate, smaller picture, do a film for five or six weeks, with no special effects, flying by the seats of his pants, to not be afraid and pull the trigger.      [on death] I don\'t think older people think about it that much, my mother was 97. She passed away a few years back. The only thing she ever said to me, toward the last, she said, \'I want out of here, I am tired.\' And I said \'No, no, three more years. We get the century mark.\' I figured I could coax her into more after that, but when she finally did pass away, she couldn\'t talk because she had had a stroke. They said do you want to be resuscitated for while, and she said \'no.\' So, I had to grant her that wish. She had no fear and I think as you get older -- you probably have more fear as a younger person than you do as an older person. Because as an older person you have stacked up a lot of background and time-in-grade, so to speak, so you are probably thinking what the hell \'I have had a good time.      If you believe in reincarnation you\'re putting too much on the other side. I believe you have just one shot at life, and you should do the best you can with that shot. And I suppose you should be thankful that you\'ve been given the ability to do certain things in life, and not be greedy enough to want to stay around forever.      [on the Rocky (1976) movies] I loved the first one. I always admired Sylvester Stallone\'s tenacity to go ahead and get that made.      I would never have been able to pass the Bill Clinton-Gary Hart test. No one short of Mother Teresa could pass.      [on directing Leonardo DiCaprio as J. Edgar Hoover] He could make a lot of money making mechanical genre pictures but he wants to be challenged. And it\'s much more of a challenge to play someone who doesn\'t have the slightest thing in common with you.      [on Bruce Surtees] He was fearless. He wasn\'t afraid to give you sketchy lighting if you asked for it. He didn\'t believe in flat light or just bright, \'Rexall drugstore\' lighting, which a lot of times you can get if you get somebody that isn\'t very imaginative. He was perfect for me, because we didn\'t have very big budgets in those days. He\'d made dollies by towing a blanket across the floor with the cameraman sitting on it.      I don\'t believe in pessimism. If something doesn\'t come out the way you want, forge ahead. If you think it\'s going to rain, it will.      [on surviving a plane crash in the early 1950s] They had one plane, a Douglas AD, sort of a torpedo bomber of the World War II vintage, and I thought I\'d hitch on that. Everything went wrong. Radios went out. Oxygen ran out. And finally we ran out of fuel up around Point Reyes, California, and went in the ocean. So we went swimming. It was late October, November. Very cold water. I found out many years later that it was a white shark breeding ground, but I\'m glad I didn\'t know that at the time or I\'d have just died.      [on his planned remake of A Star Is Born (1937)] I talked about that for a while with Warner Brothers\' people and we\'re still playing with that idea. But the problem at the beginning was they were more infatuated with just the idea of the casting. They were talking about having Beyonc\xe9 Knowles in it, and she was very popular, but she also is very active and it\'s hard to get a time scheduled, so we never could get that worked out. But I\'m still playing with the idea.      I\'ve done war movies because they\'re always loaded with drama and conflict. But as far as actual participation ... it\'s one of those things that should be done with a lot of thought, if it needs to be done. Self-protection is a very important thing for nations, but I just don\'t like to see it.      Extremism is so easy. You\'ve got your position and that\'s it. It doesn\'t take much thought. And when you go far enough to the right,you meet the same idiots coming around from the left.      The stronger the participation of the female characters, the better the movie. They knew that in the old days, when women stars were equally as important as men.      There\'s a rebel lying deep in my soul. Anytime anybody tells me the trend is such and such, I go the opposite direction.      I like the image of the piano player: the piano player sits down, plays, tells his story, and then gets up and leaves - letting the music speak for itself.      [after the Carmel city council refused his architectural plans for a downtown construction] They don\'t know who they\'re fuckin\' with. I\'ll build that damn building the way I want it if I have to run the fucking city council to do it.      My father used to say to me, \'Show \'em what you can do, and don\'t worry about what you\'re gonna get. Say you\'ll work for free and make yourself invaluable\'.      [to Steve Kroft, why he refuses to say how many children he has] Well, \'cause I - you - they\'re - there are other people that are involved there and they\'re vulnerable people. I can protect myself, but they can\'t.      [press statement in response to claims made by ex-significant other Sondra Locke, 4/27/89] I adamantly deny and deeply resent the accusation that either one of those abortions or the tubal ligation were done at my demand, request or even suggestion. As to the abortions, I told Locke that whether to have children or terminate her pregnancies was a decision entirely hers. Particularly with regard to the tubal ligation, I encouraged Locke to make her own decision after she had consulted with a physician about the appropriateness of and the necessity for that surgical procedure.      [about Patrick McGilligan\'s unauthorized biography of him, 2002] I don\'t know if this is the same book that came out in England, but if it is, it\'s just very factually inaccurate. He has me involved with women I\'ve never met and attending schools I\'ve never gone to - and there was a photograph supposedly of me that wasn\'t me. The stories about my father weren\'t true. There were incidents described that never took place; I\'ve never broken a window with a ball peen hammer in my life. If you can\'t even get the little stuff right, then how are you going to get the big stuff right? But I don\'t want to talk about it too much, because I hate even giving it credence. It\'s a very mean-spirited book. I don\'t care if you write something bad about me, as long as it\'s true. I\'m not Mr. Evangelical Pure-as-the-snow. I just want the true (stories) out. They\'re fair game. But when they\'re made up, they\'re not fair game.      [on misrepresentation of his early work] My parts ranged from one-liners to four-liners, but to look at some of the billings in TV Guide these days, you\'d think I co-starred in those films.      [on director Arthur Lubin] We spent a lot of time together, traveled together. He liked me a lot; got me into the talent program at Universal, gave me a lot of breaks. Bought me some nice clothes, too. That\'s when people started wondering about us!      I tried being reasonable, I didn\'t like it.      [to Sondra Locke, 1975] I never knew I could love somebody so much, and feel so peaceful about it at the same time.Alfred Hitchcock once told me, when I was analyzing a lot of things about his pictures, \'Clint, you must remember, it\'s only a movie.\'      Crimes against children are the most heinous crime. That, for me, would be a reason for capital punishment because children are innocent and need the guidance of an adult society.      [answering David Letterman\'s declarative question, ""You have seven children?""] Uh, at least.      I was always respectful of people who were deeply religious because I always felt that if they gave themselves to it, then it had to be important to them. But if you can go through life without it, that\'s OK, too. It\'s whatever suits you.      [on home pornography] The ultimate turn-on.      My grandfather lived to be late 90s on one side and on the other side, 70s or something. And my father died young, at 63. But he didn\'t take very good care of himself.      I grew up with J. Edgar Hoover. He was the G-man, a hero to everybody, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation was the big, feared organization. He was ahead of his time as far as building up forensic evidence and fingerprinting. But he took down a lot of innocent people, too.      It\'s much more fun to play something you\'re nothing like than what you are... It\'s much easier to hide yourself in a character.      [characterizing his relationship with Roxanne Tunis] It didn\'t mean anything; it was just an affair. I was young and . . . anyway she was a stand-in and extra on the show, and she was really crazy about me, and always hanging out in my dressing room.      Plagiarism is always the biggest thing in Hollywood.      I always thought of myself as a character actor. I never thought of myself as a leading man.      I love stories about women.      When I was a kid, I thought movies just came from air. I thought they just appeared.      Why am I a star? It can\'t be because of looks.      I kind of make a film for myself to sort of express myself.      [speaking in 2007 about troubled actress June Fairchild] My heart sank when I heard of what had become of June. There are organizations that can help her but I\'m sure she could also use a friendly face right now. I\'d really like to meet her.      I\'ve been through my womanizer part of my life. There was a point when it was an illness, just compulsive, but that\'s behind me now. I\'ve never considered myself addicted to anything, but if I was, that was it.      Everybody has certain things they wish they hadn\'t done in life. They wish they hadn\'t kicked their dog when they were ten or something.      I like Italian movies. I was frequently there in the \'60s, in Rome and the vicinity. It was a great period in life. I was very influenced by their stuff.      [January 1962] There has to be something for me beyond western roles, which rarely give you a full feeling of acting accomplishment. Have you ever heard of a western star being called an actor\'s actor? I\'ll bet not!      [April 2010] I planned on not working at this time in my life, but I am enjoying working more now than I ever have. I have been lucky enough to work in a profession I really like and I figure I will continue until somebody hits me over the head.      In the past I have been with women who wanted more from me than I was ever willing to give. I was probably not as attentive as I could have been. I can be selfish and some of the women didn\'t have a good idea of their self. They wanted me to mould them and I just can\'t do that.      I\'m not good in big crowds. I prefer smaller, one-to-one nights out, which is why I\'ve never been single. I like the company of women, but I do go for longer-term relationships than flings. The best things to come of all those relationships are my children.      I\'ve waited all my life for a woman like Dina. She is bright, funny, independent. It\'s fate that I met her when I was in my sixties. I\'d love to have been with her 20, 30 years ago and I would have settled down much sooner. I spent my twenties and thirties being angry, then my forties and fifties being disappointed. It\'s only in the last part of my life that I\'ve learned to be happy.      [if he could give advice to his younger self] He was never a smart kid. I was a slow learner, so I\'d say speed up the process a bit-and maybe practice a little more!      [December 2014] I just went through a period where my DNA was in demand for a while. I think that\'s all ended-but, you never know!      [on marriage] I haven\'t exactly been successful at it, but I made a couple of attempts. I\'ve had moments of success interrupted by moments of satyr. Shelley Berman used to say that. I admire people who can accomplish and do it, but it\'s very difficult in today\'s society, because there are so many things pulling at people. People gain different interests as time goes by, so they decide that they want to try something else. You have to keep trying! You don\'t want to give up and be so cynical that, you say, \'Never!\' But, maybe, at my stage in life, there\'s a silver act. Never say never.Sergio Leone loved long stories and long pictures. To me, I don\'t mind a long picture if you\'ve got a lot of story. But if you\'re just making a long movie to just show off more production value, I think you can edit some of that stuff down. That\'s where he and I would differ.      I am concerned about violence in films. In 1992, when I did Unforgiven (1992), which is a film that is very anti-violence and very anti-gun, I remember that Gene Hackman was concerned about it too. And we both discussed how much violence in films has escalated since Dirty Harry (1971) and other movies I made.      Films can go overboard on violence but the Dirty Harry films don\'t. We don\'t use slow motion violence for instance, or lingering blood squirts. Also, Harry Callahan is an honorable man and a hero to middle America. I\'d question films like Taxi Driver (1976) where the hero is mentally ill.      As soon as I read that line in the script, ""Go ahead make my day"", I knew audiences would love it.      [on John Ford] I remember seeing Stagecoach (1939) as a kid when it first came out. Ford had an influence on me subconsciously, and I watched it in a dark theatre with my knees up. Sometimes twice in a row. There\'s something about the way he approached the subject that broke down clich\xe9s of the era. I think he was always trying to make social statements in his movies, and with Stagecoach he used the western to do it efficiently.      Too many directors don\'t know what the hell they\'re doing. They\'ll do multiple takes on scenes and try out different angles and lighting. I don\'t like that. If you can\'t see it yourself straight away, you shouldn\'t be a director.      [on his dissatisfaction with his diminishing role in the ""Dollars"" trilogy] In the first, I was just about alone. Then there were two of us. And now are three of us. If it goes on like this I\'m going to end up in a detachment of cavalry.      There\'s a bar I used to go to on Sunset Boulevard that was a straight bar that\'s now a gay bar. I think I went into it once some years later, and I looked around and said, \'Oh, yeah, it\'s a gay bar.\' I still finished my beer.      [on his daughter Kimber Eastwood and her mother Roxanne Tunis] I give them a few thousand here and there, but I always give it in cash so they can\'t prove anything. Besides, Kimber is listed as a dependent on her stepfather\'s tax returns; she\'s not a dependent of mine. Legally, I\'m not responsible.      [asked by British interviewer Ginny Dougary why so many women had his babies] Well, sometimes -- ughh . . . arghh . . . I . . . I don\'t . . . ahh . . . know why it is that I\'m any more of a sire than anyone else. Um . . . er . . . something to do with the genes, I guess.      When I used to be a contract player in 1954 at Universal, I wasn\'t getting good roles. I was getting one-liners, and then I\'d be gone. But I\'d hang around; I\'d watch guys. And when I had days off, which was most days, I\'d go down and watch other sets while they were shooting. Watch Joan Crawford or whomever. Just watch how they worked and how the director handled them. I didn\'t know anything about making movies, and there\'s a lot to learn.      Secretly everybody\'s getting tired of political correctness, kissing up. That\'s the kiss-ass generation we\'re in right now. We\'re really in a pussy generation. Everybody\'s walking on eggshells. We see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff. When I grew up, those things weren\'t called racist. And then when I did Gran Torino (2008), even my associate said, ""This is a really good script, but it\'s politically incorrect."" And I said, ""Good. Let me read it tonight."" The next morning, I came in and I threw it on his desk and I said, ""We\'re starting this immediately.""      I don\'t know what I am. I\'m a little of everything.      [on Barack Obama] He doesn\'t go to work. He doesn\'t go down to Congress and make a deal. What the hell\'s he doing sitting in the White House? If I were in that job, I\'d get down there and make a deal. Sure, Congress are lazy bastards, but so what? You\'re the top guy. You\'re the president of the company. It\'s your responsibility to make sure everybody does well. It\'s the same with every company in this country, whether it\'s a two-man company or a two-hundred-man company...      You\'re as young as you feel. As young as you want to be. There\'s an old saying I heard from a friend of mine. People ask him, ""Why do you look so good at your age?"" He\'ll say, ""Because I never let the old man in."" And there\'s truth to that. It\'s in your mind, how far you let him come in.      I don\'t have any great pickup lines. I was never an extrovert, so I always had to have someone meet me halfway. If she was interested, we\'d come together, and if not ... When I became a movie actor and became well-known, it took care of itself. Maybe that\'s why I became an actor.      100 years from now and more, people will look back on this generation of films, and the guy who will standout more than anyone else will be Tom Cruise.      What\'s one great thing about a theater is it\'s got an exit.      One of the most important things in life is feeling good about yourself. And when you\'re in decent shape, when you like the way your body looks and feels and your energy levels are at their highest, it\'s a lot easier to feel good about yourself.      I am a junior, and all my younger life I was called Sonny or Junior, and I think a kid deserves his own name.      When I was growing up in the \'30s and \'40s, kids were a lot more active than they are today. We didn\'t have television, we certainly didn\'t have computers, so you came home from school and then went out to play with the other kids in your neighborhood. You didn\'t have to be a varsity athlete to get into a game of pickup basketball or football or to take a bat, ball and glove out to an empty lot for a game of flies-and-grounders.      [on taking nootropics] You can actually feel a difference and see a difference in yourself. I\'m not necessarily interested in extending life. To me, what seems most intriguing is just keeping the quality of your life up as long as fate decrees that you\'ll be here on the planet.      [on the contemporary superhero craze in Hollywood] Thank God that I didn\'t have to do that. [...] I always liked characters that were more grounded in reality. Maybe they do super things or more-than-human things - like Dirty Harry, he has a knack for doing crazy things, or the western guys - but, still, they\'re not caped crusaders.      Follow what you think. You want to do something? Just do it the best you can. Not everyone makes something phenomenal, but at least you can fail on your own terms.      I was a bit of a screw-up, a loner.      I think women like to see other women put down when they\'re out of line. They have a dream of the guy who won\'t let them get away with anything. And the man in the audience is thinking, \'That\'s how I\'d like to handle it--cool and assured, knowing all the answers.\' He wants to be a superhero.      The important thing to remember about women is that they\'re a lot smarter than men and they don\'t play fair.      [asked on the red carpet at The Bridges of Madison County (1995) premiere if he thinks men become sexier with age] That\'s in the eyes of the beholder. I know nothing about how men become sexy because men aren\'t sexy to me, so I really don\'t know.      My appeal is in the characters I play. A superhuman type character who has all the answers, is double cool, exists on his own without society or the help of society\'s police forces. A guy sits in the audience. He\'s twenty-five years old and he\'s scared stiff about what he\'s going to do with his life. He wants to have that self-sufficient thing he sees up on the screen.      I\'m just doing a job, I\'m just in the entertainment business doing the kinds of films that appeal to me. You\'ve got to keep that in perspective. Fame is fleeting.      I think I\'m reasonably intelligent.      [in GQ magazine, October 2011] I don\'t give a fuck about who wants to get married to anybody else! Why not?! We\'re making a big deal out of things we shouldn\'t be making a deal out of ... Just give everybody the chance to have the life they want      I can get into the nostalgia thing sometimes, but to me the good old days are right now.      I am very well mannered, and that, believe it or not, stands me in very good stead.      Marriage is not just about \'love.\' It\'s about \'like\' as well.      The main thing is not how long you\'re on the planet, but the quality you have while you\'re here.      In some ways I know I didn\'t live up to my parents\' hopes. It was a long time before I wanted to go to college--but in some ways I surpassed my parents\' hopes.      I guess I\'m just a bum and a drifter by nature. I don\'t think of myself as a ""star."" I don\'t have any image of myself.      Sometimes I think I disappoint people by not being more like the characters I play in the movies. But who wants to be those guys? The best kind of fan is the one who tells you he loved your film and then, boom, is off.      I\'m in the entertainment business, NOT in the business of trying to shape social opinions.      My dad was always talking about retiring and sitting next to a stream with a couple of beers in his hand. Sounds like a commercial - but it\'s not for me!      I\'m not a person who pre-plans life.      [asked for the secret to a lasting marriage, 1971] We don\'t believe in \'togetherness\'. We\'ve stayed together by staying apart.      For years I bummed around trying to get an acting job. They told me my voice was too soft, my teeth needed capping, I squinted -- all that tearing down of my ego. If I walked into a casting office now, a stranger, I\'d get the same old crap. But now I\'m Clint Eastwood.      [in the early \'70s] I\'m number one at the box office, but Hollywood considers me a bore.      I\'ve always felt that if I examine myself too much, I\'ll find out what I know and don\'t know, and I\'ll burst the bubble. I\'ve gotten so lucky relying on my animal instincts, I\'d rather keep a little bit of the animal alive.      Guys appreciate a man\'s ingenuity to make a buck and have a certain cool. The girls like it too . . . A guy who knows exactly what he wants and goes out and gets it, is reassuring to people.      The less secure a man is, the more likely he is to have extreme prejudice.      I\'ll never win a Best Actor Oscar.

Van Cleef started out as an accountant. He served in the U.S. Navy aboard minesweepers and subchasers during World War II. After the war he worked as an office administrator, becoming involved in amateur theatrics in his spare time. An audition for a professional role led to a touring company job in ""Mr. Roberts"". His performance was seen by Stanley Kramer, who cast him as henchman Jack Colby in High Noon (1952), a role that brought him great recognition despite the fact that he had no dialogue. For the next decade he played a string of memorably villainous characters, primarily in westerns but also in crime dramas such as The Big Combo (1955). His hawk nose and steely, slit eyes seemed destined to keep him always in the realm of heavies, but in the mid-Sergio Leone cast him as the tough but decent Col. Mortimer opposite Clint Eastwood in Per qualche dollaro in pi\xf9 (1965). A new career as a western hero (or at least anti-hero) opened up, and Van Cleef became an international star, though in films of decreasing quality. In the 1980s he moved easily into action and martial-arts movies, and starred in The Master (1984), a TV series featuring almost non-stop martial arts action. He died of a heart attack in December 1989, and was buried at Forest Lawn in the Hollywood Hills.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net>          Spouse (3)               Barbara Havelone          (13 July\xa01976            - 16 December\xa01989)\xa0(his death)                         Joan Marjorie Drane          (9 April\xa01960            - 1974)\xa0(divorced)                         Patsy Ruth Kahle          (10 December\xa01943            - 1960)\xa0(divorced)\xa0(3 children)          Trade Mark (6)        Spaghetti westerns        Sharp facial features        Beady eyes that frequently squinted in the Western sun        Sardonic, menacing characters        Low Authorative voice        When starring in westerns, his characters frequently use customized firearms, such as rifles and pistols with increased precision, fire rate, ammo magazine and additional muzzles.Trivia (16)      He was missing the last joint of his middle finger, a disfigurement prominently featured in the climactic gunfight of Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966). He actually lost it while building a playhouse for his daughter, although there were rumors that it happened in a road accident or a bar fight.      He had three children from his first marriage: Alan (B. 1947), Deborah (B. 1948), and David. In 1960, when Lee married his second wife Joan Miller. They adopted a daughter, Denise.      One episode of his short-lived TV series, The Master (1984), was titled ""The Good, The Bad and the Priceless"".      He had almost given up his acting career in the mid-\'60s and turned to painting when he was cast by Sergio Leone in Per qualche dollaro in pi\xf9 (1965). It made him a superstar in Europe and restarted his career in the US, making him again a recognizable and bankable name.      According to the book ""Weird NJ"" (Sceurman, Mark and Mark Moran, Barnes and Noble Books, 2004 ISBN 0-7607-3979-X) he was a descendant of the Morris County Van Cleefs who were infamous in the area for their strange living and ""procreational"" efforts. In fact, one trait that Lee had was that he had one green eye and one blue eye. According to the book, ""this telltale characteristic was corrected in the movies with colored contact lenses"".      Was the inspiration for the character Revolver Ocelot in the ""Metal Gear"" series of games.      During one summer in the early 1950s he was a camp counselor in NYC for Marc Furstenberg.      Son of Clarence Leroy Van Cleef and Maria Lavinia Van Fleet, both mostly of Dutch ancestry. He also had distant French, Swedish, Belgian (Flemish), English, and German, roots.      Was portrayed as a bounty hunter in the Lucky Luke comic book ""The Bounty Hunter"".      Interviewed in ""Bad at the Bijou"" by William R. Horner (McFarland, 1982).      Was on the short list of actors under consideration for arms dealer Brad Whitaker in The Living Daylights (1987).      He was involved in a car accident in 1959 in which he lost his left kneecap. Doctors told him he would never be able to ride a horse again because of the injury. Within six months he was back in the saddle.      Producer Stuart Cohen recently revealed that Van Cleef was considered for the role of Garry in John Carpenter\'s The Thing (1982), since Carpenter had recently worked with him on Escape from New York (1981).      Served in the US Navy from 1942-46.      When still working as an accountant, Van Cleef was offered an acting job ""starting on Monday."" He protested that he needed to give his employer two weeks\' notice, only to be told that he started on Monday or didn\'t start at all. When Van Cleef\'s employer heard this, he promptly fired him, removing the need for any notice period.      His death certificate gave throat cancer as a secondary cause of death.Personal Quotes (4)      Being born with a pair of beady eyes was the best thing that ever happened to me.

This Mexican desperado\'s wanted poster is not completely unfurled by the gang ambushing him at the beginning of the film, so we cannot be sure for all of what he was wanted (at least by them).However, a partial account of Tuco\'s other known crimes is transcribed below as best known discerned from the dialog of the court officials during a careful viewing of the classic film ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" in which he is just about to be hanged (twice); only to be ""rescued"" by \'The Man with No Name\'* (called ""Blondie"" by Tuco) using his miraculous movies-only possible sharpshooting with a Henry repeating rifle (which also miraculously fires in terrific rapid-fire to affect the \'redemption\' of Tuco):Tuco\'s Crimes Stated During the First ""Hanging"":Tuco was ""wanted in 14 counties of this state, the condemned is found guilty of the crimes of murder; armed robbery of citizens, state banks and post offices; the theft of sacred objects; arson in a state prison; perjury; bigamy; deserting his wife and children; inciting prostitution; kidnapping; extortion; receiving stolen goods; selling stolen goods; passing counterfeit money; and contrary to the laws of this state the condemned is guilty of using marked cards ...

Proceed.""(The shooting starts again, and Tuco is one again \'redeemed\', but since ""it\'s getting harder"", ""Blondie"" dissolves the partnership (it\'s ""untied""). He rides off with the money and generously - albeit smart-assedly - tells Tuco that ""you remain tied"" and ""can keep the rope"".)The two re-form their \'partnership\' to battle ""Angel Eyes"" (""Sentenza"" as masterfully played by Lee van Cleef) and have memorable good times tracking down the $200,000 in gold - Sentenza (\'The Bad\') being not allowed to partake, naturally.Exactly why ""Blondie"" doesn\'t dispatch Tuco and divide the loot with him at the end of the movie for his evidently nefarious life of crime is unknown (except, of course, because ""Blondie"" is \'The Good\'), yet we, the audience liken to the hapless Tuco and invest a passing interest in his well-being, general health and good spirits. And even though ""Blondie"" executes three possibly obstensively innocent men (the 3 bounty hunters) just to get him for himself for the hanging/rope cutting partnership, We get to like \'the Rat\' at least enough to not want to see him killed, even at the famous and story-tidy - yet marvelously high-tension - ""Last Hanging of Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez"" at the end of the film.(And it\'s made obvious to Tuco that anybody as capable as ""Blondie"" would not appreciate being followed to obscond with his \'cut\' of the take.)* In ""For a Fist Full of Dollars"" Clint Eastwood\'s character is referred to as \'Manco\' by a sheriff, but since each trilogy is considered as a separate story with different characters, we never know his real name in the film.""']","[u'Blondie', u'""""The Man with No Name"" is a man of mystery who travels the country on his mule or horse. His usual ventures often involve getting a money reward or helping people. He wears a signature poncho and hat, always smokes cigars, and always carries a revolver with rattle snakes on the grips. Known for his quick draws and aims, he is considered one of the fastest in the West.The Man prefers not to reveal his name. As a result he has gone under a number of nicknames. He was known to some by the nickname Blondie. He has also at least once been referred to as Joe simply because it is a common name. And he has also gone under the name Monco, according to the Sheriff.During the Civil War, The Man (going by the name of \'Blondie\') briefly took advantage of a bounty that was placed on a bandit named Tuco. They arranged for him to be turned in so the reward could be collected. Tuco would then be freed by Blondie and the reward would be split between them. However, this did not go well after the two began double-crossing each other. But they held their partnership, in pursuit of $200,000 in gold buried in Sad Hill Cemetery, while also working against another bounty hunter who was also in pursuit of the buried gold. Eventually, a stand off was held between Blondie, Tuco and the bounty hunter, Angel Eyes. Blondie manages to kill Angel Eyes and split the gold with Tuco.On his arrival to the town of San Miguel, The Man with No Name goes by \'Joe\' and discovers that the town is in a turf war between the Rojos and the Baxters. He ends up releasing a woman, named Marisol, that the Rojo\'s had kept as a hostage. Marisol and her family are able to flee as a result of Joe\'s actions. Joe eventually kills off the Rojos after they\'ve killed the Baxters, ending the dispute.The Man then (going by \'Monco\') worked as a bounty killer, making a living by catching outlaws and turning them into the law. On one such occasion, he was pursuing an outlaw known as El Indio. In order to catch him, he formed a partnership with another gunslinger named Colonel Mortimer. The two of them became good friends, and after an intense gunfight, Mortimer decided to allow the Monco to take the bodies of Indio and his gang and take the entire reward himself.Very little is known about his background or what his real name is, although sometimes he reveals parts of his past. In a conversation with an Alcoholic Union Captain, he claims he hails from Illinois. And when Marisol asked why he helped her, her husband and their child and gave them his money, he replied: ""Why? I knew someone like you once and there was no-one there to help.""Though his personality is an efficient bounty killer, The Man is smart, cunning, and tough as nails. But he also displays a tendency to aid and help other people when he feels obligated, as evident while trying to comfort a dying Confederate soldier, saving and helping Marisol and her family, and assist The Colonel in a fair duel with Indio by loaning his revolver.His plans for the future are revealed to Col. Douglas Mortimer. He says he wants to last much longer than 50 years of age (the age Mortimer has almost reached). ""When I get my hands on Indio and that $10,000, I\'m gonna buy myself a little place. Possibly retire."" From these words one can conclude that his goal is to get rich and when he succeeds his life as a drifter will be over.There has been debate whether Joe, Monco and Blondie are in fact the same person.""']","[u'Angel Eyes', u'""The Bad, a ruthless, unfeeling and sociopathic mercenary named ""Angel Eyes"" (Sentenza - Sentence - in the original script and the Italian version), who always finishes a job he\'s paid for (which is usually finding...and killing people).

Angel Eyes forms a fleeting partnership with Blondie, but Tuco and Blondie turn on Angel Eyes when they get their chance.Originally, Leone wanted Charles Bronson to play Angel Eyes but he had already committed to The Dirty Dozen (1967). Leone thought about working with Lee Van Cleef again: ""I said to myself that Van Cleef had first played a romantic character in For a Few Dollars More.

In a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of\ngood and evil, but it does so in a realistic manner.  Sometimes, crime does\npay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good does go unrewarded. \nThis film probably signaled the death knell of the traditional John Wayne\n`White Hat/Black Hat' Western.<br><br>The three main characters make the film.  Lee Van Cleef (`The Bad') is evil\npersonified.  Totally ruthless, he'll do whatever it takes to get what he\nwants.  Clint Eastwood (`The Good') is the Man With No Name, not really\n`good' in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and\ntries to do the right thing.  (Watch the scene when he gives a dying\nConfederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful, and it sums up\neverything that the Man With No Name is all about, without saying a single\nword.)  Eli Wallach (`The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most complex -\nif not the best - character in the film.  All impulse and rage, Tuco spins\nwildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be Clint\nEastwood's best friend in one scene, trying to kill him in another - Tuco\ntruly represents `the ugly' side of people.<br><br>The movie is long, but there's not a wasted scene in the film.  Each one\nslowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more\nabout each character and what's going on.  The pacing is incredible, as is\nthe direction - Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension\nin the film, keeping the film from ever getting predictable.  Any typical\nWestern clich\xe9 that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist\nor utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling.  Of special mention\nis Ennio Morricone's score, which is absolutely perfect.  Two scenes - one\nin a Union prison camp, one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the\nend of the film - are amazing on their own, but they become absolutely\nastonishing with combined with Morricone's powerful score. <br><br>This movie is absolutely brilliant.  If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly\nurge to do so.  Immediately.  (And then, go watch `Unforgiven' . . . in a\nway, I think that `Unforgiven' is the sequel to `The Good, the Bad, and the\nUgly - it's the story of what eventually happened to the Man With No Name.)\n`The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is easily one of the best Westerns ever\nmade.  A++ \n\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nThis is the third,and arguably the best, of the so-called ""spaghetti\nwestern"" trilogy. It is ironic that, at the time the three Sergio Leone\nwesterns were released, they were largely panned by critics as being\npoor and even laughable imitations of American-made westerns. The fact\nthat they were filmed in Italy and Spain resulted in them receiving\ntheir amusing nickname which was intended to degrade them at the time.<br><br>Somehow, over the quarter century or so since their release, the\ncritics have tended to change their opinions, and now these movies are\ngenerally regarded as classics. Perhaps this is because Clint Eastwood\nwas principally known only as the second banana, Rowdy Yates, in the\ntelevision series ""Rawhide"" when the films were produced but since then\nhas achieved superstardom. But I also think it goes beyond that. I\nbelieve the critics decided to take another look at these films and\nrealized that they had been premature in writing them off. Actually, I\nbelieve the three films were considerably better than most of what\nHollywood produced. In fact, I think that TGTBATU ranks among the best\nwesterns ever produced bringing to mind the magnificent films of John\nFord, the undisputed master of that genre, and his protege, the\nincomparable John Wayne. <br><br>I have nothing but praise for this film. In fact, I rank it as one of\nmy favorite films of all time. I could write volumes of what is good\nabout this film. But since its qualities have been oft repeated in\nother viewer reviews, I will focus on what others didn't like about it.\nMost of the IMDb reviews had only one major complaint: the film is too\nlong. I disagree. In fact, in spite of its nearly three hour length, I\nwas disappointed that it ended. I was so absorbed in the film that I\nwas disheartened to have to return to reality. The combination of\nstory, cinematography, acting and musical score left nothing to be\ndesired other than more of the same! The sequences that seemed to drag\non in the opinion of other reviewers were necessary to fully create\nmoods and to drive home important points. For example, the opening\nsequence might be regarded as needlessly long as Angel Eyes taunts a\nhapless man over a leisurely meal. But to me, scenes like that are what\nmakes the movie great! The time allows the viewer to fully appreciate\nthe amazing replication of the primitive home and the pitiful life of\nits dirt-poor inhabitants. I felt as though I was sitting there at the\ntable; I was half tempted to reach for a bowl and spoon to partake of\nthe meal. And all the while the suspense was building towards the\ninevitable climax. You know it's coming but not when and the length of\nthe scene drives you crazy but makes it all the more satisfying when it\ndoes happen. <br><br>Another example is when Tuco punishes Joe by forcing him to walk\nthrough the desert. This is possibly the only time that one might\nbecome bored with the film. But again, I think the time for the scene\nwas justified in that we are able to receive the full impact of that\nexperience and enjoy the haunting music at the same time. Joe's\nsubsequent predicament might not have had much credibility had this\nsequence been abbreviated. <br><br>In my opinion, one of the essential elements of a great film is\ncreating moods that absorb our attention. This often takes time, lots\nof time. For example, many of the scenes in the magnificent film ""Dr.\nZhivago"" were almost painfully long but they were necessary to create\nthose startling surrealistic moods, and the film would not have been\ngreat without them. In many ways, TGTBATU has this same sort of\ngreatness.

You've got men carrying revolvers that look like\nold style cap-and-ball pistols, but they're loading them with metallic\ncartridges- historically about five years early. Eastwood carries a rifle\nthat hasn't been invented yet, Tuco assembles a ""superpistol"" out of a\nColt,\na Remington, and a Smith and Wesson- impossible. And there was nothing of\nmerit taking place between the North and South during the Civil War in the\nSouthwest.\nNow, that aside, I must say that this is the Greatest western ever. I\nfirst\nsaw this film when I was about ten. I'd never sat through an entire\nWestern\nbefor, even though my Dad watched them constantly. Since then, I've been\nthrough film school, watched hundreds of Westerns, learned to appreciate\nthem- but NOTHING matches up to this. The Searchers, Stagecoach, Gunfight\nat\nthe O.K. Corral, The Gunfighter, High Noon, Shane- all great films, but\nsaddled with the standard American Western morality- the good guy never\ntakes liberties with the eastern schoolmarm, the bad guy wears a black\nhat,\netc. Coming from Italy, TG,TB &amp;TU isn't bound by these conventions.\nBlondie's the ""good guy""- but he's also a bounty hunter. He makes a living\nin a highly immoral way, but is obviously the ""good""- not because we're\ntold, but from small acts- giving the dying soldier a cigar, making sure\nthe\nCaptain knows to hold on till he hears the bridge blow, the genuine regret\nhe feel for having to let Shorty die. And while Angel Eyes may be the Bad,\nwe at least know he has prinicpals- when he's hired for a job, he always\nsees the job through. And Tuco may be more immoral than the other two, but\nhe's so savvy and his role so humorous that one can't bring oneself to\nlook\nupon him disfavorably.\nIn other words, historical inaccuracies aside, TG, TB, &amp; TU maybe one of\nthe\nmost accurate portrayals of the West ever put on film- there are no\nclear-cut lines of conduct, no black and white, or even grey, but just a\nswirled palette of various facets of the human condition.\n</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nI wasn't sure if I was going to comment on this film because everything\nhas already been said by the hundreds of other people who have posted\ntheir thoughts, but I decided that I should really put my two cents in\nsince this is my favorite movie.<br><br>This film, in my opinion, is not only the greatest spaghetti western of\nall time. It is the greatest movie of all time. Period. Regardless of\ngenre. I could probably watch it every day, and be perfectly happy\ndoing so.<br><br>The music is perfection. The way the music drives this movie is\nabsolutely amazing. The musical genius of Morricone and the incredible\ndirection of Sergio Leone is a combination that will probably never be\nequaled. The theme song will forever be etched in your brain. In fact,\nit probably already is, even if you haven't seen the movie! The scene\nwhere Tuco runs through the graveyard with the song ""Ecstacy of Gold""\nis pure poetry. And the showdown at the end with that great music- just\nincredible.<br><br>The story is riveting. There is not a single dull moment. The movie is\nlong, but Leone's direction is so good that you will love the fact that\nyou can enjoy this movie for three hours.<br><br>Lee Van Cleef is my favorite spaghetti western actor, and he is\nincredible as ""Angel Eyes."" It is the part he was born to play. Eli\nWallach is perfect as Tuco. He really shines in this movie. Some people\nsay he steals the show, and I can see why they think so. Eastwood is\nexcellent as ""Blondie,"" although I don't think Eastwood has as strong\nof a presence as Van Cleef (I know many will disagree, and that's OK\nbecause all three actors are superb in this film so why split hairs?).<br><br>This movie is hypnotic. It's operatic. It's sad. It's funny. It's\ngritty. It's violent. It's art. It's action. It's pure entertainment.\nThe film is just so incredible on so many different levels that\nEVERYONE should see it, regardless of what kinds of movies they are\ninto. And it's so cool that the greatest flick ever just happens to be\na spaghetti western.

It all seemed very macho and self-consciously cool, and it had\nobviously inspired all the overrated macho directors I don't like in my\nown generation - Tarantino, for example, and Robert Rodriguez. In\nshort, I was unimpressed.<br><br>Years later, I gave the film a second shot, watching it all the way\nthrough this time. I loved it. What had changed? <br><br>For one thing, I took more notice of the technical side of the film. I\npaid attention to Leone's famous use of close-ups, his selection of\nmemorable character actors, and his wonderful scene-setting. I admired\nthe detailed sets and the sweeping landscapes, the props and the\ncostumes and all those weird, wonderful faces that Leone clearly loved\nto photograph.<br><br>I also got hooked by some of the quieter moments that I had skipped\nover in my first viewing. One of the most effective scenes involves Eli\nWallach's character, Tuco, quarreling with his brother when they meet\nafter they've been apart for years. Their argument is great,\nemotionally charged stuff, made all the more effective by the\nsuggestion that they really do love and care about each other. It's the\nkind of sensitive, human scene you never get to see in a Tarantino or\nRodriguez movie.<br><br>Before I get too fuzzy-wuzzy, I should also like to point out that, on\nmy second viewing, I LOVED all the action, too. Every gunfight is\ngreat, in its own way, and they're all a bit different. The greatest of\nthem all is, of course, the final confrontation between the trio, which\nis accompanied by some of the most rousing music I've ever heard in a\nfilm. And hey, there's even a huge Civil War battle to provide a change\nof pace from all the small-scale action.<br><br>Ultimately, ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is probably just a\npotboiler of a film, without too much to say about, for example, the\nhuman condition. But what a potboiler! It doesn't have to try to be\ncool - it simply IS cool. In fact, it probably defined heroic coolness\nfor an entire generation. Eli Wallach's performance, Leone's direction\nand Morricone's music alone are enough to elevate it to classic status\n- and the fact that everything else in the movie is great, too, helps\nelevate it to the level of perhaps the greatest action film ever made.<br><br>And to think, I missed all that the first time through...\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nThis film probably had the largest impact on my life. It set the tone for\neverything I then got interested in. American Civil War. Film Music. Clint\nEastwood. Real Westerns.

It has drama, comedy, cracking\ndialogue, some of the most brutal battle scenes - especially around the\nbridge - that I'd seen up to then, music to die for and set pieces that just\nooze atmosphere and tension.

How do I remember a baseball game, it was the\nnight Hank Aaron was going after Babe Ruth's\nhomerun record. Baseball or a movie. Tuned into the\nthe baseball game, flipped to the movie -a western, cool.\n'Uh, what is this no one is talking it makes no sense'. After what seemed\nlike an eternity somebody finally spoke, Lee van Cleef. The rest is Movie\nHistory. Since then I have seen this movie well over 25\ntimes.\nNumerous lines that have been etched into my memory.\nForget whatever minor flaws this movie has. Put yourself\nin the movie. Sergio Leon, John Ford these are the people\nthat\ndefined ""The Western"". On a scale of 1-10, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\nis nothing less than a 10. Plop the tape into the VCR, sit back and\nexperience a classic.\n\n</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n...and though those last several words could also be attributed to\nLeone's ""Once Upon a Time"" films (West and America) as well as the\nother pieces in his trilogy of films with Clint Eastwood- Fistful of\nDollars and For a Few More Dollars- arguably this is the most ambitious\nand spellbinding one of the bunch, and one that has inspired (i.e.\nQuentin Tarantino, Sam Raimi, Robert Rodriguez) and will most likely\ncontinue to inspire filmmakers and fans into the 21st century. There's\nsomething in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly that's nearly (or perhaps\nis) mythical in it's craft, certain scenes come off as being more than\nrelevant and exquisite for that scene/sequence- it transcends into\naspects of humanity.<br><br>For example, in the first part of the film (this is after the\nextraordinary introductions to Tuco, played by Eli Wallach, Sentenza or\n'Angel Eyes', played by Lee Van Cleef, and as Blondie by a 35/36 year\nold Clint), Joe gets Tuco out of a hanging, which is something of a\nregular practice for them, but Joe decides to leave his 'buddy' out in\nthe desert to walk the rest of the way back into town. A little later,\nthe situation gets reversed, as Tuco has a horse and water and Joe\ndoesn't, and they both go to cross the desert. Leone decides to not\nfollow Tuco coming back to town as much as he follows in earnest Tuco\nand Joe going across that desert, as Joe starts to burn and dry up,\ngoing towards a story that will soon unfold. There is something to\nthese scenes that I can barely describe, that they're executed in the\nmind-set of a Western, but in the abstract Leone lets the audience know\nthis is a story that is bold and bigger than life.<br><br>What makes much of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly such a huge success\nis the trust Leone had in his own style he spun into his own after the\nfirst two westerns, his trust in his collaborators, and in his leading\nplayers as well. I, for one, had to mistakenly figure out that it is\nnear depressing to watch this film on a regular VCR tape due to the pan\n&amp; scan process. There is such a clear, distinct visual scope that Leone\nand camera director Tonino Delli Colli achieve that it's practically a\nmust to get the DVD (preferably the extended version, which was Leone's\noriginal cut more or less). The editing, too, is unique in many\nsequences (the climax is the most noted and memorable). The score, with\nusual collaborator Ennio Morricone, is one of the landmark movie\nscores, and themes, of not just in the western genre but in all movie\nhistory. <br><br>And the three main players who take on the screen have their own chops\nto show off: Eastwood, technically, was playing a Joe that took place\nbefore Fistful of Dollars, yet by this film had it down to a T (it's\nstill my favorite performance from him, despite having few words and\nreactions); Cleef's cold, cunning Angel Eyes steals the scenes he's in;\nditto for Wallach, who gets under the skin of his co-patriots as much\nas he sometimes does under the viewer's. If anyone really stays in the\nmind, at least for me, it's Wallach - especially as he gets the most\n'character', and one of the very best scenes is between Tuco and his\nreligious brother. Without that scene, the movie actually wouldn't work\nquite as well, surprisingly enough. <br><br>Overall, The Good, the Bad and Ugly, is an entirely satisfying western,\nat least one of my five favorites ever made, and it's an endearing\nbravo to all who were involved.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><a href=""reviews-enter"">Add another review</a></p>>], [<bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nSergio Leone's film follows the adventures of 3 ruthless outlaws...<br><br>The 'Good' is Eastwood's unchanging and unshaven 'Stranger With No\nName.'

In fact their brilliant\nportrayals have immortalized Blondie, Sentenza/ Angel Eyes and the\nenigmatic Tuco. Lee Van Cleef is fiendishly unforgiving as the\nmerciless Angel Eyes. Clint Eastwood is rugged yet suave, cocky yet\nadorable as laconic cigar-smoker Blondie, a role that laid the\nfoundations of his illustrious career. But it is Eli Wallach, who\nsteals the show with his captivating portrayal of Tuco, a portrayal\nthat is as entrancing as it is enlightening.

And this was the best.<br><br>That I so enjoyed this movie so much came as a shock to me. I literally\nnever before have been able to even sit through a western, which (in my\nadmittedly limited experience) was schlock action starring John Wayne\nas the taciturn all-American good guy being tough and beating up the\noutlaws. Watching GBU, I was enthralled for the entire three hours.\nTwice. And if I had time, I would have watched it a third time. <br><br>The setting is typically western: a dry, dusty panorama in which men\nbarely co-exist with each other; few wasted words; and lots of action,\nhorses, and gunfighting in a wild west barely governed by incipient\ninstitutions of law &amp; order \x96 all shrouded within a morality play of\ngood vs. bad. But what I liked so much is exactly what I hate about\nJohn Wayne westerns \x96 the seriousness and honesty with which moral\ncontext is considered. In Hollywood, good vs. bad is as thoughtlessly\nsuperscripted as the protagonists' white and black hats. In GBU every\nremnant of moralizing has been ruthlessly cut.<br><br>Good, Bad, and Ugly are personified in the form of three characters:\nBad (""Sentenza"") is the easiest to understand. He is *very* bad,\nperhaps not so different from other villains, but much more sharply\ndeveloped; murderous, sadistic, traitorous, and remorseless. Good\n(""Blondie"") and Ugly (""Tuco"") are more puzzling, but their labels are\nthe key to the movie. Both Blondie and Tuco are outlaws and killers\nwith only the barest hint of morality, but they're not evil in the same\nway that Sentenza is. Tuco is demonstrative, emotional, loud, wild, and\nunpredictable; but driven by survival rather than satanic urges.\nBlondie is cool, calm, rational and controlled \x96 in many ways similar\nto Sentenza \x96 but whereas Sentenza tortures, maims, kills, and lies for\nthe hell of it, even apparently enjoys it, Blondie simply goes about\nhis business coolly, and shows several poignant hints of empathy,\ndecency, and a sense of justice.<br><br>GBU takes place during the Civil War and strips away the high-level\npolitical struggle of history books, leaving us with the soldier's\nvantage point of brutality, pointless death, and some individual\ndecency. The politics are indecipherable from this vantage point. GBU\nhits this point home when our protagonists wind up in a prison camp\nbecause the oncoming gray cavalry uniforms turn out to be dust-covered\nblue. Later, they encounter an army fighting over a worthless bridge,\nsuffering countless pointless deaths and casualties. Because Leone has\nso rigorously excised traditional off-the-shelf morality, the few\ninstances of humanity are remarkably poignant. One such instance is\nwhen Blondie shares his coat and cigar with a dying soldier; another is\nwhen prisoners are forced \x96 by Sentenza's orders \x96 to play music to\ncover up the screams of the tortured. Sentenza apparently enjoyed the\nirony of beautiful sounds used for such ends; the musicians are, of\ncourse, pained by it.<br><br>That was one of many extraordinarily striking scenes. The honesty of\nthe moral context was what I liked best about the film, but I liked\neverything else too. Indeed the same primal, ruthless honesty that\ncharacterizes the character development pervades the film. The music is\nunlike anything I'd ever heard \x96 it's an audible version of the arid\nwest and the tensions and lawlessness that characterize the film.\nUnderlying the entire score is one instantly memorable theme starting\noff with what sounds like a screaming hyena. The story took place in\nNew Mexico, and even though it was filmed in Spain, it really does look\nlike New Mexico; and just as in life in the American west, the wide,\nbreathtaking panorama tends to subordinates dialog. Indeed, it is\nseveral minutes into the film before even one word is spoken.<br><br>The plot was extremely clever \x96 and never predictable. High level\nsuspense is maintained for the full three hours. It was hard to imagine\nhow it could unfold \x96 three uncompromising outlaws in search of one\nburied treasure; cooperation was not in their nature, but nothing was\never done out of character. Any Western clich\xe9 that you can think of is\neither given a unique twist or destroyed by masterful storytelling. For\nexample there is an utterly irreverent scene in which Tuco meets his\nbrother, a sincere Priest, and turns platitudes upside down. The\nbrother begins with the standard rebuke of the criminal's behavior, but\nTuco punches back and says, ""Where we come from there were only two\nways out. You lacked the courage to do what I've done."" The movie is\nalso irreverently funny: For example, Twice Tuco gained the upper hand\non Blondie and said:<br><br>""There are two kinds of spurs(?), my friend. Those that come in by the\ndoor, and (crosses himself) those that come in by the window.""<br><br>""There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. Those who have\na rope around their neck and those who have the job of cutting."" Later\nBlondie gained the advantage of Tuco and observed: <br><br>""You see in this world there's two kinds of people my friend - those\nwith loaded guns, and those who dig. You dig."" In addition to all these\nspecific attributes, a unique and strikingly cool style infuses the\nentire film: long scenes of tense silences \x96 never for an instant\nboring; and telling, startling close-ups and transitions. Most\nnoteworthy was the film's climax. As the protagonists stand there with\ntheir fingers on their holsters, waiting for the first person to go for\ntheir gun(s), the transitions start out slowly, and speed up as the\ntension increases. As I write this, I wish I had my own copy of the\nfilm, just so I could see this scene again.<br><br>Not just a great western, but easily one of the best movies of *any*\nkind ever made.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nBelfast-based comics writer Garth Ennis said it best: ""There are two kinds\nof people in the world, my friend...those who dig Clint Eastwood\nmovies...and dweebs."" While I have to admit that my heart belongs to the\nopening act of ""The Man With No Name"" trilogy, ""A Fistful of Dollars"",\nthere\nis no denial in my mind that ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is actually\nthe better film. Many directors have tried imitating it's style (including\nDon Siegel's substandard ""Hang 'Em High"" and Eastwood's own first Western\noffering as star/director in ""High Plains Drifter""), but none have truly\ncome close to the eccentricities on display here.<br><br>I have a suspicion that the storyline is actually based on historical\nfact.\nConsider this account from Joel Rose's ""The Big Book of Thugs"" under the\nentry of ""The Reynolds Gang"": They were organized in 1863 by Texans Jim\nand\nJohn Reynolds. They were briefly interned in a Civil War prison camp for\nConfederate sympathizers and after being released, began making robberies\nthat, according to Jim Reynolds, were to help out Jefferson Davis and the\nConfederacy. The loot was buried somewhere in the area of Handcart Gulch\nand\nSpanish Peaks in Colarado Territory and later, after Jim Reynolds and four\nmembers of his gang had been executed by Colonel John M. Chivington of the\nUnion Army, John Reynolds, dying from a fatal wound during a holdup,\nsupposedly whispered out the location of his old gang's ill gotten loot.\nUnlike the movie version, it was never found.<br><br>Regardless of whether or not this was the actual basis for TGTBATU, it is\nnevertheless a film more grounded in history than a lot of it's\ncomtemparies\nand, indeed, more than a few of it's successors. The Civil War is part of\nthe backdrop, but it does so on a forgotten front of that war, the Western\ntheater. Most high-school history classes would have us believe that\nnothing\nhappened out West, but plenty did. In fact, the last skirmish of the war,\nif\nI'm not mistaken, was in New Mexico and, ironically enough, a Confederate\nvictory.<br><br>The central of this film is greed. You don't just see it in the quest for\nthe Confederate gold by Blondie, Angel Eyes, and Tuco. There are signs of\nit\neverywhere; in the hotel manager talking about how he'll be glad to get\nthe\nNortherners in town for the money they'll bring in, Bill Carson appealing\nto\nTuco's greed for a single sip of water, the gang of cutthroats who are\nsystematically robbing the Confederate prisoners of their goods. Set up\nagainst the harsh desert backdrop, it exposes the ultimate folly of that\ngreed (the best symbol of it perhaps being the cemetary where the gold is\nburied). A little over a decade before the Reagan era of ""Greed is\nhealthy,\ngreed is good"", this film provides the ultimate rebuttal to that argument.\nGreed has gotten just as many men killed, if not more, than patriotism\never\ndid. Such a subtext makes ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" the cinematic\nchild of John Huston's ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" and the precursor to\nOliver Stone's ""Wall Street"".<br><br>As great as Leone, Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach are, there is one\nmember\nof this team that pushs this film into the status of greatness: score\nwriter\nEnnio Morricone. Not only does he manage to write one of the most\nrecognized\ntheme tunes on the planet, he also adds the extra tension needed to convey\nthe drama with the necessary oomph, the best examples being in Blondie's\ntorturous walk across the desert, Tuco's frantic search through the\ncemetary\n(my personal favorite and so good that Lucasarts did a slowed-down version\nof it for their western shooter, ""Outlaws""), and, of course, the final\nthree\nway shoot-out. He still composes scores for many other films to this day,\nI've been told. A good example of his most recent work would be the 1990\nversion of ""Hamlet"" starring Mel Gibson and directed by Franco Zefferelli.\nBut I truly doubt that he'll ever be able to top the legendary work he did\nhere.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nSergio Leone is arguably the most visionary director of all time. They\nsay\nthat before he even had a written script he could picture exactly what\nwas\nto be on screen and the camera's direction in leading his characters. It\nwas\nSergio's World - an alternate place in an alternate time that he was free\nto\ncontrol. He controlled the audience and his story like no other director.<br><br>To me, his best film was the one that was on many critics' ten worst\nfilms\nof 1984 list: ""Once Upon a Time in America."" I love the finished\ndirector's\ncut, the cut of the film Sergio Leone himself wanted and pictured in his\nmind while filming the movie. Unfortunately, the editor of the film cut\neverything into a two-hour picture and messed up the timeline for the\ntheatrical release in 1984 - the result was a disastrous motion picture\nthat\nnow, with the director's cut, stands as one of the best of all time.\nJames\nWoods once said that one of the critics who named it the worst film of\n1984\nlater named it the best film of the decade.<br><br>""Once Upon a Time in America"" was Sergio's dream project, one that took\nhim\nten years to get on the big screen and ultimately killed him by sucking\nthe\nlife out of him, but ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (1967) was\nundoubtably\nhis most visual film. The extreme close-ups, the great way he lets the\naudience see nothing but what he wants - as far as he saw it, the\naudience\nshould not wonder what is off-screen; whatever is within the frames is\nall\nthere is. Compared to ""Once Upon a Time"" it seems a bit more corny and\nunrealistic - but it is a spaghetti western, and that is simply the\npoint.\nIt stands above the rest as the best spaghetti western of them\nall.<br><br>Leone is best remembered for his extreme close-ups. Director Quentin\nTarantino once said, among many other things about Leone, his role model,\nthat when he started out he knew not many camera directions, so when he\nwanted an extreme close-up in a film he'd shout, ""I want a Sergio Leone\non\nthis guy!"" Quentin Tarantino has such a respect for Leone that he even\nsuggested the title ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" to director Robert\nRodriguez, the title, of course, a derivation on ""Once Upon a Time in the\nWest"" and ""Once Upon a Time in America,"" both films of Sergio\nLeone.<br><br>""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" a.k.a. ""Buono, il bruto, il cattivo,\nil,""\nis the final film in the Dollars Trilogy - ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" ""For a\nFew Dollars More,"" and, of course, ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" I\nhave\nyet to see this film's predecessors, but I doubt they are much better\nthan\nthis film. It isn't really about anything per se - it's a showcase of art\nand camera techniques. It is a showcase for Sergio Leone and a great one\nat\nthat. I have no real care about the themes or outcomes - I simply enjoy\nbeing controlled by a masterful director such as Leone. When there's a\ndirector who can literally push in and give the audience specifically\nwhat\nhe wants them to see, without the audience feeling cheated, you know you\nhave a great director, because there's a fine line between a selfish\ndirector and a visionary director. Leone has a bit of both, so indistinct\nthat it is hard to notice. The same thing was done in Carol Reed's ""The\nThird Man"" (1949), and the same is done here. And it is pulled off\nwithout\nany objections from the audience.<br><br>Clint Eastwood is The Good - he rides around the desert kidnapping\ncriminals, giving them to the authorities and claiming reward money, and\nthen freeing the criminals before they are to be hanged. He meets Tuco\n(Eli\nWallach), a.k.a. The Ugly, and does his routine - but The Ugly fights\nback\nand, ultimately, kidnaps good ol' Clint, taking him into the desert and\npractically torturing him in the heat.<br><br>Then The Good overhears where a stash of gold is hidden from a dying man.\nThe Ugly wants the gold so much that he nurses The Good back to health so\nthat they can go off on a wild goose chase and search for the treasure.\nBut\nthere is already another man searching for the treasure - Angel Eyes,\na.k.a.\nThe Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a man whose skills at gunfighting match those of\nThe Good, a true marksman if ever there was such a thing.<br><br>There's a terrific scene towards the end of ""The Good, the Bad and the\nUgly,"" where three men have found the gold buried in a graveyard. At\nexactly\nthe same time. They each have guns pointed at each other. They could all\npull their triggers and die, or kill one of the three and the two could\nthen\ntake the money and split it. Leone zooms in with his extreme close-ups\nand\ntruly gives the audience a sense of paranoia, a sense of what it would\nfeel\nlike in a circumstance such as that. Sergio Leone is a great director,\nperhaps the most visionary of all time, and now that his films are\nturning\nup again with their intended running times, the realization strikes and\nsinks in.<br><br>He's an even better director than we thought he was.<br><br>5/5 stars -<br><br>John Ulmer\n\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nSergio Leone always wanted every picture he made to be, in every way,\nbigger than the one which preceded it. With the Good, the Bad and the\nUgly he continued his upward trajectory and rounded off his dollars\ntrilogy in style.<br><br>This picture was Leone's most stylised and grandiose to date, and\nbrought all the themes and styles he had been developing in his\nearliest films to perfection. Among the most notable was his\ncharacterisation, particularly his all-important introductions of\ncharacters. Look at the introductory scenes of the three leads. We\nfirst see Tuco bursting out of a window, obviously interrupted in the\nmiddle of a meal, and straight away we get his freeze-frame and the\ntitle ""the ugly"" \x96 this is a simple character, and needs no further\nintroduction. Angeleyes appears out of the distance, but grows towards\nus until his face fills the screen. We see him commit two despicable\nacts of murder and treachery before we get his freeze-frame and title\n""the bad"", telling us he is pure evil. Finally, in Blondie's first\nappearance he steps into the frame from behind the camera, as if he had\nalways been there. He rescues Tuco, but only for his own profit. It's\nnot until we have seen him betray and abandon Tuco that we get his\nfreeze-frame and title ""the good"" \x96 obviously a fairly ironic label\ngiven the way he has just acted.<br><br>Leone's trademark long drawn out face-offs \x96 exaggerated versions of\nthe shootouts of John Ford westerns and the sword duels of Kurosawa's\nsamurai films \x96 are also brought to a peak here. Not only are they now\ntaken to absurd heights of stylisation, they are also spread out and\nadapted to cover the whole picture, until the point where even two men\nsitting opposite each other eating a meal and glancing suspiciously at\none another is treated like another stand off. In fact, the entire film\ncan be considered one long series of duels.<br><br>We also see more of the importance Leone attaches to church and family.\nThe Dollars trilogy could be thought to lack emotion, taking place as\nit does in a world where there are no morals and everyone is out for\ngold. However the Good, the Bad and the Ugly contains several moments\nof poignancy, perhaps the most prominent of which is when Tuco\nconfronts his estranged priest brother.<br><br>Religious iconography and references crops up time and again. Leone\nloved biblical epics almost as much as he loved westerns, and there is\nsomething of the feel of those pictures here in the overwhelming\nlandscapes and eerie, choral music. On top of this the central trio can\nbe read as an allegory for God, the Devil and humanity. This arguably\npresents rather a cynical view of the Catholic faith \x96 given the\ntreacherous and chequered nature of the ""good"" \x96 but it could be argued\nto be a typically Italian one. In a country in which the church is so\nomnipresent and universally accepted, it's sometimes said that God is\ncursed as much as loved. Having said that, this was clearly never\nintended as the central theme \x96 Leone wasn't trying to make some grand\nstatement here \x96 it's simply part of the mix of ideas going on in this\npicture.<br><br>This brings me onto the war theme. Anti-war sentiments are not directly\naddressed in this picture, but the way the civil war is woven into the\nplot makes a powerful statement. For the first half hour we don't see\nthat the war is going on. The central characters aren't concerned with\nthe it \x96 they are only interested in hunting down the gold. However the\nwar encroaches on the plot more and more often, until it moves from\nbackground to foreground and takes over the entire picture, culminating\nin a colossal battle scene. And of course the fact that the film ends\nin a huge military graveyard is also very significant.<br><br>I've spent so long talking about the themes and ideas going on in this\nfilm I've nearly run out of space to talk about all the genius that has\ngone into making it so enjoyable. The dialogue is superb, often funny\nand plenty of it quotable. Technically Leone has perfected his art \x96 he\ncomposes a shot like John Ford, edits like Eisenstein, paces like\nKurosawa, but all with a degree of his own originality. There is\nbrilliant acting \x96 Eli Wallach steals it as Tuco, probably his best\never performance. It's funny how Lee Van Cleef was cast as a villain\nhere. Van Cleef's early career mostly involved playing mean-looking\ngang members, but as Leone discovered when casting him as the hero in\nFor a Few Dollars More, while his face said ""bad guy"" his voice and\nmanner could be warm and likable. The good guy Van Cleef obviously\nproved more popular, as in the dozen or so other spaghetti westerns he\nmade for other directors he was invariably cast as the hero.<br><br>Just time for a final word on the recent (2003) restored edition. While\nit's great that several lost scenes have been added, I have to say that\nvery few of them were entirely necessary. The only one of the added\nscenes I really like is the one in which Angeleyes visits the field\nhospital \x96 it keeps his story arc going, and also shows an act of\ncompassion from the ""bad"" when he lets the soldier keep the bottle.\nHowever the new dubbing for these scenes, strange as it may seem\nconsidering today's technology, is mixed absolutely atrociously. On top\nof this, Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach are now so elderly, they\nactually sound less convincing than the guy impersonating the late Lee\nVan Cleef. As a result the restored segments stick out like sore\nthumbs, and break up the flow of what is in every other way a perfect\nmotion picture.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nOne of the original Leone ""Italian Westerns"" that quickened the pulse\nof a young Quentin Tarantino.<br><br>Sometimes I think I am living in a time warp.

Now in the far future (2016) I watch QT do his knock-offs,\nand the young audiences (who have never seen the originals) think his\nare the originals, and everything else the knockoffs.<br><br>(Reminds me of the Old King Cole nursery rhyme -- ""pulled out a plum\nand said What a Good Boy Am I"" -- another reference lost on those\nliving the age of portable devices.) <br><br>For those who actually care about the history of film: <br><br>* Leone invented a brand new genre called the Italian western. His\nfirst, Fistful of Dollars, recycled a Japanese story (Yojimbo),\nrecycled an American ex-pat whose Hollywood career was officially over\n(Eastwood) and introduced one of the greatest music composers of the\nmodern film era, Ennio Morricone.<br><br>* next came For a Few Dollars More, an original story, which locked\ninto film history Leone's trademark use of closeups and sound editing,\nand brought out of mothballs Lee Van Cleef, one of the greatest ""faces""\nin the history of the western. (""Angel Eyes"" in this one.) <br><br>* with two international hits under his belt, Leone aimed for the stars\nand created this movie which marks his legacy. While simultaneously\ncontinuing the tradition he started, and using the two stars from his\nsecond film, he gave Eli Wallach (an A-list star from the 1950s) the\nrole of his career. Wait there is more. He set the story against the\nbackdrop of the Civil War and manged to make the transitions seamless\nand brutally compelling. it is simultaneously a violent film and an\nanti-war film at the same time! (The only film of Leone's that may\ncompete with this one is Once Upon a Time in America, also reviewed by\nthis writer on the IMDb).<br><br>By modern standards the film is overlong and, had it been produced in\nAmerica (as was indeed the case with Upon a Time in America), the\n""suits"" would have butchered it down to 100 minutes. Luckily for the\nrest of us, this was an international release, cut-proof, and survives\nvery nicely to the present day in its original form.<br><br>QT was a young lad when these films appeared but the impact is clear.\nHe used Morricone's music in Kill Bill (his best film in my view) and\nin my view The Hateful Eight tries to emulate the power of Leone but\nfalls somewhat short.<br><br>For you youngsters out there, I recommend these films as some of the\nmost entertaining efforts ever set to film, period. Imitated but not\nduplicated.<br><br>Astonishing, mind-blowing, unforgettable.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nI know some movie fans who consider The Good, the Bad and the Ugly the\nbest movie ever made. While I don't even think it's the best thing\nSergio Leone made, it's a solid Spaghetti Western that has all but\ntranscended the sub-genre. There are images, such as Clint Eastwood in\nthe poncho, and music, like the main title theme, that are known by\npeople who have never seen the movie. I also know people who wouldn't\nbe caught dead watching a movie made outside of the USA who love The\nGood, the Bad and the Ugly. I can't think of another Italian made film,\nlet alone an Italian made Western, that has become so universally known\nand enjoyed.<br><br>There are so many moments in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly that I\nenjoy. One of my favorites is that of Tuco running through the cemetery\nas Morricone's ""The Ecstasy of Gold"" plays in the background. It\nliterally gives me goosebumps. It's one of those movie moments that I\nlook forward to no matter how many times I've seen them. I'm also a fan\nof the techniques Leone used in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Leone's\nuse of the widescreen shots of the landscape inter-cut with extreme\nclose-ups of faces is brilliant. It adds a sense of intimacy to\nvastness of the setting that allows the viewer feel like they're part\nthe movie and gain some insight into the characters. It's a technique\nthat very few other filmmakers have the guts to employ.<br><br>But I sincerely doubt that Leone's film would be so widely and wildly\nregarded if it weren't for the music of Ennio Morricone. I've already\nmentioned the main title theme and ""The Ecstasy of Gold"", but these are\nonly two examples found in this amazing score. Can you imagine the\nfinal showdown without Morricone's music? I can't think of many\ninstances where music and film go together to create such tension and\nanticipation. I've already used the word ""brilliant"" to describe Leone,\nbut it's also applicable to Morricone.<br><br>Finally, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly wouldn't be the same without\nthe three lead actors. Each, at least in this movie, is brilliant\n(there's that word again) in his own right. Clint Eastwood is ""The\nGood"". He's ""The Good"" in the sense that he's not as ""bad"" as the other\ntwo. Lee Van Cleef is ""The Bad"". He's a ruthless killer who would just\nas soon shoot you as look at you \x96 as long as the price was right. And\nthen there's Eli Wallach as ""The Ugly"". As good as Eastwood and Van\nCleef are, Wallach is really something special. Wallach's Tuco is one\nof the most crazed, but complicated characters I've seen. It's a\nspecial cast for a very special movie.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><a href=""reviews-enter"">Add another review</a></p>>]]"

His father, Edward Mower Norton, Jr., was an environmental lawyer and conservationist, who works for the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Edward has two younger siblings, James and Molly.From the age of five onward, the Yale graduate (majoring in history) was interested in acting. At the age of eight, he would ask his drama teacher what his motivation in a scene was. He attended theater schools throughout his life, and eventually managed to find work on stage in New York as a member of the Signature players, who produced the works of playwright and director Edward Albee. Around the time when he was appearing in Albee\'s Fragments, in Hollywood, they were looking for a young actor to star opposite Richard Gere in a new courtroom thriller, Primal Fear (1996). The role was offered to Leonardo DiCaprio but he turned it down. Gere was on the verge of walking away from the project, fed up with the wait for a young star to be found, when Edward auditioned and won the role over 2000 other hopefuls. Before the film was even released, his test screenings for the part were causing a Hollywood sensation, and he was soon offered roles in Woody Allen\'s Everyone Says I Love You (1996) and The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996). Edward won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Primal Fear (1996). In 1998, Norton gained 30 pounds of muscle and transformed his look into that of a monstrous skinhead for his role as a violent white supremacist in American History X (1998). This performance earned him his second Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actor.He received his third Oscar nomination, for Best Supporting Actor, for his work in Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014). His most prominent roles also include the critically acclaimed Everyone Says I Love You (1996), The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), Fight Club (1999), Red Dragon (2002), 25th Hour (2002), Kingdom of Heaven (2005), The Illusionist (2006), Moonrise Kingdom (2012), and The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). He has also directed and co-written films, including his directorial debut, Keeping the Faith (2000). He has done uncredited work on the scripts for The Score (2001), Frida (2002), and The Incredible Hulk (2008).Alongside his work in cinema, Norton is an environmental and social activist, and is a member of the board of trustees of Enterprise Community Partners, a non-profit organization for developing affordable housing founded by his grandfather James Rouse.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       TrendEkiD@aol.com and Pedro Borges          Spouse (1) Shauna Robertson (April 2012            - present)\xa0(1 child)          Trade Mark (3)        Known to play characters who have dual personalities        Often plays intelligent but troubled characters        Distinctive voiceTrivia (72)      Following graduation, he worked in Osaka, Japan, consulting for his grandfather\'s company, Enterprise Foundation, which works to create decent, affordable housing for low-income families.      On his return to New York, it took less than two years of waiting tables before the young thespian to capture the eye of Edward Albee, one of the most celebrated playwrights of the 20th century. Albee was working with the Signature Theater Company on a new production of Fragments. One audition and Norton landed the role, as well as a slot in Signature\'s repertory company. He currently serves on its board of directors.      He played guitar with Courtney Love\'s band, Hole, in two gigs in Los Angeles, in December 1998.      In July 1998, after a New Yorker jibe in a review of a documentary about Courtney Love, Norton sent the magazine a frameable letter. Norton\'s missive was in response to Endless Love, a piece by Daphne Merkin centering on Nick Broomfield\'s controversial documentary Kurt & Courtney (1998). The film, filled with speculation that Love\'s husband Kurt Cobain\'s death was murder rather than suicide, features a litany of Love-haters anxious to air their grievances. The magazine\'s coverage of Broomfield\'s film ""along with Merkin\'s thoughtful contributions"" didn\'t sit well with Norton.      When Norton met with the director for Primal Fear (1996), he told them that he, like Aaron, came from eastern Kentucky. Norton even spoke with the twang (which he prepared by watching Coal Miner\'s Daughter (1980)).      His character Aaron Stampler in Primal Fear (1996), which was based on a book, did not have a stutter, but when he auditioned he gave him one.      (June 29, 2000) Was one of the few celebrities invited to Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston\'s Malibu wedding.      During filming Fight Club (1999), he and co-star Brad Pitt took soap-making classes.      He and Rounders (1998) co-star Matt Damon competed in the World Series of Poker at Las Vegas on May 1998 with the movie studio Miramax paying the $10,000 per person entrance fee.      His character, Worm, in Rounders (1998) was originally supposed to smoke but being avid non-smoker, he refused and the part rewritten as a non-smoker.      He worked as a waiter, a proofreader, and a director\'s assistant to try to get his foot in the door in New York City. He applied to be a New York City cab driver, but he was rejected for the license because he didn\'t meet the age requirement.      Speaks some Japanese, which helped when he worked, briefly, for his grandfather\'s company, The Enterprise Foundation. He was assigned to the Osaka, Japan branch until he quit the desk job grind at his grandfather\'s suggestion and decided to try to break into acting in New York.      Wilde Lake High School in Columbia, Maryland, where Edward graduated in 1987, built a new auditorium for the performing arts several years ago. He revisited his alma mater and gave a lecture on the day of the dedication. It is named after Edward\'s grandfather, James Rouse.      Received a B.A. in history from Yale in 1991, but took many theater and Japanese courses as an undergraduate. He has said in interviews that he took as many theater courses as he could without majoring in theater.      The theme song for Keeping the Faith (2000) - ""Heart of Mine"" by Peter Salett - was not written specifically for the film. Salett is a good friend of Edward\'s.      According to Yale\'s newspaper, he has wanted to play the poet Dylan Thomas for a long time, but feels he\'s not physically right for the part.      While a precocious 8-year-old actor, he asked a surprised director of a play, ""What is my objective here?"" The director was startled by his interest in acting.      His babysitter, Betsy True, went on to perform as Cossette in a Broadway version of Les Miserables. She was the one who originally piqued Edward\'s interest in acting, taking him to see his first play, If I Were A Princess, at age six.      Auditioned for the role of \'Rudy Baylor\' in the movie The Rainmaker (1997). The role eventually went to Matt Damon.      Got the role for Fight Club (1999) because director David Fincher enjoyed his performance in The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), which was the only film of the actor that he had seen.      Dedicated his directoral debut, Keeping the Faith (2000), to his late mother, Robin.      Older brother of Molly Norton and James Norton.      Turned down the role of Private Ryan in Saving Private Ryan (1998).      Oldest of three children.      Was considered for the role of Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon (1999). Director Milos Forman could not decide between him and Jim Carrey and left the decision up to the studio. The studio decided to go with Carrey.      His grandfather, James Rouse, is credited with being the inventor of the modern shopping mall.      Lost several pounds for Fight Club (1999).

It\'s a longstanding compulsion I\'ve had since I was about five or six years old. I can literally identify the moment it struck me. I went to see a play [If I Were a Princess] in which a babysitter of mine [Betsy True, who later acted on Broadway] was performing. I was completely shell-shocked by the magic of this little community-theater play; it just riveted me.      I don\'t smoke and I don\'t want to smoke. I am not a fan of gratuitous smoking in films.      Life, like poker has an element of risk. It shouldn\'t be avoided. It should be faced.      If I ever have to stop taking the subway, I\'m gonna have a heart attack.      Fame is very corrosive and you have to guard very strictly against it.      I\'ve never felt any particular encroachment of the \'celebrity\' stuff into my life.      I\'m an actor and, each time out, I\'m trying to convince the audience that I\'m this character. Every little thing that people know about you as a person impedes your ability to achieve that kind of terrific suspension of disbelief that happens when an audience goes with an actor and character [he\'s] playing.      The more you can create that magic bubble, that suspension of disbelief, for a while, the better.      It\'s a nice position to be in; I\'m lucky. At the same time, all the excitement of that has been put into stark perspective ... In some ways, the highs of it have been blunted, which in a way, is a gift.      First of all, you never make all things for all people and can\'t always pander to the broadest denominator. I keep an eye toward doing the themes that interest me. Do they move me? Interest me? Make me think? When I run across something that is provocative in an unsettling way, it appeals to me.      People wrestle sometimes making movies, and I think that conflict is a very essential thing. I think a lot of very happy productions have produced a lot of very banal movies.      I\'m not interested in making movies for everybody. I like making movies for myself and my friends and people with my sensibility.      I always felt that acting was an escape, like having the secret key to every door and permission to go into any realm and soak it up. I enjoy that free pass.      Nobody makes me uncomfortable here. It\'s a place where you can be eternally anonymous. - the reason he loves living in New York City.      In fact, the United States today keeps on making the same sort of mistakes. We force those methods we think are useful on a few countries, hoping to make a few changes.      I get heartbroken flying into L.A. It\'s just this feeling of unspecific loss. Can you imagine what the San Fernando Valley was when it was all wheat fields? Can you imagine what John Steinbeck saw?      Just because you\'ve made a couple movies, you\'ve done some good movies, you\'ve been nominated for some Academy Awards, whatever, nobody\'s entitled. It\'s a business. If they don\'t see it, I can think they\'re wrong, but I\'m not entitled to a $15 million budget to make a film.      He has such a rich mellifluous voice. Anytime I would hear him speak, it would remind me of how flat my voice is. (about Ralph Fiennes)      [on showing Marlon Brando The Simpsons (1989)] I showed him the episode where Marge gets cast in a musical version of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"". He loved it. Marlon loves stuff like that.      [on Robert De Niro] I look at De Niro, and the thing I admire about him is just the length and diversity of his career. He has just done so much wonderful work and so many different kinds of work. That to me is worth something.      I remember when I heard they were making The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), I was like, \'God, if they cheese those out, I\'m going to be so disappointed. (But) those films were inspiring to me in terms of deciding to take The Incredible Hulk (2008).      [on his role as a policeman in Pride and Glory (2008)] I started to have a special interest in this project when I thought this could actually be something that\'s reflecting the moment we are going through - in terms of a nation and as a culture - regarding a sense of ethics.      All people are paradoxical. No one is easily reducible, so I like characters who have contradictory impulses or shades of ambiguity. It\'s fun, and it\'s fun because it\'s hard.      I haven\'t personally really engaged in a lot of this new kind of social networking stuff like Twitter or Facebook or MySpace. I mean, the notion of people following what I am doing every day is like torture for me. It\'s absolutely the last thing that I\'m looking for. It seems to me to be really just about social chatter.      When you\'re working on a creative thing, everyone has an idea, and they\'re pushing it. The first time you work with anybody, you have to get comfortable with the way another person pushes hard for what they want. Familiarity breeds contempt, people say. But I\'ve found, for creative things, familiarity breeds peace of mind, because you realize you know someone better. You trust each other. You know not to take things a certain way, or a wrong way. You get to where you don\'t have to waste quite so much time with diplomacy. Things are a little more efficient.      We\'ve had a seminal legal decision whereby the Supreme Court defined corporations as having the same rights as individuals. It\'s having a massive impact on our politics. It\'s unleashed unlimited corporate spending on our elections, which is terrifying. The facade is now fully peeled off. There\'s no pretense about having limitations over how wealthy individuals and corporations can exert an unhealthy influence on politics with their money. It used to be a game - now no one\'s pretending any more. Individuals can contribute $20million while previously the maximum was $5,000. It\'s a radical transformation. You wonder what will occur before people feel it\'s creating an imbalance which diminishes them.      I studied music, theater and fine arts. My mother taught English literature and courses on Shakespeare (William Shakespeare). She was a regular theatergoer and I used to go with her. When I was 16, I saw Ian McKellen do a one-man show called Acting Shakespeare. It had an impact on my sense that acting was something you could do as an adult that affected people, that it wasn\'t just for entertainment, that you could change someone\'s mind with it. I started performing in the theater a lot more after that.      There\'s been a shift from people buying DVDs to streaming them online. The studios have been asleep at the switch and suffered a huge loss of revenue from falling DVD sales. Unfortunately, that revenue was often what helped convince them to make films which aren\'t blockbusters. Studios aren\'t as willing to make mid-budget, more thoughtful films aimed at adults. It\'s more challenging to get those films made than it was.      I spent a lot of my early career in the theatre - and by that I mean as an usher.      [About congress & global warming] I have very little doubt that the legacy of my generation is going to hinge on how we respond to these revelations that we\'re not living sustainably and that we are altering the environment.      [About George W. Bush] I almost forgot what it\'s like to be proud of my government.      If I ever have to stop taking the subway, I\'m going to have a heart attack.      [After not voting for George W. Bush in 2004] Do tax breaks for movie stars make any sense to you?      I grew up an honorary Jew. If you go to more than ten barmitzvahs you get an honorary Jew certificate. I went to at least ten in one year.

However, his portrayals of Billy Beane in Moneyball (2011), and Rusty Ryan in the remake of Ocean\'s Eleven (2001) and its sequels, also loom large in his filmography.Pitt was born William Bradley Pitt on December 18th, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and was raised in Springfield, Missouri. He is the son of Jane Etta (Hillhouse), a school counselor, and William Alvin Pitt, a truck company manager. He has a younger brother, Douglas (Doug) Pitt, and a younger sister, Julie Neal Pitt.

He left college two credits short of graduating to move to California. Before he became successful at acting, Pitt supported himself by driving strippers in limos, moving refrigerators and dressing as a giant chicken while working for ""el Pollo Loco"".Pitt\'s earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera Another World (1964) before appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary prime time soap opera Dallas (1978). Following a string of guest appearances on various television series through the 1980s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in Thelma & Louise (1991), in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned Geena Davis. This lead to starring roles in badly received films such as Johnny Suede (1991) and Cool World (1992).But Pitt\'s career hit an upswing with his casting in A River Runs Through It (1992), which cemented his status as an multi-layered actor as opposed to just a pretty face. Pitt\'s subsequent projects were as quirky and varied in tone as his performances, ranging from his unforgettably comic cameo as stoner roommate Floyd in True Romance (1993) to romantic roles in such visually lavish films as Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994) and Legends of the Fall (1994), to an emotionally tortured detective in the horror-thriller Se7en (1995). His portrayal of frenetic oddball Jeffrey Goines in Twelve Monkeys (1995) won him a Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role.Pitt\'s portrayal of Achilles in the big-budget period drama Troy (2004) helped establish his appeal as action star and was closely followed by a co-starring role in the stylish spy-versus-spy flick Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005). It was on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith that Pitt, who married Jennifer Aniston in a highly publicized ceremony in 2000, met his current partner Angelina Jolie. Pitt left Aniston for Jolie in 2005, a break-up that continues to fuel tabloid stories years after its occurrence.He continues to wildly vary his film choices, appearing in everything from high-concept popcorn flicks such as Megamind (2010) to adventurous critic-bait like Inglourious Basterds (2009) and The Tree of Life (2011). He has received two Best Actor Oscar nominations, for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) and Moneyball (2011).

Paid $29 million in a divorce settlement to Jennifer Aniston.Personal Quotes (38)      I\'m gonna design my own fleet of trailers. No! I\'m gonna record an album like Jennifer Lopez. It\'ll be an acoustic version of KC & The Sunshine Band. Then maybe I\'ll design a line of clothes like [Sean Combs] but all in synthetic fur.      I\'d like to design something like a city or a museum. I want to do something hands on rather than just play golf which is the sport of the religious right.      [Viasat magazine, May 2001] Fame is a bitch, man.      [on what keeps him humble] You know, I telephoned my grandparents the other day, and my grandfather said to me, ""We saw your movie."" ""Which one?"". I said, and he shouted, ""Betty, what was the name of that movie I didn\'t like?"". I thought that was just classic. I mean, if that doesn\'t keep your feet on the ground, what would?      I\'m one of those people you hate because of genetics. It\'s the truth.      Success is a beast. And it actually puts the emphasis on the wrong thing. You get away with more instead of looking within.      [Time magazine, October 13, 1997] You shouldn\'t speak until you know what you\'re talking about. That\'s why I get uncomfortable with interviews. Reporters ask me what I feel China should do about Tibet. Who cares what I think China should do? I\'m a f---ing actor! They hand me a script. I act. I\'m here for entertainment. Basically, when you whittle everything away, I\'m a grown man who puts on makeup.      When you see a person, do you just concentrate on their looks? It\'s just a first impression. Then there\'s someone who doesn\'t catch your eye immediately, but you talk to them and they become the most beautiful thing in the world. The greatest actors aren\'t what you would call beautiful sex symbols. I\'ll tell you who my favorite actress is, Dianne Wiest, and you wouldn\'t call her a sex symbol. Dianne Wiest is, to me, the most beautiful woman on the screen.      [when asked by Conan O\'Brien how he got into character as stoner Floyd in True Romance (1993)] I\'m a method actor.      [May 2005, on his impending divorce to Jennifer Aniston] The thing I don\'t understand is looking at this as a failure. It\'s talked about like it failed, I guess because it wasn\'t flawless. Me, I embrace the messiness of life. I find it so beautiful, actually.      [2003] It\'s amazing what an impending midlife crisis will do for you, really. It got me motivated, having turned 40 in December.      [on having children] It really changes your perspective on the world. You know, I\'ve had my day. I made some films, and I\'ve really had a very fortunate life, and it\'s time for me to share that a little bit. Having children takes the focus off yourself, which I\'m really grateful for. I\'m so tired of thinking about myself. I\'m sick of myself. You feel you want to be there and not miss out on anything. It\'s a true joy and a very profound love. You can write a book, you can make a movie, you can paint a painting, but having kids is the most extraordinary thing I\'ve ever taken on.      [on how his children will influence his future roles] My thoughts these days are, ""Oh, my God, what did I do? What are they going to see from the past?"". It definitely colors what I\'ll approach in the future. I\'ll try to be a little bit more mature about my decisions.      [on how his earlier, lesser film roles ultimately improved him as an actor]: I believe I\'m quite capable and we, as people, can learn to do anything, and that\'s proof of it! And my education is on film, on record! Now I can take on anything that comes my way and find truth in it an do a pretty good job.      [on Quentin Tarantino] The set is heaven and he is God. Heretics are not allowed.      [2010 - on New Orleans] Truthfully, my favorite sound in the entire world is opening up the balcony doors in the French Quarter and hearing four different sounds playing at once from the apartments across the way or down the street. It\'s a balmy night, twilight, and I\'m drinking a beer, and this feeling just falls over me, of contentment. It gives me goosebumps to talk about it.      [on being dumped by ex-fianc\xe9e Jill Schoelen in 1989] She called me up in Los Angeles and was crying on the phone. She was lonely and there was a huge drama. At this point, I had $800 to my name and I spent $600 of it getting a ticket from Los Angeles to Hungary to see her. I got there, went straight to the set where she was filming and that night we went out to dinner. She told me that she had fallen in love with the director of the film. I was so shocked I said, ""I\'m outta here."" I spent my night in Budapest, sitting on a bench, smoking, with just a local bum to talk to who couldn\'t speak English. These are the days and nights you remember when you have success. I returned to America absolutely broke. This is why recognition does not bother me too much.      Fame makes you feel permanently like a girl walking past construction workers.      [2009] What\'s valuable to me has become clearer as I\'ve got older. To me, it\'s about the value of your time and your day and the value of the people you spend it with. It\'s about me being a strong father and guide and a good match for my significant other. Then, if I\'m going to go to work, it must be something of value to me. I\'m much more experienced now, so I can find films that are interesting quicker and cut out the films that don\'t really matter. It means more to me now because my kids are going to see them, and I want them to be proud.      [1998, on why he moved to Los Angeles] A lot of the attraction before I came out was the fame, the lifestyle... now my motivation is more, ""I want to be good!"".      We make breakfast like everyone else and it\'s chaos and pancake batter splashed all over the place and bath time at night. Ultimately, I\'m dad. I have the concerns a dad has. Is everyone safe? Am I spending enough time with them? These are the things that keep me awake.      [on comparing his own parenting style with that of his character in The Tree of Life (2011)]: They say actions speak louder than words. It\'s even more true with my kids. And so it\'s quite important to me not to put my frustrations on them or bring them in the door. I want to keep them to be free and not encumbered with my junk. In the film it\'s the exact opposite. I find it very sad, a very sad man who was embittered by his situation, doesn\'t feel he can get ahead, always feels like he\'s on the losing end, feels quite oppressed by his surroundings and predicament, doesn\'t know why it isn\'t working out for him and why is it working out for other people. That poisoned view of things.      There are no secrets in our house. We tell the kids, ""Mom and Dad are going off to kiss."".      [2011] I spent the \'90s trying to hide out, trying to duck the full celebrity cacophony. I started to get sick of myself sitting on a couch, holding a joint, hiding out. It started feeling pathetic. It became very clear to me that I was intent on trying to find a movie about an interesting life, but I wasn\'t living an interesting life myself. I think that my marriage [to Jennifer Aniston] had something to do with it. Trying to pretend the marriage was something that it wasn\'t.      [2011, on Angelina Jolie] One of the greatest, smartest things I ever did was give my kids Angie as their mom. She is such a great mom. Oh, man, I\'m so happy to have her.      [2011, on learning to be a parent] I was surprised at how automatic it is, how much of it is instinctual. And now I have a great confidence and trust in those instincts. I mean, one sound at night and you\'re awake and up because they may need you. Or when they start to have a tantrum, you know to divert them from spinning out by helping them focus on something. It just goes on and on. I tell them, ""You can make a mess, but you\'ve got to clean it up."".      [2011, on his religious upbringing] I had my problems with it. It doesn\'t work for me. I had a lot of questions. But to get to that point where I actually questioned something that I\'d based my life on - it wasn\'t until I was 20 that I really started separating from it, knowing that the ideas didn\'t make sense. I remember this scary moment where I didn\'t have anything to pin my existence on, to be comforted by. At the same time, it didn\'t work for me, man. I had to go up against this thing. I\'ve since... My family accepts me for who I am and they worry for me because I\'m gonna burn in an eternal pit of fire. But...      [on the stress of filming Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994)] One day, it broke me... I called David Geffen, who was a producer... I said, ""David, I can\'t do this anymore. I can\'t do it. How much will it take to get me out?"". And he goes, very calmly, ""Forty million dollars."".      [on playing the leading character in The Tree of Life (2011)] That\'s certainly not my father. But I do understand the father-knows-best mentality, the oppression the father figure can have on his kids, the pressure he is under to be the leader and provide, and feeling like he\'s falling short and having wants and desires himself. The tragedy is coming home and bringing that on the kids, and then feeling bad about it. It\'s just this vicious cycle.      [on the Academy Awards nomination process] I\'ve been around long enough to know it\'s very fickle and it\'s a cyclical wheel. But I will say this: it\'s surprisingly fun when your number comes up.      [2012: while accepting the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for Moneyball (2011) and The Tree of Life (2011)] This is a really big honor for me, considering I\'m a guy who had never ridden in an airplane until I was 25. That first trip was here in 1989 to New York. I had an audition for a soap opera. But I had to put myself up, and I stayed at a friend\'s apartment. That apartment was in the Village on Christopher Street. My first impression of the city was: my god, there\'s a lot of guys around here. But they\'re so nice. This is a real pleasure for me to see some of the faces behind the formidable names that instill such fear and reverence in the film industry, although I thought you\'d be taller. We are complex, we are mysteries to ourselves, we are difficult to each other, we live in continual flux and instability and conflict. Christians and Muslims, Democrats and Republicans, Denby and Rudin.      I grew up very religious, and I don\'t have a great relationship with religion. I oscillate between agnosticism and atheism.      [2012: on whether he would consider becoming a director] No, not a chance. It makes sense on some level, but I really enjoy being a creative producer and I enjoy my day job as an actor. It\'s enough for me. I want to also be a dad, first and foremost. After two days it gets itchy. I miss them. I just know how I\'d be. I see how much time it takes to mount the thing and put it together. It wouldn\'t be a good match.      I think I\'m at a point now where I feel like I can jump into anything and lay something down that\'s quality. Someone may be better at it - or maybe not - but I know that if I have a feeling for it, then I can make it interesting. But even more as I get older, it\'s about the company that I keep. That\'s the most important thing to me - that if I\'m gonna spend however long it takes to make a movie, give up 14 hours a day for however many weeks or months, then it\'s very important for me to know that I\'m working with people who I respect and enjoy and that we\'re going for something together.      [on World War Z (2013)] We liked this idea of taking a genre and using that as, I guess, a metaphor for pandemics, and if one of those pandemics jumped the tracks. Would we be ready? What countries would be in better shape, what countries would take the biggest hit? A movie is only good if it speaks about our time, if it\'s personal in some way, and it plugs into the zeitgeist to irritate a little bit. I think we got that here.      [2012, on The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)] Jesse James is absolutely one of my favourites, and I think the more it decants the better it gets. About three other people think that as well, but I think it\'s got legs. It\'s elegant. Andrew Dominik is a phenomenal director.      [on The Devil\'s Own (1997)] We had no script. Well, we had a great script but it got tossed for various reasons. To have to make something up as you go along - Jesus, what pressure! It was ridiculous. It was the most irresponsible bit of filmmaking - if you can even call it that - that I\'ve ever seen. The movie was the complete victim of this drowning studio head (Mark Canton) who said, ""I don\'t care. We\'re making it. I don\'t care what you have. Shoot something.""      Terrence\'s Voyage of Time is an incredibly beautiful and unique experiential IMAX film for children and families chronicling the birth of time, I\'m very grateful to be part of such a fascinating and educational project, but I\'m currently focused on my family situation and don\'t want to distract attention away from this extraordinary film, which I encourage everyone to see.Salary (18)Less Than Zero\xa0(1987)      $38       Cutting Class\xa0(1989)      $12,000       Thelma & Louise\xa0(1991)      $6,000       Kalifornia\xa0(1993)      $500,000       Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles\xa0(1994)      $3,000,000       Se7en\xa0(1995)      $4,000,000       Sleepers\xa0(1996)      $10,000,000       The Devil\'s Own\xa0(1997)      $8,000,000       Seven Years in Tibet\xa0(1997)      $10,000,000       Meet Joe Black\xa0(1998)      $17,500,000       Fight Club\xa0(1999)      $17,500,000       The Mexican\xa0(2001)      $10,000,000       Spy Game\xa0(2001)      $17,500,000       Ocean\'s Eleven\xa0(2001)      $30,000,000 ($10m salary + backend participations)      Troy\xa0(2004)      $17,500,000       Mr. & Mrs. Smith\xa0(2005)      $20,000,000       The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\xa0(2007)      $1,000,000       Inglourious Basterds\xa0(2009)      $10,000,000           if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_finished\');    }      if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""be"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (typeof uex == \'function\') {      uex(""ld"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }""']","[u'\nMeat Loaf ', u'""    if (typeof uet == \'function\') {      uet(""bb"", ""NameBioWidget"", {wb: 1});    }    if (\'csm\' in window) {      csm.measure(\'csm_NameBioWidget_started\');    }  Showing all 77 itemsJump to:Overview\xa0(3)\xa0|Mini Bio\xa0(1)\xa0|Spouse\xa0(2)\xa0|Trade Mark\xa0(1)\xa0|Trivia\xa0(49)\xa0|Personal Quotes\xa0(21)  Overview (3)Date of Birth27\xa0September1947,\xa0Dallas, Texas, USA Birth NameMarvin Lee AdayHeight6\'\xa0(1.83\xa0m)    Mini Bio (1)          Meat Loaf was born in Texas, and moved to Los Angeles in 1967 to play in local bands and appear in musicals such as ""Hair"" and ""As You Like It"". He made his film debut with a memorable role in cult film The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975). In 1977, he and lyricist Jim Steinman released an operatic rock album called ""Bat Out Of Hell"", the record was huge and has sold 35,000,000 copies worldwide. However, the tour promoting the album took a toll on Meat\'s voice and left him unable to sing on the follow-up record ""Bad For Good"". Meat Loaf stayed in the dark through the eighties doing 4 records which never got any airplay or chart position in the US. Meat Loaf appeared in films Out of Bounds (1986) as a Pilot, and The Squeeze (1987) with Michael Keaton. But after getting back together with Steinman, they delivered a powerful sequel ""Bat Out Of Hell II"" which went to #1 in the US and UK. Bat II has now sold an excess of 20,000,000 copies. His TV credits include the Soldier being held prisoner in Vietnam in Lightning Force (1991), a mad Doctor who invents a serum to keep zombies from deteriorating in Monsters (1988) and a slick Landlord of a restaurant who ends up on the menu in HBO series Tales from the Crypt (1989).

It spent over 470 weeks in the UK charts - an all-time record.      According to ""The Guiness Book Of World Records 2000"" Meat Loaf\'s ""Bat Out Of Hell"" is the biggest selling album in the UK ever.      His movies Blacktop (2000) & Trapped (2001) and his special appearances in TV series Lightning Force (1991), The Outer Limits (1995), John Doe (2002) & Masters of Horror (2005) were all filmed in Vancouver, B.C., Canada.

This made him $1,000,000 richer      Had a massive standing ovation at the CBS convention in New Orleans in 1977-78      He was offered lead vocalist position in the rock band Foreigner, but wanted to stay with Jim Steinman.

Was starring Off-Off Broadway in Paul Foster and John Braden\'s ""Silver Queen"" at La Mama E.T.C. when he was offered the role of ""Eddie"" in the American stage premiere of ""The Rocky Horror Show"". He had to leave ""Silver Queen"" a week before closing. His role was taken over by ""Silver Queen\'s"" director Robert Patrick, who had to wrap Meat Loaf\'s costume\'s trousers around him twice.      Daughter Pearl Aday is a back-up singer with his band.      Won a Grammy for the song ""I\'d Do Anything For Love (But I Won\'t Do That)""      Father, with Leslie Aday, of two daughters: Pearl Aday and Amanda Aday.      17 November 2003 - Collapsed whilst performing on stage in London. Doctors said it was Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is a syndrome of pre-excitation of the ventricles of the heart due to an accessory pathway known as the Bundle of Kent. This accessory pathway is an abnormal electrical communication from the atria to the ventricles.      Was the producers\' second choice to play ""Bluto"" in Animal House (1978) if John Belushi was unavailable.      Went to Thomas Jefferson High School in Dallas, Texas.      Performed at the Australian NRL grand final on 5 October, 2003.      Admits to being a fantasy sports junkie.      Was a vegetarian for 15 years but then decided to eat meat. His favorite meat is pork chops.      In addition to songs from his own albums, his concerts usually include the song ""Hot Patootie"", which he sang as Eddie in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975).      When he first started rehearsals for the stage version of The Rocky Horror Show neither he nor the rest of the cast were aware of the sexual content of the play. It was only relatively late into the rehearsal stage that they found out, when Tim Curry (whom they had never met, he had been brought over from the London production) turned up on stage in full Frank-N-Furter costume and make-up singing ""Sweet Transvestite."" It was then that they realized what the show was really about. Meat Loaf walked out of the rehearsals and refused to do the show, but was talked into doing one performance to see how it went. When he saw how much the audience loved the show he agreed to stay on for the entire run.      Lived in Freeland, Michigan for a few years with a family.      Received a fan letter from a Swedish fan named Jerker, which has been widely regarded as the greatest joke ever in the Swedish fan base with the phrase: ""Don\'t let your meat loaf, jerker!"".      Despite being known as a singer, Meat Loaf has only sung in two films - The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) and Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny (2006). The reason for this is because he wanted to be taken seriously as an actor and not get typecast into singing roles.      When President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, he was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Meat and some friends were at the hospital when the limo arrived and witnessed Jackie being taken in to the hospital.      Mentioned on the Celebrity Apprentice that he has suffered 18 concussions and a fractured skull over his lifetime.

Rock and roll is about getting free beer and getting laid.      I\'m an actor. I started as an actor. I started on Broadway doing \'Hair\' and Shakespeare in the Park.      \'Hell in a Handbasket\' is not dealing with the political nature of the country. It\'s dealing with the humanity and the compassion of the world.      As most people know, I am a vampire, so I have no reflection. Every day, I paste a picture of someone else on the mirror.      I never fit in. I am a true alternative. And I love being the outcast. That\'s my role in life, to be an outcast.      Rock n\' Roll came from the slaves singing gospel in the fields. Their lives were hell and they used music to lift out of it, to take them away. That\'s what rock n\' roll should do - take you to a better place.      There\'s no explanation for success. Success just comes out of life.      The day that I ever become hip... please shoot me and put me outta my misery!      My life\'s far too complicated to be summed up in one song. It would take 20 just to represent one single day.      My gigs are built on improvisation: I go out there and I\'m like the Energizer bunny.      Just ask anybody who is getting old - everything starts hurting. For me, it\'s my shoulders, thumbs, knees and feet.      I\'m asthmatic. I was a lot bigger back then, and I still get winded on stage today. But I\'ve learned how to pace it now. I have musical breaks in there.      For the past 32 years, I\'ve done nothing outside the entertainment business. I\'ve had some real highs and some real lows, but I love the work so much that I never once thought of quitting.      A lot of actors, they know the camera\'s there, and if somebody moves around or makes noise or whatever then they get all distracted, but I pretty much lock in. You can\'t distract me too much.      When your name is on the marquee, you either get the glory or you get the hits.      When I do film, I really take on roles and I take on characters.      You know, people think I named myself Meat Loaf, even though I didn\'t. And they think anyone who would name himself Meat Loaf couldn\'t have an IQ higher than four.      There was a band in Australia named Midnight Oil, and they were a very, very political, and they literally hit you over the head with a hammer. U2 sometimes can hit you over the head with a rubber hammer.      It\'s like people call me a rock star or this or that. And I go, \'Don\'t call me that. I don\'t think of myself in those terms. If you have to call me anything, call me a chameleon.      In the early 1980s, I got into a war with my management - they just kept on suing me and I lost everything.

Taking\nthe ""Choose life,"" anti-consumerism rant at the beginning\nof ""Trainspotting,"" and carrying it to its logical -- albeit\nextreme -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film\nthat takes a lot of risks by biting the hand that feeds\nit.\nThe film's narrator (Edward Norton) is an insignificant cog\nin the drab, corporate machine, dutifully doing his job and\nwhat he's told without question. He's an insomniac slave to\nhis IKEA possessions and only finds joy in going to as\nmany self-help/dealing with terminal diseases sessions\nas he can. It provides him with an escape from his\nsleepless nights. That is, until Marla Singer (Helena\nBonham Carter), a trashy chain-smoking poser, enters his\nlife and upsets his routine. The narrator also meets Tyler\nDurden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic soap salesman whose\nstraightforward honesty, candor and sleazy lounge-lizard\noutfits are a breath of fresh air.\nOne night, after the two men have bonded over beers, Tyler\nasks the narrator to hit him. At first, it seems like an absurd\nrequest but after they pound on each other for a bit, a\nstrange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind of\nrelease and satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. In\na world where people are desensitized to everything\naround them, the physical contact of fighting wakes them\nup and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in and\npretty soon Fight Club becomes an underground\nsensation. However, it becomes readily apparent that Tyler\nhas more elaborate plans than just organizing brawls at\nthe local bar.\nDavid Fincher has taken the dark, pessimistic worldview of\n""Seven"" and married it with the clever plot twists and turns\nof ""The Game"" and assembled his strongest effort to date.\n""Fight Club"" is a $50+ million studio film that remains true\nto its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message\n-- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame.\nWhat makes ""Fight Club"" a subversive delight is not only its\nrefreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said\nmessage. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don't\nreally watch the film but rather download it. Its structure is\nextremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an\nincredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all\nover the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even\nmaking a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a\nfunny, interesting way that completely works. Yet Norton's\ndeadpanned narration holds everything together and\nallows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening.\nThis is the way films should be made. Why must we\nalways have to go through the A+B+C formula? ""Fight Club""\nopenly rejects this tired, clearly outdated structure in favour\nof a stylized frenzy of jump cuts, freeze frames, slow motion\nand every other film technique in the book that only\nreinforces its anarchistic message.\nA film like this would have never been greenlighted by a\nmajor studio if Brad Pitt had not been attached to the\nproject. Once you see the film, it becomes obvious that he\nwas the only choice for Tyler Durden. Like he did with\n""Kalifornia"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"", Pitt grunges himself\ndown and disappears completely into his role to a\nfrighteningly convincing degree. During many of the brutal\nfight scenes, he is transformed into a bloody, pulpy mess\nthat'll surely have the ""Legends of the Fall"" fans running for\nthe exits. It is an incredible performance -- probably his\nbest -- for the simple fact that he becomes the character so\ncompletely.\nIf Pitt has the flashy, gonzo role, Edward Norton is his\nperfect foil as the seemingly meek yet sardonic narrator. It's\na deceptively understated performance as the last third of\nthe film reveals but Norton nails it perfectly. He is clearly\nour surrogate, our introduction into this strange world and\nhis wry observations on our consumer-obsessed culture\nare right on the money. They are the perfect setup for\nTyler's introduction and his view on the world which is\nclearly a call to arms of sorts, a manifesto that rejects the\nnotion that we are what we own.\nAnd ultimately, that is what ""Fight Club"" tries to do. The film\nis a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges the\nstatus quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in\na materialistic world where those who have the most stuff,\n""win."" I think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that\ndown, reject corporate monsters like Starbucks and\nBlockbuster, and try to figure out what we really want out of\nlife. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation through\nself-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas\nthat makes ""Fight Club"" a dangerously brilliant film that\nentertains as well as enlightens.\n</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nThe script was tight, the theme fascinating, the acting incredible\n(especially Edward Norton, as one might expect), the direction inspired,\nand\nthe cinematography stunning.

Directed\nby the same man who brought us the superb 'The Game' this is another film\nwhich you'll have to see more than once to truly understand.  Focusing on\nsad white-collar, middle-class Norton whose only real dream in life is to\nown all the contents of an IKEA catalogue it follows him through a chance\nmeeting with charismatic stranger Pitt and the unfortunate events which\nconspire to draw them together. After a nights hard drinking they start a\nfriendly-ish scrap which is viewed by a couple of others and from that\nsmall\nacorn a mighty oak called Fight Club grows. This is the point around which\nthe whole film revolves with Norton and Pitt forming an underground club\nwhich draws more and more disillusioned young men to join it. Based on firm\n'Queensbury Rules' it is a cathartic if bloody way to spend your night.\nEventually as it becomes a huge operation Pitt, the de facto leader, moves\nit up a gear and creates his own cult from this secret society. This is\nwhere the film becomes brilliant and the twist near the end is magnificent,\nbetter even than the much talked about 'The Sixth Sense'. It just has so\nmuch to say about things: the emasculation of an entire generation of young\nmen (""No great war to fight, no great depression""), the growing isolation\nwe\nall feel from one another and the need to find something to draw us back\ntogether and most importantly, the power of an exciting, challenging idea\nand it's fermentation into cultism. However, where many films would just\nsay\n'This is a bad thing' 'Fight Club' doesn't. It is more a condemnation of a\nmaterialistic society which has forgotten about a large section of itself.\nYou can empathise with these men completely, even when they band together\nagainst this uncaring society that has reared them to be something their\ninstincts don't understand.

In a different vein from\nAmerican\nBeauty, Fight Club explores the solutions to the veritable sleepwalking\nexistence that plagues modern life.  The film is violent, but it is not\ngratuitous violence, and any reviewer who claims that the film is promoting\nviolence has missed the entire point of the film. A very black comedy, it\nis\nsure to provoke much conversation- it is definitely a film to see with\nfriends.  The film is fast-paced, densely packed and merits a second\nviewing, just to take it all in, especially if you haven't read the book.\nIn typical Fincher style, you the viewer are left to draw your own\nconclusions. He feels no impetus to tell you how to interpret what you've\nseen, appropriate since the film condemns falling victim to the strictures\nof what society tells us to think and to value.

Director David Fincher\n(Aliens, Se7en and The Game) is at his finest here warping both space and\ntime, dropping in things here and there to make things clear. Edward\nNorton\nis excellent as Jack, the narrator of the movie. He is a nerdy insomniac\nwho\ncatalog shops at Ikea and has a going nowhere job. Brad Pitt is dynamic as\nTyler Durden, an anarchistic man who lives in a run-down abandoned house\nand\nmakes and sells soap for a living. Helen Bonham Carter is also great as\nMarla Singer, the manic-depressive chain-smoking woman in both their\nlives.\nHer role is critical and she plays it well.<br><br>There has been some controversy about the violence in this film but it is\nnot gratuitous violence, it is part of the story and serves it well. It is\nmuch less than what you would see in your average Hollywood blockbuster.\nThis is actually an insightful film and in many ways similar to American\nBeauty, although this film is much more in your face about it's message.\nIf\nyou are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful\nbloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also\na\nhuge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The\nSixth\nSense. And I must admit, it is the twist in this film that made me really\nlove it. The best audience for this film is men in their 20's or 30's, but\nanyone that can appreciate film as a modern art should like it. One of the\nbest films of 1999.\n</br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><a href=""reviews-enter"">Add another review</a></p>>], [<bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nThis film, is basically, at least in my opinion, one of the greatest films\never, period.  I read the book afterwards, and equally enjoyed the book.\nThe film is definitely for younger people, the critics of films, in general\nare older, so they cannot appreciate this film.  The film defines the\nyounger generation, only younger people can relate to it, however, older\npeople(middle aged+) can appreciate the art of the film, the beauty of the\ncamera work, as well as the excellent acting.  The film, in every aspect is\nfantastic, it begins with a rather humorous narration, from a person we grow\nto know as, ""narrator"".  It goes about to show how he lives, and his way of\nlife.  In these scenes alone, movie lines that will go down in history are\nsaid, and it's only the first twenty minutes.  The film tends to progress\nfaster and faster as the film continues.  We delve into the narrators\npsyche, and find that he is not unlike most people in this world, he has a\ntendency to say to people what they want to hear, even if it is not the\ntruth in it's entirety.  Almost all folks can relate to the main character,\nand he feels to be a real human, not a character in a story.  This, is\npartially due to the excellent directing, as well as book, but it is mostly\ndue to the fantastic performance by Edward Norton. It, in my opinion is an\nOscar performance.  Bradd Pitt gives his best performance to date, he is\ndefinitely an excellent coworker with David Fincher, they seem to share a\ncommon thread when it comes to film making I suppose.  I have full intention\nof purchasing this film when it is released on VHS and DVD.  Do yourself a\nfavour, see this film, if that is not an option, at least read the book.  If\nyou are younger and feel unrest with society, this is the film.\n\n</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nDavid Fincher is terrific with his camera. Visually his films are a\nwonder. Unfortunately the contents are so thin that the interiors of\nhis tale vanish very quickly. What remains is ""the look"" and the\npromise, no matter how unfulfilled the promise remains. Edward Norton\nis sensational, especially in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Brad\nPitt, already a film icon, does his thing, and that, of course, is a\nplus. Helena Bonham Carter surprised me big time with a facade I had\nnever seen. The slow motion of the smoke coming out of her mouth as\nFincher introduces her to us is a work of art in itself but, and that\n""but"" is a real problem, nothing remains because deep down there is\nnothing there but a fantastic eye for and to startle and amaze. I'm\nsure that sooner or later David Fincher will come out with something\nthat is as powerful inside as it is outside.\n</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nI sat through the first half of this movie with my mouth open. It was\nso exciting, brilliant, a Fritz Lang for the new millennium. Edward\nNorton's face. That insomnia that he carries all over him is so\nmagnificently drawn that creates the opposite effect on its audience. I\nwas awake, very awake, sitting on the edge of my seat, devouring every\nmoment, enjoying it like hell. Helena Bonham Carter was a like a great\nsilent movie star doing her first talkie. Pola Negri, Theda Bara. As if\nthis wan't enough, Brad Pitt, and Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt with all its\nfabulous connotations. Then, can you explain to me why I detested this\nmovie? Why it made me so angry? Can you? I can only tell you that half\nway through I turned against the movie or the movie turned against me,\neither way I didn't like it. I felt cheated in the worse possible way.\nI felt treated like a moron. You start promising me the most unique\nfilm experience I've had in a long time but what you delivered was a\ntired, opportunistic, gimmicky, easy piece of nonsense. Why? David\nFincher is one of the most consummated craftsmen American movies have\never had. Don't you agree? He can tell you a story, even something like\n""Seven"", a horror thriller, in a way we've never seen before, at least\nhalf of it. He has an eye like no other. That's why my frustration. An\nartist like that putting himself at the service of something that's not\ndone, not finished not worthy of his talents. You may think I'm being a\nbit too hard on the man. But let me tell you, it's out of love. I\nexpect so much from him, I've seen what he is capable of. But so far\nhave been only halves. Brilliantly acted, sensational to look at, but\nhalves, just halves. He should look at Fritz Lang, Pietro Germi, Alfred\nHitchcock, Michael Powell, William Wellman and naturally John Ford,\nMartin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Fincher already inherited\nsomething from each one of them. Now the trick is that it isn't a\ntrick. Half is better than nothing.

Midway through I told myself that if I heard that ""I\nam Jake's this and that"" line again I would get up and leave, but sure\nenough I kept hearing it and I stayed.  Maybe I'm as dumb as the\nfilmmakers.\nThe fact of the matter is that I haven't seen a plot this full of holes\nsince ""Slugs"".  So if I start a fight club, the participants will just\nstart\nshowing up at my doorstep out of the blue and turn into mind-numbed drones\nthat do my evil bidding???  Not only that, but this movie also taught me\nthat if I stick a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger, not only will I\nlive\nbut I'll be able to talk to people in my normal voice, as long as I put a\ngauze pad on it.<br><br>If you still don't know, this movie is about a clinically-depressed guy\nwho's search for therapy leads him to Brad Pitt, who teaches him that\nbeating the bejeezus out of people will brighten his spirits.  More guys\nfind out about this, and they all join the ""fight club"" and then naturally\ngo live with Pitt to become his evil minions.  Of course! This must be how\nthe Wicked Witch found all those monkeys.  Their evil deeds get worse and\nworse, and the supposedly still-sane Norton inexplicably keeps hanging out\nwith this bunch.  This leads to one totally inane scene where the evil\nmonkeys return from a gunfight with one of their members dead, and all\nNorton can do is whine ""C'mon guys, cut it out"".<br><br>So after this movie backs itself into a miserable corner, it's only escape\nis the equally awful ""It was all a dream"" ending, where we find out that\nBrad Pitt was just Norton's evil imaginary friend, and that Norton had been\ncommitting all these acts himself.  Please audience, forget the fact that\nthe ""imaginary"" Pitt managed to pull Norton from a burning car wreck and\npick him up off the ground and hurl him down a flight of stairs.  I don't\ncare how psycho you are, your imaginary friend cannot physically pick you\nup.<br><br>Plot hole #9233 asks us to believe that during this short time, Norton had\nbeen in EVERY MAJOR CITY in the US forming more armies of mind-numbed robot\nmonkeys, and that every male over the age of 18 in the United States was\nnow\na member of his ""secret"" evil gang.  So anyhow, Norton finally realizes\nthat\nhe's been crazy all this time, and to kill Pitt he sticks a gun in his own\nmouth and blows his neck off, a wound which apparently isn't as\ndebilitating\nas you would think, since he manages to get right up and make up with his\ngirlfriend and watch peacefully as his evil plot comes to fruition.

Let me list\nthem:<br><br>1. The most irritating movie 2. The most ridiculous high-budget movie\n(beating Knowing) 3. The most overrated movie (beating Pulp Fiction -\nGotta admit, I didn't think this record was going to be beaten for a\nwhile longer)<br><br>To describe this film as a train wreck would be the understatement of\nthe century. There isn't a word or phrase in existence to sum up this\ncolossal nightmare. The closest I can come to it is the word\n'abomination'. But go ahead and knock yourself out with a thesaurus.\nIt's definitely the worst high-budget or worst high-rated movie I have\never seen, and I don't think that's a record that will be beaten for a\nlong, long time. <br><br>The person who wrote this had absolutely no idea how to create a\nbelievable or coherent story (or else was trolling). It literally\ncannot work in the real world in ANY WAY. Even if this were a comic\nbook fiction, the plot would have more holes in it than Britney Spears'\nbrain. But it's set in our world and with ordinary humans. Well, I say\n'ordinary', but the humans in this film have seemingly had brain tissue\nremoved so they can get from A to B without wondering what the hell is\ngoing on.<br><br>I could go through the movie and write a thesis on everything that is\ncontrary to good storytelling, but I will instead highlight some things\nthat spring to mind:<br><br>1. A man goes into his place of work and threatens to kill his boss and\nco-workers. His boss does nothing at all about it. Not to mention the\nman is coming into work all the time with a smashed-in face.<br><br>2. If the ""Fight Club"" were real, the people in it would be dead long\nbefore they could enact a master plan. No human could or would inflict\nthis level of damage on such a frequent basis. <br><br>3. You cannot beat yourself up the way the main character in this film\ndoes. It's physically impossible - and probably mentally impossible,\ntoo. When Jim Carrey did this in Liar Liar, we all laughed because it's\nfunny and worked in a comedy. How thick does a director have to be to\nthink this can work in a serious setting? The laws of biology are also\nabsent for the duration of this picture, because a silly thing like\nfact can interfere with a bad writer's screenplay. Some dumb\nindividuals tried to create their own Fight Club after seeing this\nmovie, but they quickly learned the difference between reality and bad\nfiction. Brain damage, pain, and serious injury exist in the real\nworld, folks. Who'd have thunk it?<br><br>4. There is no way that one person (especially a nut job) could\ninfiltrate so many organizations in such a coordinated fashion, or\nplant so many bombs without people finding out. The real world is a bit\nmore complicated than the moron who wrote this obscenity. A Tom and\nJerry cartoon has better logic than this film. <br><br>5. Man's apartment (part of a tower block) is blown to bits and the\npolice find out dynamite was involved. Man is told not to go anywhere\nbut is then allowed to jet about the country. He isn't even brought in\nfor questioning. Are you realizing why this story is cuckoo, yet?<br><br>6. There is no possible way a psychopath could brainwash so many people\nand form a large-scale army, spread over such a wide area. But the plot\nneeds it to happen - so it does. Oh, I love it when writers do that.\nDon't you?<br><br>7. The twist makes as much sense as the rest of the film. It's not just\nimpossible, it's ludicrous. It's so bad that even a three year old\nwould laugh at it.<br><br>Fight Club also joins Pulp Fiction and Goodfellas as films to be in the\ntop 20 simply because of gratuitous violence and gore. At least\nGoodfellas is a decent film with some basis in reality.<br><br>The only reason this film has been rated so high is because the dumb\nmasses will swallow anything with violence and a pseudo-intellectual\nscript. People who gave this film 10/10 are either gormless fools or\nmindless barbarians. It's an absolute travesty for the human race that\nFight Club is currently in the top 10, let alone top 250.<br><br>It's beyond all my powers of reasoning to comprehend how people can\nlike something as lazily written and ridiculous as this festering\ndisease of a film. It has absolutely zero credibility.<br><br>My rating 0/5: DO NOT WATCH. STEER WELL CLEAR.

My\nrebuttal: Couldn't they sit down and have a conversation? Write a\ndiary? Go on Springer? 'Fight Club' stars Edward Norton, one of my\nfavorite actors who always brings a refreshing intelligence to his\nwork. He plays a depressed urbanite who works too hard doing a job he\nhates and makes expensive orders from the catalogue maybe as a measure\nof his worth.<br><br>To us, Norton's character is known only as 'The Narrator'. He has no\nmeaning in his life so he develops and interesting habit: he is\naddicted to various support groups for Alcoholics, sex addicts and one\nfor men with testicular cancer, among others. He spots a woman named\nMarla (Helena Bonham Carter) who is attending some of the same\nmeetings. He knows that she is an addict like himself but to keep the\nillusion real so they have to work out an alternating schedule.<br><br>On an airplane he meets Tyler Durden who has The Narrator's number\nright from the start. Later he turns to Tyler for help when his\napartment catches fire. So, Tyler takes him into his rather grungy\nworld.

The\nfight scenes in 'Fight Club' are brutal, bloody but never seem to cause\npermanent injury.<br><br>In trying to defend itself 'Fight Club' jumbles it's own twisted\nmessage. The idea of this club is apparently to free yourself from the\nrules that tie us down. I guess getting socked in the head is suppose\nto give you a thicker skin (but apparently not a concussion). Then the\nmovie turns all the members of the club into a cult. What? Free your\nmind and then do as you are told? This is about where the movie goes to\npieces. 'Fight Club' makes a twist that pulls the rug out from under\nwhat little logical reasoning the film had. The screenplay develops the\ninsane logic of the reality of unreality .. . or something like that.\nOut of respect for those planning to see the movie I will say no more.<br><br>David Fincher is a director that I have a lot of hope for. This is his\nfourth film and the impressive, intelligent 'Se7en' showed the full\npower of his potential. I love the style of his films. He uses dark\nsets and grimy setting to set the story in motion. I was not impressed\nby 'Alien3' save for the amazing production design and 'The Game' was\nbadly in need of a sense of humor. 'Fight Club' isn't his worst film\nbecause of its impressive first act. Imagine what kind of great social\ncommentary could have come from a movie about two people addicted to\n12-step programs. That is original.

It\nis based on the novel written by Chuck Palahniuk. Edward Norton &amp; Brad\nPitt have acted in this film.<br><br>I love this film because of its philosophy. Probably this is one film\nwhich is very close to my heart. I am addicted to this film, in a way\nit motivates me; therefore whenever I feel low I choose to watch this\nfilm.<br><br>I also love this film for its motivational quotes, its unconventional\ncharacters, stylized treatment, and dripping background scores\x85<br><br>However, I don't think that any conscious reason will justify my\nexplanation behind taking this film as a topic for film analysis; hence\nI will only say that this is my kind of cinema. Story:- Fight Club is a\nfascinating story of an Edward Norton and his world, his inner as well\nas outer world. This is a story of Tyler Durden. Edward Norton is a\nsocial animal who lives a monotonous life. He buys everything of which\nhe sees an advertisement, however at the end of the day he also knows\nthat nothing is worth buying. He is bored of his routine and flat life.\nHe is bored of his falsehood, the artificiality in him have created all\nthe complication in the story. On one not so fine day his fully\nfurnished and occupied complex caught fire, he felt so lost and\ndepressed. He just wanted to share his grief to anybody, hence he\ncalled Tyler Durden to whom he has recently met in an airplane and with\nwhom he has also exchanged a number. This was his greatest mistake.\nTyler was smart, dynamic and everything that Edward Norton has always\naspires to be. Tyler was free from all kind of obligation and\nresponsibilities. Edward Norton collaborated with Tyler and starts a\nclub known as Fight Club. Fight Club is the way to break free. It is a\nclub where two people will fight with each other. It is a club with the\ncertain set of rules. Members of fight club are obliged to these rules.\nTyler was the mentor, motivator and inspiration for the club member,\nthey respect Tyler. This brought Tyler an opportunity to initiate\nproject ""Mayhem"" (I am not going to disclose the details of Project\nMayhem as it will be spoiler). However I will like to tell that Project\nMayhem was all about destruction, it was all about economic\nequilibrium. Edward Norton didn't want this to happen as it will create\nhavoc, and thus he fought against Project Mayhem, he fought against\nTyler. But how can you defeat the animal within? Fight Club is a social\nfilm which deals with metaphysical plot.<br><br>""Tyler Durden"" is one of my favorite characters in the history of\ncinema, and Brad Pitt has excellently portrayed the character of Tyler\nDurden. I don't think that any other Actor other than Brad Pitt would\nhave done justice to this character. Brad Pitt has given style to the\ncharacter which was needed. I think Brad Pitt was most appropriate for\nthe role of Tyler Durden however I will also say that the character of\nTyler Durden was such a well written character half the job of the\nactor was done while writing it.<br><br>Edward Norton is a fantastic actor, he have a capability to get into\nthe skin of the character. In this film he has played a narrator and\nstory was said from his point of view. I will say that Edward Norton\nhave done a great job, as his character was recognized even after the\npresence of the strong character of Tyler Durden.<br><br>David Fincher is a great storyteller he had courage to tell this\ncomplicated story with such a style and elegance. I have watched this\nfilm hundreds of time, and after watching and re-watching this film\nagain and again I can say that this may be one of flawless film that I\nhave watched. I respect the director for his detailing on the script,\non his characters. I respect him for the style that he put in the film.\nI respect him for the subject of the film. Dialogues is also one of the\nmost important part of this film, every time Tyler Durden speaks his\nwords punches the viewer on their face. This film is full of quote and\nI will like to mention some of it over here.<br><br>""Things that you own ends up owning you""<br><br>""You are not the content of the wallet, You are not your job, You are\nnot the car that you own, You are all the singing and dancing crab of\nthis world""<br><br>And many more\x85<br><br>Hypnotic background score and cinematography have done its job. On a\nwhole I love this film as it motivates me every time I watch this.<br><br>Strongly Recommended...\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nFirst, for this great masterpiece, I would like to thank David Fincher.\nThe film gives a great message on psychology. But the main purpose is\nto show what level shambles of today's youth. The film tackles the\ndecline of today's youth in a very hard way. Officially something new\ncomes out after today's young people run the thing themselves or\ndedicate themselves to always search for a leader, this problem offers\nin a great way the audience. Acting I can say enormous. Formally\nintegrated the roles of the players. Already today, many people have\ncome by Tyler Durden character of history is considered as the best\nanti-hero. Every part of the film is filled with great criticism about\nour day. Also great to send on to mention other films. One of the most\nimportant elements of the film I'd say the mystery. Indeed, for someone\nwith no knowledge of the subject monitors and film for the first time\nin a very difficult prediction about the end of the film. Absolutely\nshould for everyone to see, and even to do bedside film is a\nmasterpiece..\n</p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><b>*** This review may contain spoilers ***</b></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\n\nTo the world: This isn't really a movie about dumb guys beating each other\nup because they're too bored to do anything else. No, Fight Club is\nactually\nabout personal and cultural revolution within a corporate consumer society\nthat destroys the human spirit.\nAt least, that's how I saw it.<br><br>I loved this movie, and rating it a ten is not some whimsical fancy--I\ndon't\nhand out gold stars for nothing. It looks good, sounds good, pacing,\ndialogue, acting, etc. are all excellent. Why it didn't rate higher on the\nmainstream critics' lists for cinematography alone is beyond\nme.<br><br>What really makes this movie shine, though, is the unflinching way in which\nit looks at North American society--our mass consumerism, our slavery to\nstuffy corporate office jobs, our growing lack of what makes us human. The\nmovie doesn't pull many punches.<br><br>Norton's character is the automaton office lackey who is desperately\nsearching for meaning in his materialistic shell of a life, Pitt plays the\nmodern-day surfer/hippie Tyler Durden whose devil-may-care, spontaneous\nattitude to life offers the perfect (?) solution. These two personalities\nstruggle to reconcile their different perspectives on life without\ndestroying their relationship. To make things more difficult, Bonham Carter\ncreates a love triangle to further test the friendship.<br><br>Is it better to be free, alive, and chaotic, as in Pitt's anarchistic\nvision, or safe, secure, and bored like Norton's capitalist American Dream\nlife? Or, can a compromise be found? Can love conquer all? This is the\nperipheral, deeper stuff Fight Club is made of, not the smack-down action\nthat the trailers and critics focused on.<br><br>This movie demands at least one viewing. If you're queasy about violence\n(there is a graphic fight scene or two), then watch it with someone who's\nalready seen it and ask for an edited version. Even if you don't end up\nrespecting the movie's message or the complicated questions it asks, it\nremains a well-crafted film, deserving of recognition.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p>\nFight Club is directed by David Fincher and stars Edward Norton, Brad\nPitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, and Jared Leto. Edward Norton's\ncharacter, known only as the Narrator, is living a depressing life. His\nday job is behind a desk, and he accompanies himself by buying things\nthat he doesn't really need in order to find fulfillment in his life.\nHe begins attending support groups for conditions that he doesn't have,\nin order to feel relief through expressing his pain to those who have\nit worse.<br><br>Once Bonham Carter's character, Marla Singer, begins showing up to\nthese meetings, he begins to feel remorse in his life again. However,\nonce he meets cool guy Tyler Durden (Pitt), he, along with Tyler, start\na ""fight club,"" a place in which men who seek fulfillment may find it\nthrough beating each other up. Once things with both Tyler and Marla\nbegin to get a bit shaky, our Narrator must fix his own problems\nwithout the help of others.<br><br>It's very rare to find a film in which you completely love everything\nabout. In my humble opinion, however, Fight Club is easily one of the\nbest films ever made. With its eerie direction, fantastic acting, and\nmore than compelling characters, Fight Club is as close as it gets to\nperfect, with no issues to be found in it. The flawless script\ncontributes to my liking of this movie, due to amazing dialogue and\ngreat detail upon the current setting.<br><br>If anyone has ever read the script for Fight Club, it's just shy of 200\npages, and that is magnificently impressive. The detail the script goes\ninto is purely astounding, and the lines are written, and performed,\nperfectly. The script, written by Jim Uhls (and based off of the novel\nby Chuck Palahniuk), is incredibly written in near every way, with\ngreat in depth depictions of how each shot was to be set up, and how\nthe actors were to perform their lines.<br><br>The direction, by David Fincher, is exemplary, with great camera angles\nand surprisingly memorable shots. The shot I remember most particularly\nis when Tyler Durden is delivering the final rule of fight club (that\nbeing the eighth), and the camera zooms on the side of his face,\npassing his head and spinning quickly to the next shot of two men\nfighting. Every single shot, like the one just mentioned, is brilliant,\nexcellently pulled off by Fincher.<br><br>The characters, combined with the talented acting behind them, is also\nvery unique. Although the Narrator is supposed to be a boring everyday\nman, the viewer cares for his situations deeply. Throughout the film,\nhe breaks the fourth wall multiple times, and this adds a very personal\nlevel the caring for him through the entire run time of the film.\nNorton plays this character wonderfully, thanks to his great acting\nabilities. The character of Tyler Durden is easily one of the best, and\ncoolest, characters ever put to film. Every line that Pitt delivers as\nTyler is flawless, and deserves all the recognition that a character,\nand his actor, could ever receive.<br><br>The other characters, such as Bonham Carter's Marla, Meat Loaf's Bob,\nand Jared Leto's Angel Face, are also amazing. The audience quickly\nsympathizes with everybody in the film, thanks to great acting and\ndialogue. Once again, the script's lines are written and delivered\nflawlessly, with each actor giving his or her line ideally. Each\ncharacter is well rounded, and has a great arc throughout the run time\nof Fight Club.<br><br>The pacing of Fight Club is also astounding. An almost 2 hour 30 minute\nfilm goes by as if the story is told in 20 minutes, and flies by so\nquickly. This is mostly due to the quick, yet detailed, script, and\nfantastic direction. Both Fincher and Uhls make this movie zoom by, as\nif no time has gone by at all. Each of the actors also contribute to\nthis aspect, ultimately making the film feel very short.<br><br>The last thing I'll mention is the plot twist. Without spoiling\nanything, Fight Club has one of, if not the, best plot twists in film\nhistory. Everything throughout the film sets up for the twist, yet we,\nthe audience, don't pick up on the clues when watching the film for the\nfirst time. Fight Club is a rare type of film in which contains a\nbetter experience watching it for the second time than watching it for\nthe first. The twist is perfectly built up to, and flawlessly executed\nin every way.<br><br>Overall, Fight Club is one of my favorite films of all time, and I like\nto say that it's one of the best movies ever made. I'd recommend Fight\nClub to anyone that can handle violence and language, because it's\ntruly worth anyone's time.\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>>, <bound method Tag.get_text of <p><a href=""reviews-enter"">Add another review</a></p>>]]"
